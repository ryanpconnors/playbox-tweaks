		<name>Action Fighter</name>
		<desc>This is a top down vertically scrolling shooter, in which you start off as a motorbike. You are quite vulnerable to attack at first, but power ups come in the form of a Sega van which you have to dock with. The first time you dock you get double fire, the second time gives you a rocket, the third gives a rear force field and the fourth invulnerablility.

By destroying cars and bikes that appear on your way, you can collect A-F letters. Collecting A through to D allows you change into a sportscar which is less vulnerable to attack, but not as nimble. Collect all the letters in order to be able to transform into a high tech plane. This is the final stage of one of the five missions. Only the high tech plane can guide you to your destination in which your main target is hiding.

There is also time limit in which you have to complete the mission. It is advisable to transform into the high tech plane as fast as it is possible.

Picking up flags gives you bonus points with 10,000 points gaining you an extra life.</desc>

		<name>Adidas Championship Tie-Break</name>
		<desc>This tennis simulation uses a top-down scrolling perspective. You are not in control of the player's motion, but once he gets close to the ball, shot selection is down to you. Standard shots plus topspin, lobs and stop volleys are available, by pushing the joystick in the right direction as you aim the shot.

The game supports up to 16 players in singles matches on a variety of court surfaces.  It includes all of the major world tournaments - the four Grand Slam events at Melbourne, Roland Garros, Wimbledon and New York, plus the Davis Cup and Masters events.  An early attempt at TV-style coverage is offered.

		<name>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons : Death Knights of Kry</name>
		<desc>Death Knights of Krynn is the 2nd volume of the Dragonlance epic and is the sequel to Champions of Krynn. Characters from that game may be imported to this game.



This time the party faces an undead threat that turns former friends into fierce enemies and infests Krynn with hordes of decaying monsters. The party must find the origin of these nightmarish undead creatures and eliminate it in order to save Krynn from turning into a land of undead. 



Like Champions of Krynn, Death Knights of Krynn introduces a different and unique character selection with the availability of the "Knight" class, unavailable in AD&amp;D non-Dragonlance RPGs. Characters in this game may level-up to higher levels and obtain new skills as well as more powerful spells. Experienced Knights may ultimately choose one out of 3 "clans" to focus more on a different type of fighting style.</desc>

Once the party is created, the player begins the exploration of the city of Phlan. Upon exiting the city, the player explores a top-down map, visiting dungeons and other locations of interest, as well as engaging in combat.</desc>

		<name>Aladdin</name>
		<desc>The game from Virgin based on the 1992 animated Disney film is a side-scrolling platformer.

The player controls Aladdin, who must make his way through several levels based on locations from the movie: from the streets and rooftops of Agrabah, the Cave of Wonders and the Sultan's dungeon to the final confrontation in Grand Vizier Jafar's palace. The Sultan's guards and also animals of the desert want to hinder Aladdin in his way. He can defend himself with his sword or by throwing apples. Next to apples, Aladdin can also collect gems which can be traded for lives and continues with a traveling trader. Finding Genie or Abu icons enables bonus rounds. The Genie bonus round is a game of luck played for apples, gems or extra lives. In Abu's bonus round, the player controls the little monkey who has to catch bonus items that fall from the sky, but without touching any of the unwanted objects like rocks and pots.

The game's humorous animations were created by Walt Disney Feature Animation.</desc>

		<desc>Alien3 is a video game based on the movie of the same name. The plot of the movie picks up directly after the end of Aliens. Ellen Ripley, the main character of the Alien series, is in cryo-sleep aboard the space ship Sulaco. Unfortunately, an alien or two has stowed away on the Sulaco, and wreaked havoc within the ship. Thus, it crash lands on the prison colony planet Fiorina 161. Ripley and the unarmed prisoners have to figure out a way to survive the aliens terrorizing the colony until help arrives.

The gameplay of the various Alien³ conversions varies from platform to platform. This version is a side-scrolling action game with large maze-like levels. In each level, you have to rescue all the trapped prisoners and then make your way to the exit, all while surviving multiple alien attacks.</desc>

		<name>Alien Breed 3D 2 - The Killing Grounds</name>
		<desc>Alien Breed 3D II: The Killing Grounds is a first-person 3D shooter with full-screen graphics. The story is directly connected to the ending of the predecessor: after a hard day's work the protagonist gets rescued by a space cruiser. But unfortunately shortly after an alien ship crosses their path and kidnaps the crew - now the player has 16 new levels to progress through in one-player mode. The action offers the usual DOOM-inspired gameplay: shooting everything in sight by using the ten weapons with limited ammo and searching for key cards. The enemies are working together and trying to adjust their approach depending on which of the many weapons the player is armed with.

There is no music within the levels, just ambient sounds. A level editor is provided, which is especially useful for the two-player game.</desc>

This release was in a similar vein, but set into a 3D context, making for the Amiga's first big Doom-style game. The 3D engine uses fairly small screen graphics, but these include full floors and ceilings with detailed shading, doors, vertical position variations, lifts and transporters. The CD version includes extra atmospheric sound, while fast processors and extra FastRAM are also supported.</desc>

For each of the organs to be destroyed, a specific weapon can be created to cleanse it easier - blueprints must be collected and taken back to your ship for this.</desc>

Each side plays as an Adept - a powerful wizard with the ability to cast spells against other Adepts and his summonings - and must defeat the other side, either Chaos or Order, by attacking him/her with summoned Elementals or Demons. Each side can summon 4 unique elementals at a time or choose from 4 demons, common to both.

Gameplay is similar to the original, reminiscent of a chess-like board game, requiring strategy, but with arcade elements, especially when two adepts confront each other face-to-face. The board also shifts from time to time, making the strategy less predictable.</desc>

The game itself is a mixture between graphics adventure, space combat simulator and strategy game. The adventure part is realized in a classic 2D point-and-click environment, the space combat can be best described as a small version of Firebird's Elite, and the various small arcade games included can either be played in a strategic mode or an arcade mode where your reaction skills are required.</desc>

		<name>B.C. Kid</name>
		<desc>B.C. Kid, or Bonk's Adventure is a 2D platform video game developed by Red Company and Atlus that was released in 1989-1990 for the TurboGrafx-16. In Japan it was released as PC Genjin (PCÃ¥Å½Å¸Ã¤ÂºÂº?) in 1989, a play on the Japanese name for the system, 'PC Engine'. The game was re-released for the TurboGrafx-16 in the U.S. in 1992 on the Gate of Thunder 4-in-1 game CD-ROM. The game was later ported to the NES, Game Boy, Amiga, arcade systems under different titles (FC Genjin, GB Genjin and BC Genjin). It is also available through Nintendo's Virtual Console service, on the PlayStation Store and there is a version for mobile phones in Japan.

Bonk attacks enemies by "bonking" them with his large, invincible forehead. Bonk starts the game with three hearts' worth of health, which are depleted to blue as Bonk takes damage, and three extra lives. Bonk's health can be restored in increments by collecting fruits and vegetables.

Bonk can also collect pieces of meat as power-ups; these lend him special abilities and make him stronger. There are three stages of power-up: his normal self, a second stage during which he can stun enemies by pounding on the ground, and a third stage where he becomes temporarily invulnerable. Meat can be found in two varieties: big meat and small meat. The effects of meat are additive but wear off over time. A small meat gives Bonk the second stage of meat power and a large one takes him to stage three. Eating a small meat while in stage two will also put Bonk into the third, invincible stage of meat power. When the third stage effect wears off he returns to the second state and remains there for a while before turning back to the regular Bonk. Eating either size of meat while in the third stage of meat power-up will reset the timer on Bonk's meat power.

Bonk can occasionally collect red heart power-ups that refill an entire heart worth of health, or even more rarely, a large red heart, which restores all of Bonk's missing health. There are also two rare, blue heart power-ups in the game which will increase Bonk's maximum health by one heart.

Bonking an enemy will typically knock it backward and slightly into the air. Defeating an enemy yields points and also releases a small "smiley" power-up. Bonk's smileys are totaled at the end of each stage after defeating the boss of that stage. The player is given additional points and a caveman type congratulation based on how many smileys were collected.</desc>

Two human players can take part, but only the winner continues without using up credits, so you will only see the early races in two-player mode. 

You are armed with guns, which can be used to slow opposing cars. During the races spanners can be collected, which are then cashed in for upgraded turbos, improved weaponry and engine upgrades. Hazards on the later tracks include ramps, bridges, buildings collapsing onto the track and barriers which open and close in a random sequence.

Many of the enemies have good hiding places and can emerge surprisingly, Commando-style.

		<desc>Not to be confused with Barbarian II: Dungeons of Drax - a game by Palace Software - Barbarian II is a direct sequel to an action/pointnclick hybrid released four years earlier. Developed by Pandamonium Entertainment and published by the legendary Psygnosis (Shadow of the Beast, Ork, Agony), the game continues the tale of Hegor the Barbarian.

After being improperly defeated some years ago, evil lord Necron has been reincarnated by one of his cult followers. Now only Hegor is strong, courageous, and stupid enough to face Necron and his minions.

Unlike the original Barbarian, which was an action game with a bizarre pointnclick control interface, Barbarian II plays just like a typical action/adventure title with a maze-like layout. During his adventures, Hegor will visit many interesting locales like a forest full of thugs, werewolves and spiky pits, a long, long cave, a semi-friendly human city, a dungeon, and finally Necrons temple. All areas are huge, confusing, and full of enemies and traps.

The game consists of five stages based on events from the movie. Each stage has a time limit and a health gauge (represented by Batman's face turning into the Joker's), with Batman losing a life if he runs out of either. The first stage sees players controlling Batman as he navigates the Axis Chemical Plant to confront Jack Napier, leading to the incident in which he becomes The Joker. In this level, the game features side-scrolling gameplay, in which Batman can use his Batarangs to defeat enemies or and his grapple gun to reach higher platforms and swing across gaps. In the second level, Batman rides in his Batmobile where he must dodge traffic and use a grapple to swing around corners to avoid running into the police. The third level is a puzzle section in which Batman must identify various components for Smilex, the deadly chemical Joker has put into the market. The fourth level takes place during Joker's parade, in which Batman must use the Batwing to cut away balloons filled with poisonous gas without hitting the balloons themselves. Finally, the fifth level, which reprises the gameplay of the first level, sees Batman make his way to the top of Gotham Cathedral to finally confront Joker.</desc>

		<name>Battle Chess</name>
		<desc>Battle Chess is a quite typical chess game, but it comes with a twist: all pieces are represented by small, realistic figures that walk around on the chessboard, and when one piece takes another, they both take part in an animated battle. There is a different animation for each permutation, depending on which pieces are capturing or being captured. You can also play in 2D without animation. 

The game's opening library includes 30,000 different moves, ensuring a variety of games will unfold across the 10 skill levels. 

Multi-player support can be extended to modem and/or serial port play.

		<desc>Battle Command is a 3D arcade/strategy game, loosely derived from the same developers' Carrier Command. In a near future alternate reality, the Ultra War is fought between the two dominate races in the New World. The 'Mauler' is the latest technology - an Armored Fighting Machine capable of being lifted in and out of hostile territory by a fast Stealth Chopper, and armed with the most advanced weaponry science can devise.

You command a single "Mauler" assault tank in one of a series of scenarios. These range from a railway ambush to escort duties and a raid on a riverside hideout. Before starting you must choose the right weaponry based on the mission briefing.

Some Merry Men have grey suits - this marks them out as joyless and awkward characters which must be guided through a coloring machine.

The Miniation people have loaded the 60 levels with various nasties, ranging from slugs (slow, but must be jumped), Rock Men (those with sharp backs are more dangerous, but both are quite nippy), spiked teeth emerging from manholes, and so on. A large map is provided, and at any point you can pause the game and scroll around the map, which makes the forward planning easier.

		<name>Betrayal</name>
		<desc>Betrayal is a Strategy game, developed and published by Rainbird, which was released in Europe in 1991.

The West Marches is ruled by a duopoly. The King and Bishop each has a court filled by courtiers presented by the knights of the land - you are one of them. Now, courtiers hold great influence as all matters of State are put to a vote in the respective Courts. If, by some chance or design, one of the knights could have more courtiers in each Court than any other then that knight would gain a majority. A chance to seize power and depose both Bishop and King would then present itself, replacing them with a suitable puppet ruler. If both Courts are so ruled then that knight is declared the winner. This is your task.

In Betrayal, four knights battle it out: managing estates, collecting taxes, creating armies, declaring war on a regular basis, spying and other noble acts. After a difficulty level has been decided upon in addition to other game options, you must travel to different villages. Villages supply taxes, wheat (the harvest of which you must personally initiate), pottery to sell and militias (for defense and for your army). A self-sufficient village is your aim, otherwise you'll have to finance it out of your own pocket. You'll also have to watch out for your popularity which, if it falls below a specified level, will result in rebellion.

At Court you must have at least 13 courtiers to overthrow the King or Bishop. To gain courtiers you must pay regular taxes, assassinate other courtiers, accuse them of treason and so on.
When traveling you will see your knight on horseback, traversing the countryside between villages. During this time he can find cash lying around on the floor and be mugged by... er, muggers. Combat is a simple arcade beat-'em-up viewed side-on.
Actually it is in the combat area that the whole game falls down. Here we have a game which promotes quite a bit of depth in its gameplay. Intrigue, assassinations, treason, economics etc, all combine to make a promising game. Then the combat comes along and spoils it. The combat is far too simplistic and lacking in any skill or judgement to be of any use to anybody. It reduces the game to a lottery. Frustrating, as combat is an important area of the game. What a shame.</desc>

		<name>Bill's Tomato Game</name>
		<desc>Bill's Tomato Game is a puzzle game similar to the ones in the Incredible Machine series. Completely mouse-controlled, the game is divided in a series of non-scrolling screens, each one being a puzzle. The main objective is to move an anthropomorphic tomato from the left side of the screen to a conveyor belt on the right side. Several objects hinder progress by squishing, perforating, exploding and destroying the tomatoes. The player has an infinite number of them, but a time constraint is in place: a timer runs in the bottom left of the screen. The tomato movement can be started and stopped by clicking a semaphore on the bottom of the screen (the screen objects move independently, with their own timing). In order to solve the levels, you pick various gadgets at the bottom of the screen and place them according to your strategy. These gadgets are:

? An electric fan that can boost and alter your tomato's trajectory;

? A trampoline where the tomato can bounce and reach new heights;

? A Jack-In-The-Box to eject the tomato upwards;

? A blocking box to stop the tomato's movement.

Each pilot you can fly different missions and aircraft, but only those from your own side.

The player character flies from three land bases and two aircraft carriers on each side, and these bases can be damaged in several ways by enemy action, making them unavailable until repaired and reducing the available aircraft in the campaign.
Mission types are:
air intercept
air superiority
long range bombing
bomber escort
close support and ground attack
border or sea patrol
reconnaissance
troop drop
supply drop
stealth bombing
stealth reconnaissance
test pilot
An autopilot mode is available for longer cruises, if the enemies are far off. The 'test pilot' mission involves flying the X-15/X-29 and is not a part of the campaign.</desc>

		<name>Blobz</name>
		<desc>Not the most inspiring name for a game, but then look at Worms and how successful that title was. Blobz steals its gameplay style directly from Lemmings, replacing the suicidal rodents with green nondescript things decked out with tiny eyes.

While Lemmings' motivation for suicide is biological, blobs just don't know any better. If they walk into spikes or water they die, but there's no stopping them. A walking they will go, straight into trouble. The puzzles themselves are satisfying, if frustrating and they have been well thought out using the various 'skills' which you can assign each Blob. Smooth horizontal scrolling and the neat moving water effects and special touches are very nice. While the platforms themselves might look basic, there is a good reason for this: a level designer has been included so you can make as many as you like, and it's simple to use. The game is based on six worlds each mapped out like a maze and there are 60 levels in total.

The amount of levels and the increasing difficulty means that this is not a fast game to finish. Add the possibility of infinite custom levels and you have a lot of game. A well recommended download.</desc>

The player has 4 missions to take on, in each case trying to kill baddies for the money they have, which can be spent in the shop rooms to upgrade their craft. Energy is depleted by contact with enemies and the walls, although there are some baddies who simply hover on your ship and steal, rather than physically doing damage.

The game is a shoot 'em up which scrolls both horizontally and vertically, while being viewed from an R-Type style sideways perspective. Navigating the levels sometimes requires the player to duck through gaps in scenery.

You play as Ransom Stark, a computer hacker, scrounger or mercenary (depending on how the player answers the opening questions when they start a new game) who finds himself caught up in a sinister affair involving an evil global megacorporation, TransTechnicals, Manhattan, a fight for Cyberspace and vampires!

Ransom Stark became stricken with Hopkins-Brie Ontology Syndrome whilst working at TransTechnicals, due to his forced extended exposure to Cyberspace while he worked there. As soon as he was diagnosed he was dismissed from TransTech and found himself homeless and hopeless. Thankfully an ingenious woman, with a personal vendetta against TransTech, named Deirdre Tackett saved his life by inserting a prototype brain implant of her own design and this restoring his grip on reality.

Over the following year Ransom became known as a reliable freelance until one day he got a job worth much more than he bargained for! His employers turned out to be vampires and as part of his 'payment', Ransom was turned into a follower of the evil head-vampire, Abraham Van Helsing -- except his brain implant kicked in allowing him to keep temporary control of his humanity.

Now Ransom must put a stop to Van Helsing's plans to take over Manhattan and control Cyberspace and hopefully save himself from being a vampire before its too late!</desc>

		<name>Bob's Bad Day</name>
		<desc>The reason why Bob's having a bad day is that his head has become detached from his body, and they've been hurtled off into different places. To retrieve his body, he must progress through 50 levels, then a further 50 to escape before he can be put back together.

Gameplay involves the character being on a rotating landscape with a set number of coins placed all over it. By rotating the joystick, the player moves the landscape so that Bob moves over the coins and finds the exit. 

The levels include many spikes, contact with which causes the loss of coins; if the player has no coins when contact is made, it's game over. Some level designs are fiendish, with lots of corridors and alleyways, teleports, and bricks to break through (by building up enough momentum).

There are a host of special 'power-ups' across the level as well. The simplest ones (and the first ones the player will meet) change the direction of gravity, causing the player's character to automatically 'fall' to the left when not in motion. Others include a sticky mode where Bob stops bouncing (unless the player presses the fire button), a heavier-bounce mode, and a very useful one allowing the player to 'thrust' Bob around, ideal for reaching precariously-placed coins.

Once the player reaches level 51 a further twist is added - Bob's body starts in a separate point of the level, and this must also be coaxed to the exit. The view always centers on Bob's head, even once this is in the exit, so the player will have to use the scanner alone to guide the body across - knowing that a move which benefits one can drag the other off course.

		<name>Bombuzal</name>
		<desc>Little Bombuzal has to blow up bombs on little islands in this puzzle game. In order to advance to the next level, all bombs need to detonate. There are various sizes of bombs. Bigger ones have such a huge blast radius that Bombuzal cannot trigger them directly - instead, he has to explode smaller bombs first and cause a chain reaction. So as one might imagine, later levels turn into loud blastfests that need to be carefully planned.

Besides, later levels introduce all kinds of additional hazards and gimmicks, like ice floors, movable bombs, disappearing ground tiles, and much more. Nobody said being a pyromaniac is easy.

		<desc>Mobo and Robo Bonanza are enjoying their favorite television show when the picture crackles and a shadowy figure of a mysterious stranger appears on screen. This figure asks them to collect certain items that he has placed inside various buildings to test his security force. If they return the items successfully, Mobo and Robo will be rewarded. The two of them state that they will get the job done in just three minutes. However, little do they know that each building is packed with security guards who will raise the alarm if they are caught red-handed. Fortunately both Mobo and Robo are equipped with bullets that can knock the guards unconscious for a few seconds. An $100 reward will be given out if Mobo and Robo are apprehended.

As either Mobo or Robo, you must collect all the treasures before leaving the ten buildings and shoot any security guards that get in your way. Remember that you are under a time limit. An in-game map will help you locate the treasures. There is a bonus stage after three buildings, where the object is to collect the gold bars in a limited amount of time without  one of the three spotlights shining on you. If it is possible, hide behind open doors. If you manage to get all the gold bars, 10,000 points is added to your score. There are three of these bonus stages, but each of them varies.

		<name>Bram Stoker's Dracula</name>
		<desc>Bram StokerÃ¢â¬â¢s Dracula. Odd name for a game really Ã¢â¬â Dracula would have sufficed. I mean, itÃ¢â¬â¢s not as if thereÃ¢â¬â¢s Mary ShelleyÃ¢â¬â¢s Dracula knocking around. Anyway, the Count has borrowed your fiancÃÂ©e, probably intending to commit bloody deeds at some point and your task, surprisingly enough, is to rescue her. And knock Dracula out for the count. The vampire has many friends including henchmen and small, evil animals which suck the very lifeblood out of you. But worst of all, thereÃ¢â¬â¢s the Brids of Dracula. Gulp!

Set over nine stages, Bram's golden egg combines platform action with elements of the beat-em-up genre. The hero (thatÃ¢â¬â¢s you Ã¢â¬â if you buy the game) is called Jonathan and heÃ¢â¬â¢s blessed with the sweetest two feet since Eric Cantona, a punch straighter than Lennox Lewis and a wardrobe nattier than George ArmaniÃ¢â¬â¢s. Scattered around the dank castle halls are coffins to kick, cross to brandish and bottles of blood to sup.

Dracula basically involves a lot of wandering around, kicking small animals and dead folk in such exotic locations as taverns, convents, castles and asylums. Graphically, it looks OK but unfortunately it all gets rather dreary after a while. "Dracula, you can keep my fiancÃÂ©e. I canÃ¢â¬â¢t really be bothered".</desc>

You do this indirectly, by specifying which direction he goes in, in a manner vaguely similar to Lemmings. You also tell him when to use objects in a simplistic manner similar to the Dizzy games.

The game combines reactions and planning in quite an original way. The character himself isn't at all cutesy, as the title implies, and that may affect your perception of the game.

		<name>Breach 2</name>
		<desc>An early squad-level tactical combat game, much like the X-Com series of games and the more contemporary Laser Squad. Breach 2 features turn-based combat from an isometric point of view set in the far future. As one of the more unique aspects the squad leaders gain experience from successful missions should they survive.

Breach 2 is set in the same sci-fi universe as Omnitrend's Universe and Rules of Engagement series and shares the same backstory with those games. Breach 2 is a part of the IGS (Interlocking Game System) and compatible with the two Rules of Engagement games. This means you can use Breach 2 to resolve the tactical combat situations, boarding an enemy ship for example, you run into in the starship command simulation, which is the heart and soul of the Rules of Engagement series.

A scenario builder is included with the game, making it possible to create your own missions and trade them.

		<desc>In Breathless, the human race has been enslaved by evil alien overlords. But some rebel groups haven't given up hope yet and fight against the oppressors. When one of them gets caught, they are being transformed into cyborgs and stuck in complicated mazes that function as arenas, where they have to fight for their honour and maybe their freedom.

Breathless is a first-person-shooter, where the player has to navigate various stages infested with enemies out to get them. The player has a status display at the bottom of the screen. It contains the current score, the remaining health and shield as well as energy and credits. Energy functions as a universal ammo stock, with each of the weapon depleting a certain amount. By picking up credits, the player can buy or upgrade weapons at computer terminals.

The player's goal is to reach the exit of each of the 20 levels. However, there are usually doors in the way that have to be opened by finding the right switches, or obtaining certain key cards to progress further into the maze.

		<desc>Bubble Bobble is the story of two humans, Bub and Bob who wander into the mysterious cave of monsters and magically turn into dinosaurs. The only way to transform back is to reach the end of the cave...

Bubble Bobble is a platform game, with each level being a single screen. The enemies must be cleared from a level to go to the next one. With one player controlling Bub and the other controlling Bob, the player can jump and collect items for points (such as fruit). The real power Bub and Bob have however is the ability to blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms. Taking too long to complete any level will summon Baron Von Blubba, who will float around the screen trying to destroy the player.

		<desc>Bubble and Squeak starts off similarly to many other platform games. Controlling a bald child, you move through a scrolling array of ledges, avoiding contact with nasties who release coins when shot. There are hidden areas to find as well.

Halfway through the first of the 30 levels, you meet Squeak and the full nature of the game starts. Squeak is a blue alien, who must also be guided through the levels. As he can't jump as high as you, he must sometimes be instructed to wait while you flick a switch or otherwise solve the puzzle of how to guide him through. If you stand on top of Squeak you can be launched into an extra-high jump.

Bubble Mode is an equivalent of Super Mario mode - it allows you to jump higher, run faster and shoot more lethal weaponry (bubbles in this case). It is activated by placing a coin into a Bubblegum machine, and then jumping on Squeak's back.

In between the main platform levels there are side-view shoot 'em up sections taking place underwater  completing these earns bonuses.

		<desc>The RAM (Russo-American Mercantile) organisation is based on Mars. They want to control the Solar System - a natural enough ambition, I suppose. They rule Earth with an iron hand, thus NEO (New Earth Organization) has been formed to counter the tyranny. After Buck Rogers was found and revived from his frozen snooze he joined NEO and helped to remove RAM troops from Earth. However, fear of RAM is still high as they could strike any at time. You join the NEO, one of many new recruits. Buck's task is to form a team, get the hell out into space and put the stellar wind up the dreaded RAM.

Buck Rogers uses an uprated AD&amp;D system although there are many similarities. The swords have been replaced by laser guns, the towns and villages by planets and space stations. You still control a group of six, the menu interface is structured in the same way, even the 'meanwhile' screens appear to have the same artistic 'feel' to them. However, there are many improvements. The complex skill system being the most important.

There is no doubt that Buck Rogers sits firmly as the king of the 'Tactical' RPG castle.</desc>

		<desc>A computerÃ¢â¬â¢s mazelike circuitry is infected with bugs, and you have been sent in to destroy them. You are armed with bombs, mines, blockades, and various types of hatchlings, which when released will track the bugs and hopefully stop them.

The basic gameplay is inspired by Dynablaster, but it differs because there is more than one way to kill the foes off. Depending on which way you push the joystick as you press fire, you will either release a quick-exploding bomb, a proximity mine, or a hatchling. Collecting Ã¢â¬ËENÃ¢â¬â¢ symbols will restore your energy, and Ã¢â¬ËIQÃ¢â¬â¢ symbols increase the ability of your hatchlings to track and hit your foes. Be careful when placing blocks; it is possible to shut yourself in.

The single-player game gives you three lives, plus another when you complete each of the 50 levels. The multi-player game can be played in 2 different ways Ã¢â¬â co-operative (work together to clear the computer of bugs) or competitive (Dynablaster-style free-for-all destruction).</desc>

The offroad course loops around back to the start, the others are long runs with a distinct beginning and ending. You must complete each leg before the time runs out.

Along the way you can pick up all kinds of bonuses. The colored flags are 30 points each, collect all colors in the order as indicated at the top of the screen to get 1000 bonus points. There are several gates the give you 100, 250 or 500 points, and a time gate. Drive through a time gate to collect it, you receive two seconds extra time upon completing a leg. Occasionally there will be a soccer ball on the road, hit it and it will fly away and you get 2000 points.

There are bridges and tunnels, be careful not to fall off the bridge into the water or crash into the tunnel wall. There also are obstacles like boulders, logs and fences. If you hit them it will cost you valuable seconds off your leg time. But if you hit a log or small stone just right, the buggy will ride on two wheels until you hit something again.</desc>

The courses are quite lengthy, and are laden with hazards and power-ups such as oil slicks and homing missiles. The computer cars appear to be faster when behind you than when in front  strange.

The handling is deliberately arcadey, with fast acceleration and braking as well as the chance to brake and steer at the same time. The graphics are third-person, with a split-screen option, in the grand Mario Kart / OutRun tradition.

The route is mapped out beforehand, but it needn?t be strictly adhered to, as the surrounding roads are all presented and can be used as you wish. The computer cars in the race will often deviate from the course as well, adding real navigation to the proceedings. You accrue damage from contact, which needs to be repaired after the race, so you need to keep some prize money coming in. 

The racing is illegal, so you are pursued by police as you go, similarly to Crazy Cars 3, so make sure not to get caught, and do your dangerous driving out of their sight. You?ll have to drive on the correct side of the road and negotiate pedestrians and other traffic as well</desc>

		<desc>The first in the strategy series set in the Roman Empires peak era starts off with you as ruler of a small province, although if youre successful you will get tougher assignments.

You must build the city, placing crucial features such as housing estates, roads, policing, water supply, social events and the like. Youre not restricted to one city  you can build another area, linked by roads, once youve got the first one running smoothly. You have slaves at your disposal to build and maintain everything. 

All this would be easy if you had an infinite supply of money, the civilians didnt complain about anything, there was no threat of combat, and you didnt have to keep the people above you happy. Needless to say, all of these problems crop up.

Via the forums,  you will get public opinions, which are affected by how high taxes are, and whether people feel theyre getting value for money. If they dont they could riot; what will you tell the Emperor if that happens?

Barbarian threats are commonplace, so you need to maintain an army, and at times send it into battle. If you own Cohort 2, you can fight the battles using that, but otherwise you just issue the orders then learn of the result.

		<name>Carrier Command</name>
		<desc>Carrier Command was one of the first real-time strategy games.

You control an advanced cybernetic aircraft carrier complete with fighters, amphibious assault vehicles, laser defenses and a fleet of decoy drones.  Your mission is to build a series of resource, factory, and defensive bases spanning an island chain.  The only problem?  At the other end of the chain is an even more advanced carrier under control of a terrorist organization with the same mission.

As you move around the islands you must decide what facilities to build and where they will best support your advance.  Resource islands provide materials that factory islands can use to build weapons and vehicles to replace your combat losses but both will be quickly overrun if the enemy attacks them while you are not present.  You also have to ensure that your stockpiles of equipment are stored safely until you can find time to launch a resupply drone to bring them to your carrier.

From your carrier, you can take first person control of your attack aircraft and amphibious tanks and use them to assault enemy islands or even the enemy carrier itself if you're lucky enough to find it.  The weapon payloads on your vehicles are completely configurable based on your needs.  An island invasion may require launching a virus bomb that will take over the enemy command systems or just blasting the base with a wire guided surface to surface missile.

Ultimately, you have to find and destroy the enemy carrier but, doing so will require a solid supply infrastructure and a strategy for depriving your opponent of his.

The objective of the game was to drive over every platform in the level which changed the platform in some way (for example, in the construction zone the platforms are girders with holes for rivets. A rivet would appear in the hole once it was driven over), once every platform was run over Arnie would be picked up by a helicopter and taken to the next level. At the end of three levels, Arnie would rescue an animal friend and continue on to the next themed level.</desc>

Gameplay combines action and puzzle-solving, across four primary towers with three levels each. Doors must be opened using one of the ten included keys. These are unmarked, as are the various potions - making it a challenge to know which keys open which doors, and which potions are beneficial. 

Contact with ghouls drains your energy, as does falling too far (there are narrow pathways to negotiate), while eating cheese can replenish this. Movement and aiming are controlled separately.

		<name>Centurion : Defender of Rome</name>
		<desc>Starting as a young Roman legionnaire in 275BC, your job is to conquer the known world through force or diplomacy, fighting on land and sea. 

Centurion: Defender of Rome is a turn-based strategy game. You start with one province, Rome, and one legion. To complete the game, you have to conquer all the provinces on the map. 

One part of the game is micro-managing your provinces. You set up tax rates and make people happy by organizing games. In Rome, you can organize a chariot race, a gladiatorial combat or even a simulated naval battle; this starts an action mini-game where you control the chariot rider, gladiator or ship. 

Another part of the game is military conquest. You can raise legions or strengthen them in any province you control (let's just hope there are enough men in the province, or your legion will be incomplete and weaker). There are three types of legions, each of them has a different strength. You can also move a legion to a neighbouring province. 

When you enter a province you don't yet control, you can speak with the ruler there. With luck, you can convince him to give you the province for free; but this isn't very likely, and you'll often have to fight. 

When your legion attacks a province, or defends one of your provinces from an invader, the game switches to an isometric view of the battlefield. You can give orders to your legion (assuming they are within the range of their commander's voice) and watch as they duke it out with the enemy forces. Eventually, one of the sides will be completely wiped out or panic and retreat. 

Finally, you can buy warships and have naval battles with the enemy fleet. This is represented as an action mini-game, depicting a duel of the flagships; however, the outcome of the battle actually depends on the strength of your fleet.</desc>

There were 6 characters available in the game, each with different strengths and weaknesses, and different starting prices. In 2-player mode you each chose a character and played co-operatively, but in one-player games you also choose a character for the computer to control, with its Artificial Intelligence allowing it to open doors, pick up power-ups and take on baddies away from the ones occupying your character.

You need to find enough metal for Explora to be able to return you to your place in time. The original point-and-click interface (text-based with auxiliary icons) was replaced by a fully icon driven one. There's a row of icons at the bottom of the screen with movement arrows, a save game icon, "get", "give", "examine", etc. The conversations with characters have a basic form of speech-synthesis which can be turned off (the full text of the dialogue is displayed either way).

The levels each occupy a single screen, and are made up of platforms, ladders and lifts (or elevators), and are thus similar to those in classic platform game Donkey Kong. Corn can also be collected, which stops the time limit from ticking down and also stops the bonus, collected when the level is completed, from decreasing. The ducklings also eat the corn, however.

There are only 8 distinct levels. The ninth level is a copy of level 1, the tenth is a copy of level 2, and so on. However, on the second time around the ducklings that can use the platforms and ladders are replaced by the Mother Duck, who can fly around the level going through the platforms and ladders. On the third time around, you have to face both the Mother Duck and the ducklings, and similarly on subsequent goes round, when there are more ducklings.</desc>

The usual options apply, like configuring your aircraft, and choosing a pilot, but there are some more unusual options, like calling in sick for a mission. This causes you to skip a mission if you don't like the sound of it, but if you use it too much command may get suspicious.

The flight model is realistic, and there are some animations. One feature missing from the PC version is the strategic side - you control the ground operations while flying to support them on the Amiga version.

		<desc>It is the ninth century, and Camelot, the legendary castle ruled by King Arthur, has fallen under a curse. Famine and drought plague the kingdom because of the love triangle between the king, his wife Gwenhyver, and the knight Launcelot. It appears that only the mysterious Holy Grail can restore Camelot, and three knights - Launcelot, Gawaine, and Galahad - embark on a journey to find it, and soon disappear without trace. King Arthur leaves his castle in search of the missing knights, hoping to locate the Grail as well. His quest takes him to real and mythical locations in England, and later to Jerusalem and other areas of the Holy Land.nnnnConquests of Camelot is an adventure game that requires the player to input text commands, mostly by combining verbs and objects (such as "look man", "take purse", etc.). A few commands (such as "ask about") have keyboard shortcuts. Unlike most other adventures, the game does not focus extensively on inventory-based puzzles. Rather, it presents a diverse array of tasks depending on concrete situations. These involve exploration, solving riddles, gathering information, participating in arcade sequences such as jousting, and others. Rudimentary money management is present as well. nnnnMany problems have different solutions, and it is possible to reach the final part of the game even without having completed some of the essential quests (e.g. failing to save the knights). However, Arthur is being judged by the game in three different categories: skill (referring to the action sequences), wisdom (evaluating the amount of cultural information gathered), and soul (determining the moral value of Arthur's action). Failure to achieve a high score in the last category leads to a bad ending.nnnnThe game is set in a concrete historical period, but adds an alternate reality to it, assuming that pagan deities really existed, but were overshadowed by Christian worship. However, there are only a few references to real religious practices of the time or any historical characters.</desc>

		<desc>The inhabitants of the pretty but insignificant planet Blot decided to leave to find a trendier planet, and escape being called the Blotians, a most unhip name. Until they such a planet, they call themselves the Fuzzy Wuzzies.

Their colony ship collides with an asteroid, and crash lands in the Pacific Ocean, near an unchartered island, which they colonise, calling it "The Hippest Place in The Known Universe". Unfortunately the island is also home to rather nasty demons, who can't stand the commotion caused by the happy Fuzzies, or their silly name for the island.

The demons kidnap the Fuzzy Wuzzies by hosting a massive party, then capturing them in a net, and dragging them off to the torture chambers. The only Fuzzy not caught is Clyde Radcliff, who was already being sick in the bushes. He wakes up in the morning with a really bad headache, and fiery halitosis, and sets out to destroy the demons, and rescue his friends.

The game consists of 3 levels, each made up of 3 of stages. The first two stages of each level are side scrolling platformers, where Clyde must destroy the enemies by firing at them, presumably using his halitosis. At the end of each of these stages, Clyde meets a witch, who can provide him with extra firing patterns, or upgrade those he has, in exchange for 'magic potion creatures' found during the stages.</desc>

When Inspector Raoul Dusentier is invited to a cruise upon a mighty sailing ship by the wealthy businessman Niklos Karaboudjan, he looks forward to nothing but a relaxing week on the sea. Instead, his host manages to get himself killed on the second day. Murdered, to be exact. Too convenient that a policeman is aboard -- Dusentier sets out to search for suspects. He doesn't need to search long. Why is it that none of the family members seem awfully sad about the demise of the old man? Is the mysterious Father Fabiani really as pious as he says? In the tradition of Agatha Christie, each and every person on board has a motive for the murder.</desc>

It is your job to prevent this. In the maddeningly short time frame, you will have to explore the galaxy (which contains 9 planets and 19 moons) and try to find a way to stop the comet.

Just like Mercenary, you play this game in the first person perspective, this time however with detailed filled polygon graphics. You can walk on the planets, drive vehicles and fly spaceships. It is very non-linear, you can go to any planet and any moon at any time and do whatever you like. You'll have to find and use objects and examine buildings and places... and stay away from Eris if you can't destroy Damocles in time!</desc>

You play Mike Dawson, an ad company manager who, in pursuit of his goal in life to become a writer, purchases a solitary mansion in a small town called Woodland Hills. Although the low cost and hush-hush transactions when purchasing the house do raise your suspicion, the solitary environment and sheer beauty of the house crush common sense and you decide to buy the house. That's when trouble begin. Upon reaching the house, you suddenly feel tired. You find a bed and fall asleep...

... and wake up from a terrible dream, only to find out that your life has just become a worse nightmare: an unknown source has implanted a seed of darkness in your mind, and you only have three days to find a way to stop it.</desc>

		<desc>The Defender gameplay was the basis for this shoot 'em up, with a horizontally-scrolling landscape which eventually loops back on itself. Your basic task is to pick up each of the 8 pods in turn, and carry them through a portal elsewhere in the level, before going back for another one. 

There are power-ups available, representing an auto-fire (Surely one of the earliest software implementations of this), extra simultaneous lasers, missiles to home in on the Landers as they attack, a level-skip, and a Super Shield.

As standard in Defender games, Lander craft are also there to pick up the pods, and these must be stopped before reaching the top of the screen, as both the Lander and Pod become fearsome enemies if they do. If you shoot the Lander, the pod drops back to the ground, for you to retrieve. Unusually, you don't have to wait for the Lander to attack before picking up a pod. 

You must shoot all enemies to progress to the next level, at which point you get a bonus for the number of remaining pods. Every four levels the pods are replenished, which means that losing them on the first of each set of 4 levels (1,5,9,13 etc.) reduces your next four bonuses. If you don't save at least one pod on each level, your will have to face tougher enemies, and without your shield being replenished.

		<name>Déjà Vu II : Lost in Las Vegas</name>
		<desc>Deja Vu II: Lost in Las Vegas is a point-and-click adventure game, the sequel to Deja Vu: a Nightmare Comes True!!, set in the world of 1940s hard-boiled detective novels and movies.

When the original Deja Vu was first released on the Macintosh its software technology caused quite a sensation. Two more games in the same format followed, Shadowgate and Uninvited, and now a sequel to the original has arrived.
Deja Vu II uses the full windowing capabilities of the Amiga, and play is almost 100% by mouse. Word icons are used to enter command verbs, and the picture and/or a graphical representation of a carried object is used to complete the command. Click on EXAMINE, and then click on an object in the picture, and a description of it is displayed in the text window. More common verbs like TAKE or DROP are executed by simply dragging the required object from picture into an INVENTORY window and vice versa.

If that is not enough, there is extensive animation within the picture. But, disappointingly, on the Amiga there is no sound Ã¢â¬â and the digitised sound of a railway station, with steam trains arriving and porters shouting Ã¢â¬ËAll aboard!Ã¢â¬â¢ is sadly absent in comparison with the Atari ST version. The Amiga picture, too, when using a TV, is of poorer quality than that on the ST, and the window titles are very indistinct.

Deja Vu II is a worthwhile but not an easy game. How can you get past the morgue attendant, for example? To what use can you put the hidden secrets you uncover in JoeÃ¢â¬â¢s Bar? Attention to detail and perseverance are needed to progress through the story, but will prove rewarding and result in an entertaining and enjoyable adventure.</desc>

		<desc>Edgar M. Vigdal: "Deluxe Galaga is based on the game StarBattle on the old VIC20. That was one excellent game, that I had a lot of fun with. It's also some features from the games Galaga and Galaxions. I played Galaga on an arcade machine, but it was so long ago that I have forgotten how it looked like. My version of Galaga (or StarBattle) is a simple shoot'em up game with good game play, but not so much fancy graphics. Many of today games have lots and lots of graphics, but when it comes to game play they really sucks. They have manuals covering hundreds of pages, and you need hours and days to get into the game.  What I want from a game is some relaxation for a couple of minutes, and then be able to quit the game and do some more work. And not to mark the calendar for when I want to play the 60MB hi-tech game!

You are in control of a small starfighter, and your mission is to protect the earth from alien attackers. When you start, your ship have limited supply of bullets and are moving a bit to slow, but by shooting the aliens you can collect the falling bonuses and get all sorts of weapons, extra speed and a lot of other goodies! When you are hit, some of the weapon power is lost and also speed and any bonus time you have collected. This loss is bigger on the hard level. There are double shoot, triple shoot, super weapon, extra life, smart bombs, money, warps, secret bonus level and much more to be collected and added to the starfighter. Look out for mother ships, rockets, warp malfunctions, super guardians and Super Cash Ship! There is also a lot of secrets in the game, you can find this secrets yourself, or you can buy them in space-shop. The space-shop will appear every fourth level, but you must have more than 50 credits to enter the shop. There are more than 10 secrets hidden in the game and some that are not listed in the game!

The Sub Games: 
Meteor Storm: You must navigate you ship through a field of big rocks floating in space. Some of the rocks have bonus point on surface and can be collected. There are also some money containers floating around. Collect these and get some extra shopping money.  You will get a super bonus if you complete the meteor storm.
The Memory Station:  Try and find a pair (Two blocks that look the same) in a matrix of blocks. If you find a pair you will get the bonus that are one the blocks. You only have limited time to find as many pairs as possible. If you find all the pairs you will get a bonus.
The Warp Malfunction: Shoot and try to survive the attack of the warped beast from outer hyperspace."</desc>

		<name>Deuteros : The Next Millennium</name>
		<desc>Deuteros: The Next Millennium is the sequel to the sci-fi strategy video game Millennium 2.2, published by Activision for the Amiga and Atari ST.

While the game shares themes of space exploration and resource gathering - plus some elements of its interface - with its predecessor, the two are different in gameplay.

The object of Deuteros is to mine and manage resources, explore the Solar System and beyond. For this, 3 categories of civilians are trained: Producers, Researchers and Marines, out of a pool of 6000 population. The longer these teams are used, they are advanced in three levels, required for some later action (some inventions can be manufactured only by a producer who is at "Expert" level while Pilots with the rank of "Admiral" will be more effective in battles).

New bases built on other planets must be manned with new teams of Producers in order to construct the shuttles and derricks needed for supply. Some of these events are "milestones" which will trigger new technology to be researched by the scientists.

The player has to take care mostly of the transaction between the planets and the factories and distribute their supply with shuttles and long-range spacecraft. New technology (such as automatisation computers or teleport) will replace some of the player's involvement, as the player must later concentrate on war.</desc>

Each area has a set amount of money you must raise before moving into the next one. To do so, you must sell your collected treasure to the bank.

You select your "Diggers" by clicking on them with the left mouse button, and making them do a desired action by right-clicking on the screen and choosing from a icon menu.

Each clan has different characteristics and stats: for example the Grablins clan resembles fantasy dwarfs and has the fastest diggers. The Quarriors clan has the strongest miners, less likely to die in a fight with enemy diggers.

		<name>Dogfight : 80 Years of Aerial Warfare</name>
		<desc>Dogfight is a two-player game with roots in the same primordial soup as Atari's Combat and other basic dogfighting games.

The two players take sides in an split-screen air battle above France in 1916. Player one starts off as an English pilot on the left side, and player two flies his red Luftwaffe plane from the strip on the right screen. At the end of each strip is a tree, so lift-off requires precision; too early and you will stall to the ground; too late, and you will crash into a tree.

As the two players fly towards each other, the split screen is joint as they reach visual contact, and likewise split off again if they fly away from each other. If a player is shot down, he must take off again from his base, and the winner gains a point. In the time it takes for the other player to lift off, you are at liberty to fly to his base and bomb both him and his hangar. Beware, though, for there is an AA emplacement at the base. The anti air artillery alternates between slow-moving shots and explosive flak, the latter being much more difficult to avoid. If you manage to bomb the artillery, the opposing player is more or less at your mercy  at least until the artillery is regenerated or if he manages to avoid your bombs and shots to shoot you down.

To spice things up, both sides have zeppelins which enter the game from time to time. The zeppelins are big targets but fire at you with great accuracy. In the middle of the playfield is a lake, where German and English U-boats take turns. They can be bombed, but have the same firepower as the AA batteries.

Control of your plane is imperative. Climbing too fast will put you into a stall, while steep dives will speed up your plane. Flying too high will also result in a stall, though this option can be turned off. If you manage to fly straight at the very top of the screen, you can take a shortcut above the mountain at the back of each air field. This will wrap you around to the opposing end of the screen.

Written in AMOS, Dogfight will let the players go on as long as they want, so the winner is usually he who first reaches a score set according to a gentleman's agreement.

		<name>Dr Dooms Revenge</name>
		<desc>Latverian president Dr. Doom is a terrible enemy, so when he hatches a plan to blow up New York City with a stolen Atomic bomb, one Marvel superhero is not enough to stop him. As the lavishly-drawn comic bundled with the game explains, Spider-Man and Captain America must join forces to go to Latveria and foil his plans.

The main action in the game is a side-scrolling beat 'em up, in which you alternately control the two characters. They each have their own moves to deal with The Rhino, Electro and other foes. Moves are context-sensitive based on the distance between your character and the opponent. Energy bars decrease as you each take hits. After each section you get comic-book sequences as a reward, and to set the scene of the evolving story.</desc>

		<desc>Zambaquous has done everything to make life hell for the people of Agamen, and as their King Kayus, the time has come to head out to destroy him. This leads to six levels of horizontally-scrolling shoot em up action, although with some vertical movement as well.

The thing which sets the game apart from every other horizontally-scrolling shoot em up (except Saint Dragon) is that you are riding on the back of a dragon, called Bahamoot. Both you and the dragon have firepower, and holding down the fire button increases Bahamoots energy bolts ferocity. The dragons tail can be controlled indirectly, and because it is indestructible, it can be used either as a shield, or as a weapon in its own right. 

There are power-ups to collect by dismounting from the dragon and walking into them. These include fiery breath, bolts shot from Bahamoots tail, homing missiles of sorts, and lightning bolts, with only one ever active at a time. Each level has a time limit.

		<desc>Play one of the three evil wizards all competing to find the magical talisman. To do so, the player must hatch, raise, breed dragons, and use them to spread terror and power across the land! Use these dragons and spells to conquer or help numerous villages and cities across the land while devastating the other wizards also seeking control of the land.nnnnDragon Lord introduces different levels of gameplay, which may be categorized as the following:nnAlchemynnThe game introduces a complex process of alchemy. Different ingredients have positive and negative results in combination of different types of Magick equipment used for it. Use alchemy to strengthen (or even weaken) own dragons or use them to cast spells at surrounding villages and cities (as well as some alchemical spells for the player's own benefit). Creating a too powerful spell in the Magick Laboratory may introduce an unpleasant explosion in the lab. Ingredients may be obtained through villager tribute or purchase from traveling merchants. nnnnNote: The game is almost impossible to play without the Alchemical Table of Ingredients.nnnnDragon BreedingnnThe player may breed several individual dragons in the castle. Each require nurturing and patience before they can hatch and even more so after they hatch! Use alchemy spells to help strengthen the dragon eggs (or they may not hatch at all!).nnnnDragon Missions and Political MapnnThis feature gives a top-down perspective of the political map around the land. Send dragons to wreck havoc and terror to the surrounding villages and cities, or use them to explore the region and even protect villages and cities from enemy dragons! Attacking villages and cities may prompt them to surrender themselves under the player's control, providing the damage done is sufficient enough. This is also where the player may control the taxation of villages and cities (under player control) as well as any other information regarding them.nnnnDragon Combat!nnThough optional, the player may enter manual combat (as to automatic combat) and enter a top-down, side-scrolling (vertical) arcade combat when attacking villages or cities. Here the player basically uses a dragon to burn anything that remotely looks like a structure.nnnnNote: If there is an enemy dragon near the area, the enemy dragon will come to the defense of that village or city!</desc>

		<name>Dragonflight</name>
		<desc>Dragonflight is a fantasy role-playing game primarily drawing inspiration from Ultima series. There is no character creation and the player is immediately put in control of the four protagonists as a party. Overworld travel and town navigation are displayed from a top-down perspective; house interiors are not shown graphically. Dungeons, on the other hand, are done in first-person pseudo-3D style, similarly to Dungeon Master. Game progression is non-linear, with the player able to travel to most locations from the onset.

Monsters are sometimes encountered wandering the wilderness, and are also found at fixed locations in the dungeons. When combat initiates, the game switches to a side-scrolling view with a grid displayed above it. The player can move characters over the battle field, attack with melee or ranged weapons, and cast spells, all in a turn-based fashion. Experience points are awarded for vanquishing monsters. Characters can also learn magic by mixing reagents and choosing between the Black and the White schools. The game can be saved at any time on the overworld. There is no auto-mapping feature.</desc>

Drakkhen is a role-playing game with a visual presentation that combines 3D landscapes and 2D interiors. The player's party will travel overland on a flat terrain made up of vectors, on which 2D objects are zoomed (The same type of engine was later used in Eternam). The player will encounter monsters and fight them in real-time combat, and discover the palaces of the dragon lords. Indoors, the player has to find a way through the maze of chambers, solving puzzles and defeating the minions of the Drakkhen. Party members are depicted in four status windows on the left side of the screen, thus allowing to see their current status and equipment at once.</desc>

		<name>Dune II : Battle for Arrakis</name>
		<desc>Dune II is often considered the first mainstream modern real-time strategy game and established many conventions of the genre. Even though set in Frank Herbert's famous Dune universe, the game is only loosely connected to the plot of any of the books or the films based from them. Controlling either of the three Houses, the player must fight a number of battles against the other Houses. In the early levels, the goal is simply to earn a certain number of credits, while in the later missions, all enemies must be destroyed.

The single resource in the game is the Spice, which must be collected by harvesters. The spice is converted to credits in a refinery, which are then spent to construct additional buildings and units. There are two terrain types: buildings can only be constructed on stone, while the Spice is only found on sand. However, units moving on sand attract the large sandworms of Dune, who are virtually indestructible and can swallow even large units whole. As levels progress, new and more advanced buildings and units are made available, including structures like a radar station, a repair facility or defense turrets and, for units, various ground troops, light vehicles and tanks. Each House can construct one unique special unit, and, after building a palace improvement, can unleash a unique palace effect.</desc>

		<name>Dune</name>
		<desc>Based on the legendary Frank Herbert novel of the same name and visually inspired by the 1984 David Lynch movie, Dune is a strategy-adventure hybrid where the player takes the role of young Paul Atreides, the son of Duke Leto. The Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV has given the Atreides House the rights to manage the extraction of the most precious substance in the entire universe - the Melange, commonly known as Spice in the desolate desert planet Arrakis (Dune), the only place in the universe capable of producing the substance. While everything indicates the offer is a trap orchestrated by their enemies the Harkonnen, the Atreides family agrees on moving, as he who controls the spice, controls the universe.

The player arrives in Arrakis with the mission of contacting and convincing the Fremen tribes residing in sietches (desert settlements) near the Atreides palace to harvest the spice. Harvesting is the most important part of the game, required to purchase equipment from the smugglers and appease the emperor. To speed up the process of harvesting, the player can equip the tribes with harvesters to increase production and ornis to protect them from the gigantic protectors of the planet: Shai-Hulud - the sandworms. 

However, the spice doesn't last forever and new sietches must be prospected before having a mining crew assigned, but the player cannot run Southwards forever, as the Harkonnen enemy controls the North of the Planet, dangerously close to the Atreides Palace. Soon after the initial batches are sent to the Emperor, the player will have to actively deal with the Harkonnen, who will try to take control of player Sietches. For those, Fremen tribes can be assigned to military training with Gurney Halleck, but before doing such work Paul must have a certain reputation, gained by the control of Arrakis.

As the game advances, the player will untap Paul's latent powers, as well as meeting other characters from the Dune universe, such as Duke Leto, Jessica, Thufir Hawat, Duncan Idaho, Harah, Chani, Stilgar and Liet Kynes, the mastermind behind the ecological plans on Dune - the ultimate goal.

The gameplay is reminiscent of the 3D dungeon crawl type of role-playing games popularized by Wizardry and The Bard's Tale. However, unlike these games, Dungeon Master features real-time combat, which requires the player to click on the opponent in order to execute an attack. Another notable aspect of the game is its growth system: instead of gathering experience points and leveling up, characters improve by repeatedly using the same action. Spellcasting involves selecting and combining symbols, which can be arranged as rune sequences. The game also allows the player to directly interact with objects in the game world through a point-and-click interface.

		<desc>The black spaceman kidnapped Bomberman's beloved and brought her to his chambers in the castle, far beyond his reach, over the rivers, forest and mountains. Bomberman's job is to save her, battling the sea of the enemies, with only bombs at his disposal.

The range of Bomberman's bomb explosions can be upgraded with time, but if he dies, the range resets back to the minimum range and Bomberman loses his previous skills. Some updates can make Bomberman walk through the walls, increase his speed, and give him some other assets to aid him in his quest to save the woman he loves.

This top-down action-arcade game consists of nine levels per stage, each tougher than the other, and each final one consisting of the boss that will have to be dealt with. Bomberman can move horizontally and vertically and lay down bombs behind him, thus evaporating the enemies, but beware: Bomberman can block himself with his own bomb, and thus become a victim of his own bomb.</desc>

		<name>Elfmania</name>
		<desc>Elfmania is a Fighting game, developed by Terramarque and published by Renegade, which was released in Europe in 1994.

Beautiful, colourful or cute things can often be the most dangerous - they can lull you into a false sense of security and then striking out when least expected, stunning you like a rocket-charged python. Elfmania is such a thing. Who would have thought, after Streetfighter 2, Body Blows and Mortal Kombat, that what's basically a bunch of fighting fairies would inspire an office into aggressive bouts of one-on-one fisticuffs and high-pitched screaming.

In single-player mode you start off with cash in the form coins which buy the services of fighters. More experienced ones cost more dosh, so at the beginning you can only choose between one of three characters, who cost $75 each. Beating the hell out of each enemy (in a very nice elf-like fashion, of course) gives you more coins, allowing you to hire tougher fighters for later bouts.

In two-player mode you can have a quick flick through the fighters and, well, I never knew that elves had such a varied racial culture. There's a sumo wrestling Japanelf, a vicious and contemptible sword wielding Turkelf and a king equipped with a fiendishly destructive mallet. These three constitute the toughest enemies, but because everyone is yours for a price, if you win enough bouts, you can hire these fighters later on in the game.

Okay, a cute beat 'em up might sound perverse, but Elfmania has managed to prove two things: 1.) Consoles are not the only place you can find decent beat 'em ups. 2.) You don't have to rip anyone's head off, have blood spouting everywhere and have special moves that are about as easy to execute as an American mass murderer to produce a top class, strategic and fun game. Very well done.</desc>

		<name>Elvira II : The Jaws of Cerberus</name>
		<desc>Elvira II: The Jaws of Cerberus is an adventure/RPG first-person game. You begin by choosing one of the four classes for your character (which determines your starting attributes, such as Strength, Intelligence etc.).

For movement, you click the arrows in the bottom-right corner of the screen. Collecting items can be done via clicking on them in the first-person view window and dragging them into your inventory. (You can also click the "room" icon to see all the items that you've found in the room so far.) Should you encounter monsters, you fight by clicking on them. You can choose one of the four tactics (Normal, Defense, Fierce, Berserk) when fighting, and there's a number of different weapons you can find in the game. If you meet someone who doesn't want to murder you (a very rare occurrence) you can talk to him, though conversations are pretty simple and consist mainly of short phrases.

As you defeat monsters, explore the game world and cast spells (see below), you get experience. Once you have enough experience, you gain a level, and your attributes improve.

Thanks to Elvira's spellbook she gave you, you have the ability to create and cast spells. Some spells can be used to heal yourself, protect you in combat or damage your enemies, other are necessary to solve certain puzzles and make progress in the game. Creating a spell requires you to be of high enough level and to have the proper ingredients, different for every spell. The ingredients are usually gone forever once the spell is ready, so beware and don't use up any items vital for completing the game! Casting a spell requires you to use some amount of Power Points (PP), which regenerate automatically but slowly. What's more, you only get a limited number of castings when you prepare a spell, so don't waste them.</desc>

		<desc>This strategic action puzzle game features original gameplay. You control a spacecraft situated on a globe which you can rotate and move around the screen. You must knock globes into others of the same colour, to rid the screen of all the globes. The screen has no borders, so globes can be pushed off the side of the screen, increasing your tactical range. Knocking globes of different colors into each other produces smaller pods which need to be picked up quickly, giving you energy, or they will turn into globes and you will have to get rid of them too. Many of the globes are linked to other globes (or the ship) via string, and the level layouts include barriers as obstacles (and ricochet points), making the Newtonian physics more complex.</desc>

		<desc>The sun is about to go supernova and humanity must find a new home. All the population is packed into a huge fleet of ships and they set off for a suitable planet. Unfortunately the route goes straight through the territory of a hostile alien race, the Rexxons. 

The game is a space shooter but you also get surface missions on different planets. The main emphasis on the game is the graphics which were excellent when the game was released but this meant that the game was very short with just 7 levels. There are loads of cutscenes all with music from Holst's planet suite.

		<name>Extase</name>
		<desc>The screen display in Extase depicts a symmetrical network of wires, some buttons, some fuses, some switches, and a picture of a female android in the middle. The overall aim is to restore sensory functions to the android, one in each level. All of this is done against an opponent, either human or computer, who controls the opposite half of the board.

This is done by guiding electrical pulses through each of the wires, however this can only be done once the wires have been woken up. You are in control of a cursor, which can click on the activation buttons to release a ball, which you direct using the cursor to reactivate wires on its path. Switches must be set to make all parts of this available  this can only be done when no ball is active.

Electrical sparks move around to make life harder, by destroying balls and fuses. Fortunately these can be 'zapped' using the cursor. New fuses can be generated by guiding a power beam into the fusebox, which is located centrally  simply pick up and place a generated fuse.

Better still, you can steal your opponent's, which is one of many ways the game becomes directly competitive. The two cursors cannot occupy the same space on screen, so hitting your opponent's cursor will jolt it. You can also adjust switches on both sides of the board, and summon sparks for your opponent to deal with. As the android is reactivated during the level it shows a range of facial expressions as a visual reward and measure of your progress.

		<desc>F1 is an Official Formula One Racing Game. There are two modes of play available: "Arcade", "Grand Prix". In both of these modes you complete a certain number of laps (4, 8, or 12) and select which circuit that you want to race on. The circuits include San Marino, France, Britain, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Japan, and Australia. Some circuits are easy, while some are difficult. 

There are slight differences between the two modes. For instance, "Arcade" allows you to select the circuit in any order that you like, whereas "Grand Prix" only allows you to fine-tune your car before starting a race. You also need to race a circuit in the order that they appear on the circuit selection screen, but you can skip a track if you want. 

F1 is a 1-2 player game, meaning that if you have another player handy, you can compete against each other.</desc>

You start off in a small coastal province, and must progress by meeting people and negotiating to get them on your side â sometimes the sword is mightier than the pen, sometimes not. You must ensure that the more militant locals are pacified, and that ethnic minorities are looked after.

While those sections are all strategic, there are also some vector-based combat sections. These ensure that brawns are required along with brains, and give the game some variety.</desc>

		<desc>Fate: Gates of Dawn is a first-person role-playing game with turn-based combat, similar in visual style and gameplay to Wizardry and Bard's Tale games. The player can recruit up to 28 characters, resulting in four parties that can be controlled separately. A notable feature of the game is a day/night cycle with weather effects that influence the behavior of the world's inhabitants. For example, less creatures will venture outside if it is raining; the player can choose to cast the Rain spell to reduce the number of hostile encounters.

There is a total of 32 different character classes in the game; many of them are traditional (like Wizard or Cleric), but there are also many exotic ones, such as for example Nymph, Banshee, Valkyrie, and others. Each class has abilities and spells associated with it. The world of the game is inhabited by eleven races, each with its own background history.</desc>

You job does not start at the racetrack; perfecting the car at the Maranello factory, in the wind tunnel to sort aerodynamics, and at the test track of Fiorano, is all required to get the most competitive car you can.

You can jump straight into the races however, either as one-offs or a full championship season. Races can last from 18km to the full 300+km distance, with all the practice and qualifying sessions. Car setup at the track involves selecting wing settings, tyre compounds, fuel usage (important in the days of turbocharged engines) and the like. The action is viewed from inside the cockpit, with rear-view mirrors to help prevent collisions.</desc>

But, with his last breath, he summons the Wizard Mage. The Demon King fearing defeat, escapes to the future. Tormented, the young samurai seeks the teachings of the Wizard Mage in the ways of magic. Boiled with revenge and armed with a magical sword, the young samurai follows the Demon King into the future and the unknown..."

The First Samurai is a platform action game very much similar to other platform games, but with a medieval oriental touch to it in addition to various unique features.

Arriving in the new unknown land, you are defenceless hence your fists and kicks. But as you journey forth, you'll find your trusty magical sword as well as throwing weapons such as knives and axes. With your martial art skills, your enemy best beware with those sudden moves that may prove fatal!

The First Samurai offers a wide array of weapons, special items and other objects. Combat is usually melee, either relying on your punch or kicks or using the magical sword to slash some pretty skillful blows in whatever direction possible.

Monsters are forever regenerating but food for health is plentiful. It actually takes an effort to be killed...

		<desc>Quiffy must collect all of the various pieces of litter on the level and then find the exit to complete each level. In general the litter is not particularly hidden, it is just distributed around the level. Quiffy can climb on most walls and ceilings, and swim through water. He has energy which depletes upon touching dangerous objects, but can also die instantly when touching any of the few lethal objects. Although he can swim and has the appearance of an amphibious life-form, he can only breathe above water and will start to drown if he runs out of air.

In each level, you are followed by the ghost of your Aunt Matilda. She copies your movements exactly and starts off about 15 seconds behind you. However, she is very slightly faster than you and will eventually catch up with you. Touching the ghost will hurt Quiffy.

Most of the levels have taps in them, which pour water in to the level. The modelling of the water was quite advanced for a home computer game of its time; the water will flow to the lowest point that it can and when multiple taps are pouring water in one place, it will fill up proportionally fast. A lot of levels feature taps in all areas so the entire level will eventually flood, leaving Quiffy with no available source of air. This aspect is how the game derives its title.</desc>

		<desc>Your homeland's precious limited energy is being taken advantage of by the evil Thargoid Empire, and you and your spaceship must do something about it. There are 8 bases to enter, with the aim of using energy pods to cause the reactors to overload and thus malfunction.

The game is viewed side-on, resembling the ST classic Oids quite strongly; which is to say that gravity and motion physics dictate the ship's motion strongly. The 8 levels all have plenty of enemies on offer, both wall-mountings and actual ships, as well as enhanced weapons and extra fuel and shield energy. The ship can take some damage, and repairs itself over time (for no logical reason), which is one of the few things that gives you a hope of getting anywhere early on. Losing a life causes all the enemy turrets to replenish, emphasizing the restart points and making things more maze-based and methodical.

		<name>Football Glory</name>
		<desc>Football Glory is a Sports game, developed by Croteam and published by Black Legend, which was released in Europe in 1994.

Football Glory is yet another average kickabout-in-the-park when compared to the Wembley Stadium of Sensible Soccer, but is no threat to serious threat to Sensi in the final reckoning. Overall, itÃ¢â¬â¢s not a bad game - trivial (but annoying) faults aside. There are plenty of options you can mess around with, competitions to enter your team in, and creating your own leagues and cups is always fun. And if you can persuade a mate or six to join you will find yourself playing along quite happily. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s just that when youÃ¢â¬â¢ve been playing Sensible World of Soccer all month, this along with almost every other football game, pales in comparison.

It plays an okay game of football, and I do like the overhead kick ability because it works very well. The speech, even it there is only one example of it is good as well. On the other hand, the aftertouch is absurd, the computer opponents can vary from stupid to world class during the same game and the special moves donÃ¢â¬â¢t ready work (mostly because you donÃ¢â¬â¢t have the chance to try for them before you lose possession of the ball).

Ah, well, never mind eh? A nice try, but in the end it just doesnÃ¢â¬â¢t have the right combination of options, new features or gameplay that it really should have to be number one.</desc>

		<name>Freedom : Rebels in the Darkness</name>
		<desc>Freedom: Rebels In The Darkness is a game that combines elements of strategy, stealth and fighting games. The main character is a rebellious black slave working on a sugar plantation that tries to incite a revolt among the slave population to gain freedom and to give comeuppance to each of their old masters.

At the start of the game there is four characters to choose, each with different statistics and abilities like "constitution" and "lock-picking". The main game screen is a map of the plantation, where you guide a small icon of the character while trying to avoid the guard dogs. If the dogs find you, they either bark and alert the owners or attack you. When they do, the screen switches to a first-person screen where you have to avoid being bitten and killed by the animal.

On the top of the screen there are four buttons, each with a unique function:
Path-finding lets you click on the map with a cursor and see a description of each hut and house.
Movement allows you to move your character. Left-clicking shows a first-person view of your surroundings. This screen can vary depending of the place where you are in the map. Most of the time is the recruitment screen, where you click on your brother slaves to amass a army. Their response is a random "yes" or "no". If you click while on a sugar field, you get the option of climbing the huts, picking the storage hut lock, or setting fire to the premises. If you click while on the housings of the owner or one of his henchmen, you get the option of either confronting the person, or running away. If you decide to confront him, the screen switches to a side-view similar to fighting games like Street Fighter, with two energy bars at the bottom, where you have to fight one of the owner's men. If you win, you have the choice of killing the person or holding him captive.
Review is the game statistics screen, where you can see your progress in the game.
Advice only starts working once you get the support of either the shaman or the medicine man. They can heal any wound sustained by dog attacks and fights.
The game accepts mouse, keyboard and joystick controls, and plays drum music and other sounds.</desc>

The game takes place on a huge island separated into eight regions: Desert, Lagoon, Forest, Pyramids, Mountains, Factory, Village, and finally the Castle.

For the US release, the title was changed to 'Pac-In-Time'. It's exactly the same game. Only the characters were changed : the not-so-known European Tinies (from the Skweek, Super Skweek, Tiny Skweeks/Brainies/Tinies games) were replaced by the widely known Pac-Man.

		<desc>When it comes to producing the fabled Ã¢â¬ËInteractive MovieÃ¢â¬â¢, all credit has so far gone to Cinemaware. On the other hand, American software house Sierra have been beavering away on their own style of interactive movies. Future Wars takes off from where Sierra apparently stopped. It is almost second generation in much the same vein.

You start off as a low window cleaner high up on the outside of a sky scraper. The introductory sequence shows him accidentally knocking his bucket over and taking a rollicking from his boss. Half-closing the window behind him the boss disappears back into the seclusion of his office, leaving you to ponder your next move. All the in-game orders are issued through a menu of just five commands to move the main character. Quite basic, but all the objects and puzzles are designed around that method making the game smoother to play.

There is a plot. The Earth has been under attack for many years now, but thanks to the SDI system sheÃ¢â¬â¢s held her own against the aliens. Two scientists discover that the aliens have gone back in time and landed in the year 1304. What this has to do with you is not made clear, so it leaves plenty of room for discovery.

Future Wars has some excellent animated sequences, gorgeous backdrops and a multitude of problems and characters to face. All backed up with sampled sound effects and the simple control method. A perfect game for the long winter months.</desc>

		<name>Fuzzball</name>
		<desc>A lot of creatures called fuzzballs, are released in an old wizards castle by his young apprentice. The young man is also turned into one of the fluffy creatures himself, by accident. The old wizard gets a little upset, and orders the apprentice to get rid of the fuzzballs swarming all over his castle. If he succeeds, the wizard will turn him back to human form again.

This is a platform game, with 50 levels. To complete each level, you'll have to collect all the treasures, while at the same time avoiding, or killing, various enemies. You will face mostly other fuzzballs, but also other creatures. Each level is only a single Bubble Bobblish screen, but can take a while to complete anyway.

Touching an enemy once means instant death, and if you don't complete a level in time, you will be killed by mosquitoes entering the screen. To succeed in Fuzzball, you'll have to plan every move carefully, otherwise you'll die very quickly.

		<desc>Three years have passed since Arthur defeated the Demon King Astaroth and rescued his beloved Princess Prin-Prin (see Ghosts 'N Goblins). A new villain, the Great Demon King Lucifer (Loki in some versions) has become the new leader of Ghoul Realm. While returning from a journey, Arthur sees the Princess' castle and her village under attack by Lucifer's forces. While rushing towards her beloved knight, the Princess is struck by one of Lucifer's laser beams.

Now, Arthur must venture back to the Lucifer's palace and destroy the demon in order to rescue the Princess' soul and bring her back to life! And it won't matter whether he fights in his shining armor or in his underwear alone...the bravest Knight in the land isn't going to be stopped by some monsters! Although the game starts with graveyard and marsh territory familiar from the first game, later levels are set in a tower, a mass of skeletons, and a castle.

Players progress from left to right (from bottom to top in level 3), and have to hack down the aforementioned monsters with a sword. The journey includes ledges, ladders, lava pits and slippery slopes. Different weapons can be collected, by finding suits of armor inside chests. Each of the five stages has its own setting and a final boss.</desc>

Gloom was written by New Zealand's respected Acid Software team, and published by Guildhall who supported the Amiga heavily in its later years. The emphasis was placed on action, rather than collecting keys and negotiating through maps.

If that's not enough for Jerrod sell everything and give his hometown Brooklyn a fond adieu, under the stamp was one of the first nuggets of Californian gold seen in the Atlantic shores of the United States. So, Jerrod bids farewell to his peaceful life as a newspaper editor, and becomes a fore-runner in the the great Gold Rush of 1849, hoping to find his brother and "strike gold" (literally). Released late into the lifespan of Sierra's AGI engine, Gold Rush! features some tricks not seen before the more advanced SCI engine, such as enlarged characters, but it is best known for the three routes available to reach California: by land, travel by boat to reach the Atlantic shore of Panama, cross the isthmus, and then get a second boat in the Pacific shore, or making the dangerous all-boat trip by Cape Horn. Each route has it's dangers: Cholera might strike as you make your way across the Northern states or your boat might sink.. As usual with Sierra adventures, instant killing happens if the player is careless, but will also happen at random. Other important (and innovative) concept is the game being timed. If Jerrod takes too long to leave Brooklyn, passages to California increase in price, and his house devalues.</desc>

		<name>Graham Taylor's Soccer Challenge</name>
		<desc>Graham TaylorÃ¢â¬â¢s Soccer Challenge is a Football Management game, developed and published by Krisalis Software, which was released in Europe in 1992.

Big sporting events are quite often responsible for the release of quite a few computer sports games. Krisalis havenÃ¢â¬â¢t missed the bandwagon either, with their Graham Taylor-licensed management game.

You are placed in the driving seat of a hopeful third-division side trying to break through to the higher divisions (and win one or two cup matches to boot). As well as the usual picking of team member and organising of training, you also have to do some nifty dealing to keep your side together.

Graham TaylorÃ¢â¬â¢s Soccer Challenge is a very slickly produced footy manager game, with more options and features than your usual management sim. Even though there is a lot of game content, the game still manages to offer a lot of smooth presentation to keep you interested. The match-day sections are well done, replacing the usual tiny, badly-animated sprites with some very nice-looking football.

Although the game is not exactly Player Manager, it is still a worthy attempt. If youÃ¢â¬â¢re a budding Graham Taylor, then this could have you plugging at the league for some time. Just remember to put three men up front when you are playing Sweden!</desc>

		<desc>Every five years the various races inhabiting the fantasy world of GHoLD meet for the Grand Monster Slam tournament to discover which is supreme. You must win a total of 9 matches to prove yourself, with two sub-games to negotiate (Revenge of the Beloms and Faulton Feeding - fortunately these can be practiced from the main menu) as well.

The basic game sees you and your opponent start with a row of six Beloms (small round creatures) which must be kicked across the pitch quickly enough to leave your opponent with all 12 at his end. When this happens you can run to his end to win. The main things to avoid during the match are being hit by a shot and kicking one into the crowd. When hit you lose time recovering, and are penalised with a Pelvan, which can cost you up to 3 Beloms, by hitting the crowd.

After every third match you must play the Faulton Feeding game, which involves aiming at six progressively-higher poles to hit the Faulton creature with the food - fail to get enough of these and you must replay the previous match. After other games you play the Revenge of the Beloms game, in which Beloms hurtle towards you and must be deflected away with your pole - failure to clear enough before one hits you reduces your score from the previous match.

The single player part of the game consists of a total of 49 mazes. After each five successfully finished levels you will receive a password that allows you to choose the corresponding level as starting point in the main menu. The ten highest scores achieved will be permanently saved on disk.

There are three other game modes available: Race, Two Pilot Race and Dogfight.
In Race mode you can choose one of 10 available tracks and try to achieve best times. You'll have to avoid obstacles similar to the one found single player mission mode, a crash means that the race is over. If you succeed in achieving a track record it will be saved permanently also.
Two Pilot Race offers three different tracks. The screen is splitted into two parts. Your only task is to reach the finish line before your opponent. If you crash you'll be respawned at the starting point.
Dogfight offers two tracks where you can fight against another player. The player which lost all lives first is the looser.

Greens: The Ultimate 3-D Golf Simulation is full of options. A dozen game types can be played on six different courses by up to four human players. A handicap system is included to allow novices and experts to play together. In one player mode the 'ranking list' allows players to play head-to-head against computer opponents of varying skill and rise in the ranks.

Hitting the ball is done using same control system pioneered in Leaderboard and used in most golf games. First click on the mouse button starts the back swing, second sets the force and final click sets the snap.

Greens: The Ultimate 3-D Golf Simulation is a great golf simulation for the Amiga. Its system requirements are modest meaning even A500 owners will be able to play it properly. Like other golf sims it's appeal is limited to fans of this genre, but for those looking for a good, challenging sports simulation, they could do much worse than selecting this golf game from the flight simulation experts.</desc>

		<desc>Hard Drivin' is a 3D arcade hit from Atari Games. You are in control of a high-performance sports car. Your objective is to race around the course as fast as possible and hit as many checkpoints as possible. If you hit a checkpoint you gain extra time to go farther. You will see traffic on the road both in your direction and coming down the opposite direction, so be careful when you pass... 

The course has two sections: speed track, and stunt track. Speed track is longer, but you can usually achieve higher speeds. Stunt track requires you to perform several stunts such as jumping bridges, driving through a loop, and so on. 

Crashing the car has no serious consequences and indeed shows a replay of your crash from a cinematic angle. Admire your crash head-on into the cement truck, or clipping the minivan, or flying off the bridge in the wrong angle... You lose several seconds as your car is "reset" and you get up to speed again. 

The home conversions retain most of the then-advanced 3D graphics but lack the force-feedback that was in the arcade version.

He does this by firing hearts of love at them, as contact with any of them is fatal. The gameplay is platform-based, with lots of vertical ascents to be made, and features lots of bonuses and hidden sections.

		<name>Heart of China</name>
		<desc>Heart of China from Dynamix is the second adventure game from the company which is probably better known for flight sims like A10 Tank Killer and the infamous Red Baron. It puts the player into the boots of Ã¢â¬ËLuckyÃ¢â¬â¢ Jake Masters, an all-American hero who gets a mission to save a  rich manÃ¢â¬â¢s kidnapped daughter from the hands of the local villain. It is a pointÃ¢â¬â¢nÃ¢â¬â¢click adventure game which merges a good story with beautiful graphics and stunning music.

Heart of China (HoC) has the same control system Dynamix pioneered in Rise of The Dragon (their first adventure game). HoC can be played either with mouse, keyboard or even with joystick. Only a few actions are available (look, operate, move) but this is supported with some clever inventory manipulation. Most of the scenes are viewed from a first person perspective through your characterÃ¢â¬â¢s eyes. The first person view means the locations and characters are usually presented with static hand drawn pictures with odd animation sequence here and there. The Amiga version has 32 colour graphics which, despite the low number of colours, manage to look clear and beautiful.

The interactive storyline in Heart of China is not linear - meaning there are several ways to  solve problems and that player actions affect the flow and the direction of the adventure. This also means there are several entirely different endings.

ThereÃ¢â¬â¢s very little to fault in this game. Some players might be put off by the fact that unlike in LucasArts adventures, the main character can die or the adventure can otherwise run into a dead end. The control system takes some learning. Also the arcade parts might annoy the adventure game purists.

Without doubt one of the finest adventure games on the Amiga. Heart of China combines quality graphics and sound with a funny and interesting storyline. It contains unique features like plot branches, a totally original control system and deep character interaction. Like Ã¢â¬ËLuckyÃ¢â¬â¢ Jake Masters likes to think about himself, this one is an Ace.</desc>

You take control of a wizard, a dwarf, a barbarian and an elf, each with different strengths and weaknesses, who each start the 14 missions from opposite sides of the board.

Strict turn-based movement rules apply, as actions other than movement can only be carried out before or after the move, the size of which is limited by a dice roll. These moves are carried out using an icon-based system. Characters can fight the many monsters which lurk, or cast spells to vanquish them. There are magic potions to uncover, but also hidden traps, so mapping is advised. Treasure can be collected, and traded at the shop after each level.

		<name>Hero's Quest : So You Want To Be A Hero</name>
		<desc>So you want to be a hero? Then just pop into the AdventurerÃ¢â¬â¢s Guild, and study the notice board. There you will find offers of both honours and rewards, providing you are prepared to venture into the forest of Spielburg and risk all.

Played in the usual Sierra adventure-style mode, HeroÃ¢â¬â¢s Quest is classified as a Role Playing Game, but it has all the characteristics of an adventure as well as an RPG. 
Before commencing, a character must be set up. YouÃ¢â¬â¢re offered a choice of Fighter, Magic User, and Thief as your personna.

The play progresses very much along the lines of a Sierra-style adventure, with just a little more emphasis on the acquisition of scrolls, potions, and weaponry. Until you meet up with something nasty in the forest, that is.
 
Fighting can be exhausting work, and you will need a few pieces of silver for a good nightÃ¢â¬â¢s rest, not to mention the odd spell or two that you are short of! Make sure you never fail to search your victimÃ¢â¬â¢s body after his demise, for he may be carrying a fortune on his person!

Sound effects and music accompany many of the scenes and animated sequences. Most are a delight, and the animation is often quite humorous.
 
Because of the different character settings that can be achieved, together with random events, HeroÃ¢â¬â¢s Quest is unlikely to play the same way twice over. And fighting will take on a whole new dimension if you can throw a few nasty spells at your opponent rather than simply beating it to death!

Coming on five disks for the 1 Meg Amiga, HeroÃ¢â¬â¢s Quest is yet another high quality game from Sierra that is certain to give hours of fun and enjoyment.</desc>

		<name>Hired Guns</name>
		<desc>Hired Guns is an action/adventure/RPG hybrid using square-based movements, à la Dungeon Master, in which up to four players can take part and set in a futuristic setting. The screen is split into 4 parts (or 3 in case 3 players play together), each one representing the viewpoint of the characters, these being selected from a team of 12 available mercenaries.

If one player plays alone, he will control all 4 characters, using the mouse to navigate between each character viewpoints. A follow mode is available to avoid tedious numerous amounts of clicking when moving several characters. If two players play together, then each player will use a mouse to control two characters.

In three or four-player mode, players can freely choose to control their characters via either a joystick/joypad or some of the predefined keyboard layouts or a mouse. When 4 people play together, the screen will display 4 viewpoints, like in 1 and 2-player modes. In 3-player mode, the top of the screen displays two viewpoints for player 1 and 2, but the lower part of the screen displays a single viewpoint, centered, for player 3.

Three game modes are available.
The Training mode features 5 simple maps on which the player(s) can learn how to move, use inventory items etc...

The Full Campaign mode takes the player(s) to the far reaches of the Luyten planetary system, on the planet Graveyard. Battling through more than 20 theaters of engagement, your team of mercenaries test their limits of military prowess in order to wipe out all threats on the planet surface. To this end, they have to make their way through the different missions and gather 4 fusion power core rings, before entering the final mission in the Spaceport.

Finally, in Short Action game mode, the player(s) can choose between 17 maps. On those maps, the player(s) will have to fight some enemies to reach the exit within a specified time limit. Additionally, when more than one player takes part in the mission, players will compete with each other since only the first to reach the exit will win.

Both players act simultaneously on a split screen. While one player can move his units, the other can attack and vice versa. The results of battles are shown in animated sequences.

Terrain affects the performance of units, and seasons affect the likely terrain. Different units are introduced as the game and war progress, with more air and sea battles later on.

There are 24 single-player maps in the game, which can be played from either the German or French perspective. In addition, there are 12  two-player maps.

The game also includes a lot of information about the period: after each mission, historical facts about two months of wartime are displayed.

It's a point and click adventure, and the pirate setting ensures that it recalls the Monkey Island games. The top 2/3 of the screen features a visual depiction of the area Peter is in, which a row of icons along the bottom can be selected to alter the function of a mouse click. These include looking at an object, picking it up, talking to people, using objects to solve problems (often in combination with others), and giving objects to others.

		<desc>Why do they bother? Companies trying to do Ã¢â¬ËscaryÃ¢â¬â¢ horror games. I mean They sure as hell donÃ¢â¬â¢t scare anybody and nine times out of ten theyÃ¢â¬â¢re decidedly mediocre anyway. This is certainly true of the awesomely below-average Horror Zombies from the Crypt, a game that supposedly pays homage to the classic horror flicks of yesteryear. In it you play a hapless hero who stumbles into a creepy mansion in the dead of night (oh yes, because that sort of thing happens all the time) and then has to try and escape. 

Naturally this unlikely scenario manifests itself into a scrolling arcade adventure with the baddies all extras from various generic cinematic shockers. YouÃ¢â¬â¢ve got zombies, vampires, frankensteins stumbling about after youÃ¢â¬Â¦ itÃ¢â¬â¢s all quite predictable really. The basic object is to avoid these meanies (or, better yet, kill them with your throwing knives), explore the various levels, collect keys and objects, unlock doors... you know the sort of thing. There are some vague platform elements - many items of furniture can be climbed and jumped on, and in some cases moved about.

If anything, Horror Zombies is best compared to something like The Addams Family - although this canÃ¢â¬â¢t dare to hold a candle to OceanÃ¢â¬â¢s classic platformer. Here the action is stunted, slow and unexciting. ThereÃ¢â¬â¢s very little to hold your attention, and the rather gratuitous death sequence (your head blows up unconvincingly), little effort has gone into trying to make the game anything like the horror movies itÃ¢â¬â¢s supposed to be a tribute to. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s not totally unplayable, but it lacks imagination, hasnÃ¢â¬â¢t been very well put together and as a result comes across as one of the most mediocre games weÃ¢â¬â¢ve seen in a good few months. Buy something else instead.</desc>

Fully 3D, you have the choice to go anywhere you please during any mission. A focus is put on freedom of choice; there's no one way to complete a mission. You can take control of any vehicle in the game, and these range from riding pedal bikes and windsurfing, to vans and ambulances, to tanks and armoured cars, to battleships and helicopters. Your arsenal includes grenades, explosives, various gadgets and a handgun, though deadlier weapons are mounted on some of the vehicles. Or if you prefer, you can acquire an enemy uniform and sneak in rather than blast your way through.

There are also many structures to be found, many containing regular citizens who may be interacted with (talking to them, bribing them...), though there are also more specialised structures which may contain vehicles, ammo, or anything you might find useful to your mission.</desc>

Each of the moves scores a different number of points and if you come last in a particular round you are eliminated.

There are some sub-games too, involving your karate-master holding a shield and defending himself against bouncing balls from both directions, and kicking bombs off the screen before they explode.

All in the pursuit of that elusive black belt...</desc>

		<desc>Being an action title, the game starts off where Indy is about to have an excuse to use his trusty whip: in Monte Carlo, after he recruited headstrong former student Sophie to his aid and determined the location of ancient discs needed to open the door to the lost city of Atlantis. Most action takes place in isometric view, although there are some variations along the way to keep up interest. There are even some adventure-game elements, such as Indy's inventory which you can fill with various objects to use (i.e. money to buy things). They are mostly easy though, and are there only to relieve the tension from knuckle-blistering action.</desc>

		<name>Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis</name>
		<desc>Indiana Jones is back! The great archaeologist and adventurer has to solve a grand mystery once again, aided by his trusty whip, his sharp wit, and his courage. A man who calls himself Mr. Smith is interested in a certain ancient statue. When the unsuspecting Indy hands it over to the client, he finds out that Mr. Smith is in fact a colonel in the Nazi army! Why was he so interested in that statue? A girl who had once worked together with Indy, the pretty red-haired (and a bit troublesome) Sophia, tells him the whole thing must have a connection with the legendary lost continent Atlantis. Gathering clues from all over the world, Indy and Sophia embark on their greatest journey!

Fate of Atlantis is not a movie spin-off, but an independent adventure with a brand new story. The gameplay utilizes LucasArts' famous SCUMM system, with action verbs the player chooses from a menu; the objects that can be interacted with are highlighted. The game contains many puzzles of various kinds (mostly inventory-based) and dialogues with multiple choices. There are also a couple of hand-to-hand fights against the Nazis. The middle part of the game can be played in three "modes": co-operation (Indy and Sophia), adventure (Indy alone), and action (Indy alone, with less puzzles and more action). In each mode there are different locations to visit, different puzzles to solve, and different characters to meet.

		<name>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade : The Graphic A</name>
		<desc>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure is a graphic adventure game, originally released in 1989 (to coincide with the release of the film of the same name), published by Lucasfilm Games (now LucasArts). It was the third game to use the SCUMM engine.

The plot closely follows, and expands upon, the film of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. As the game begins, Indiana Jones has returned to his college, after reclaiming the Cross of Coronado. He is approached by businessman Walter Donovan, who tells him about the Holy Grail, and of the disappearance of Indy's father.

Indy then travels to some of the places seen in the movie, such as Venice and the catacombs, after meeting fellow archeologist Elsa Schneider. In the process he finds his father held captive in the Brunwald Castle, after passing through the mazelike corridors, fighting and avoiding guards. Then Elsa's double role is revealed when she steals the Grail Diary from Indy. After escaping, father and son pass through Berlin to reclaim the Diary and have a brief meeting with Hitler. Then they reach an airport, from where they intend to seek the Valley of the Crescent Moon, by Zeppelin or biplane. There are many action scenes, involving fists, and the biplane sequence above Europe, pursued by Nazi planes.

Several key elements of the movieÃ¢â¬âsuch as the Brotherhood of the Grail, Indy's friend Sallah, and the Venice water chase and the desert battle scenes (except for small hidden references)Ã¢â¬âwere not included in the game.

Last Crusade was one of the most innovative of the LucasArts adventures. It expanded on LucasArts' traditional adventure game structure by including a flexible point system - the IQ score, or "Indy Quotient" - and by allowing the game to be completed in several different ways. The point system was similar to that of Sierra's adventure games, however when the game was restarted or restored, the total IQ of your previous game was retained. The only way to reach the maximum IQ of 800 was by finding alternative solutions to puzzles, such as fighting a guard instead of avoiding him. This countered one common criticism of adventures games, whereby since there is only one way to finish the game, they have no replay value. Some of the alternative fights, such as the one with the Zeppelin attendant, were very difficult to pass, so the maximum IQ was very difficult to acquire.

The game was released in May 1989 simultaneously with the movie. It was available for DOS, Amiga, Atari ST, and Mac OS. A CD-ROM version was later released for the FM-Towns, with 256-color graphics, as well as a VGA PC version. The player has to enter copy protection codes similar to those of Maniac Mansion and Zak McKracken at the start of the game. If the wrong codes are entered three times, the game goes into "demo" mode. When Indy is asked by Walter Donovan to translate the tablet, he makes a hilarious mistranslation, causing Donovan to throw him outside, ending the game. The 256-color versions of the game do not have the copy protection codes.

A replica of Henry Jones' Grail diary was included with earlier versions of the game. While very different from the film's version, it provided a collection of background information of Indy's youth and Henry's life. Later versions of the game came with a shortened version of the Grail diary. The diary gave Indy's mother's name as Mary, which was contradicted by subsequent canon.

Last Crusade was also the first Lucasfilm game to include the verbs Look and Talk. In several situations, the latter would begin a primitive dialogue system in which the player could choose one of several lines to say. The system was fully evolved in The Secret of Monkey Island and remained in all later LucasArts adventures, with the exception of Loom.

Many of the scenes unique to the game were conceived by George Lucas and Steven Spielberg during the creation of the movie</desc>

Mine level: Whip your way through a mine in order to free children that are held captive. Use your whip to swing across chasms, climb ladders, ride along conveyor belts and defend yourself against attacks from Thuggee guards, bats, snakes and the fireball-throwing Mola ram. Escape with the mine cart after you've freed all children.
    
Mine cart level: Pick the right route through a network of tracks while riding in a mine cart. Avoid potholes, broken tracks &amp; guards in carts and safely reach the end of the track.
    
Temple level: Make your way to the altar and grab the Sankara stone while Mola Ram, bats and Thuggee guards attack you. Watch out for that lava.</desc>

		<name>Indianapolis 500 : The Simulation</name>
		<desc>Indianapolis 500: The Simulation is a 1989 computer game. It was hailed as the first step of differentiating racing games from the arcade realm and into racing simulation.[1] It was developed by the Papyrus Design Group, consisting of David Kaemmer and Omar Khudari,[2] and distributed by Electronic Arts. It first released for DOS and later for the Amiga in 1990.

Indianapolis 500: The Simulation attempts to be a full simulation of the Indianapolis 500 race, with 33 cars and appropriate Indy car "feel". While racing, it only offers a first-person perspective, but the game offers a replay mode as well. Indy 500 offers the ability to realistically set up the car, and any changes made to the car directly affect how it handles.

The field is represented as realistic and the qualifying order stays true to the 1989 Indianapolis 500 starting grid, with one exception: the player's car, numbered 17, replaces Car #29 of Rich Vogler, who qualified in 33rd and last place.</desc>

The game is viewed in 3D from Solar's perspective, with a full HUD built into his helmet showing direction, health and supplies. Other HUDs also allow you to check whether the current air is breathable (you have limited oxygen), as well as one built into your Jetpack.

There are two movement modes, one of which allows you to pan the view and the other allows you to shoot. Objects have to be picked up and used, computers operated, and an infra-red kit located and used. To win the game you will have to destroy all the eggs, and then shut the compound down and escape in time.

Jack T. Ladd is a thief, his hunting-ground is the whole galaxy, and at the moment, he's in big trouble. He's got 28 days to pay his taxes - or else the interstellar tax agency will hunt him down. Termination is a viable punishment for tax offenders in these days, you know. Stranded blank on the barren, run-down planet Tayte, Jack decides that he has to make some cash. Quick.

Innocent Until Caught is pretty standard in terms of design but introduces some innovations when it comes to the interface. It features a mini-window at the bottom left of the screen which is alternately a mini-map of the area (showing all exits) and a looking glass for detecting small items. The inventory is a box-window in which objects can be placed wherever player wants (even on top of others). Also, the plot is illustrated by a few rendered sequences, some of the first used in adventure games.</desc>

		<desc>A International sports challenge rghhh! Just as the dust was clearing after the stampede of footy games, it is time for the Olympics and the inevitable onslaught of athletics games. Lucky for Empire, their International Sports Challenge has two things going for it Ã¢â¬â it is the first one out, and it has got some weird events in it. Sure it has got the usual dose of joystick waggling (in the swimming and cycling events), but among the six events (okay, so it is not exactly a full Olympic sim) are show jumping, and Ã¢â¬â yes! Ã¢â¬â skeet shooting Ã¢â¬â always one of my faves on the sports games of yesteryear.

It is possible to play each event individually, but of course these games are all about doing the entire thing, preferably competing against a friend of two. The formula for the whole lot goes something like this Ã¢â¬â diving, shooting, cycling, swimming and show jumping are all played as in-between events, with a strategy- based marathon even enveloping them all. This marathon does not require a single joystick waggle, instead requiring players to balance rhythm with speed, top-up energy, avoid dehydration, all that kind of stuff.

The lack of events is partially compensated for by the gameÃ¢â¬â¢s flexibility, with several variations in each event upping lastability and game time. Empire reckon there are 2000 event variations to try out, and while I doubt you would want to try out every single combination, International Sports Challenge offers a decent amount of fun for yer money, for a team of players at least. I have got my doubts about its value as a single player game though, and the water events really are tedious. But at least it tries to be a little different, and anyway, I am a sucker for multiplayer games.</desc>

		<name>Ishar - Legend of the Fortress</name>
		<desc>The first game in the series came out in 1992 on Amiga, Atari ST and DOS. It takes place on the island of Kendoria. At the beginning, the player controls a warrior called Aramir, and he must defeat Krogh, an evil sorcerer who has killed lord Jarel. The game takes its name from Krogh's fortress, Ishar, whose name means "unknown" in the game's fictional elf language. In order to achieve this, the player's characters must travel across the whole island and, among other things, meet with the surviving companions of Jarel.

Most of Ishar takes place in an outdoor environment, which was original for computer roleplaying games of the time. It also featured a unique system to change the lineup of player characters: the player can have up to five characters at the same time, but each one will like or dislike his comrades. These preferences come into play when the player tries to recruit or dismiss a character, because the other characters will then vote for or against the recruitment or dismissal. If a character cannot be dismissed by a vote, it is possible for the player to have him assassinated by another character, but there is a risk that other characters will murder the murderer himself, possibly creating a chain of murders that slays the whole party but one.

This opus was the only one of the series that had gold removed from the party each time the player saved.

The band Summoning used the cover art of the game for their album Minas Morgul.</desc>

		<desc>The sequel to Ã¢â¬ËIshar: Legend Of the FortressÃ¢â¬â¢ takes up the story long after the destruction of Krogh, by Aramir and his companions - including KroghÃ¢â¬â¢s own mother, the witch Morgula! The former Fortress of Ishar became the new growth epicentre for the Aborean archipelago - The Isle of Kendoria and diverse islands named after JarelÃ¢â¬â¢s companions where another evil lord arose - Shandar. Zubaran, IsharÃ¢â¬â¢s current Ruler,  hears of this. So, naturally, Shandar must be found and destroyed. This is the ultimate object of the game.

The SilmarilsÃ¢â¬â¢ standard of graphics and gameplay is sustained, and in parts improved upon, in this evolved creation of a larger and more involved fantasy world. Additions to this game include the introduction of topography. There is a greater variety of characters and creatures and everything is, again, nicely drawn, but the animation remains Ã¢â¬ËstaticÃ¢â¬â¢.

You start out alone, broke etc., but you have the option of using your team from Ã¢â¬ËIshar 1Ã¢â¬â¢. There is a map in this game which, unlike its predecessor, actually shows your position, plus indications of places to go/avoid. This sequel does rely more heavily on precursive tasks, and, unfortunately in this way, does tend towards the linear - but, not in an obvious, precognitive, or boring, way.

Overall? Quite a romp! Escapist adventure, or what?! Less uneventful/aimless wandering than either predecessor, but you need an eagle-eye to pick up on some things, even from the start. Difficulty level?  Not novice, you need a bit of experience.  Not as dull/predictable/frustrating/unimaginative as one or two other RPGs I could mention. Have fun!</desc>

		<name>Ishar 3 - The Seven Gates of Infinity</name>
		<desc>It does not matter whether you are a paragon of saintly goodness or the personification of demonically malignant evil. If you crave security, you need some form of insurance policy. Especially if you happen to be in the business of malicious wizardry and have set your twisted mind on getting the fair of people of the mightiest kingdom in Ishar under your ghastly thrall. Shandar, the malevolent sorcerer anti-hero of the piece, was defeated and banished but he took out an insurance policy in the shape of a third party planetary fire and conjunction clause. Yes, as soon as two of the moons, the sun and the planet Ishar align, Shandar can cash in his policy and transfer his spirit to the body of a Black Dragon with a name that sounds like Weetabix. Of course, this horrible scenario can be thwarted if you turn up at the right place and time Ã¢â¬â time travel features heavily throughout the game. Seven different eras and key plot points await visitation.

The engine driving the game is the same as the previous two Ishars - lots of mouse clicks and traipsing around to gain money, arms, armour, spells, character interaction, combat and stuff.

Gripes aside, Ishar 3 is still recommended. Especially if you are a fan of either of the previous incarnations. The same criticism applies to the actual mechanics of the gameplay Ã¢â¬â most of your time is spent traipsing around looking for fights to gain money before you can access the meat of the game in the form of puzzle solving and evil monster beating. But, if that is the sort of thing you like, then Ishar 3 delivers brilliantly. Final verdict: A miasmic mish mash of apocryphal Tolkiesm, cut and paste plagiarism, hack and slash institutionalism and engagingly evil endeavours.</desc>

Coming first is recommended but the only requirement for staying in the championship is that you complete the fifth lap ahead of any other computer-controlled car (and that includes Iron Man Ivan himself).

Presentation of the game is really good: Three-player mode, attractive start-up screens, select a country option (complete with anthems). Multiload for each track but it's not excessive. Great attention to graphics detail in the relatively small trucks and their movement with plenty of frames of animation, great dirt shading and excellent detail in the extra effects. A jolly variety of suitably fast paced tunes (different one for each course) together with good samples. Separate country anthems, title and trophy screen tunes.

Overall, a highly playable Super Sprint variant, proving great fun with the multiplayers option, high quality graphics and excellent attention to detail.</desc>

		<name>Jaguar XJ220</name>
		<desc>In the early nineties, the Jaguar XJ220 was the fastest serial-produced car ever. Core Design acquired the right to build a game around it, in a move to counter Gremlin's immensely successful Lotus series.

Just like Lotus, Jaguar XJ200 is a view from behind racer. There are 32 tracks all over the world, with varying road conditions and animated weather conditions such as rain and fog in England, snow in Switzerland, and tumbleweed crossing the street in Egypt. You race your Jaguar in a constructor grand prix, with opponents running for Porsche, Ferrari and other famous makers. Between races, you must mend the damage your car has sustained, which eats up your prize money. Background music is selected through a dashboard CD player, which also features some rather uninspiring radio stations.

The game can also be played in a two-player split-screen mode and features a track editor for when you tire of the built-in courses.

The gameplay takes place across worlds themed around particular types of toys, such as sporting goods, candy and aircraft.

The game starts just after the T-Rex pushes the visitor's van into it's pit. You play the role of Dr. Alan Grant, so you have to find Tim and Lex, take them to the Visitor's center and get everybody out of the island. But this time it won't be half as easy as it was on the movie.

The game is split in two missions, played in two different ways. The first mission is to take Tim and Lex back to their grandfather and is (almost exclusively) played from a top-down perspective. The second mission involves getting the power back on line and returning alive, so everybody can leave the island and is played like a FPS (First Person Shooter).

Each player on the pitch has a unique combination of 4 attributes, namely Pace, Stamina, Accuracy and Aggression. As you progress you will need to adapt to to different types of players. You can play in a league consisting of 8 teams. The teams in the league are on the whole evenly matched but have different styles of play with players attribute to match that style.

The game now features full tournament modes (although the players on the teams are fictitious) and four different pitches (including an implementation of plastic pitches, whose uneven bounce cause controversy when several British clubs tried them in the 1980s).

Viewed top-down, the controls involve trapping the ball under your foot, giving you time to prepare passes. Running with the ball is tricky at first, as it doesn't stick to your foot the way it did in contemporary football games. Complex moves such as overhead kicks, back-heels and long-range through-ball passes can be completed with practice.

		<name>Kid Chaos</name>
		<desc>Kid Chaos is transported from the stone age into an unknown world by evil scientists from the future. Now he must fight his way through artificial environments such as the Secret Garden, Toxic Wasteland, Toy Factory, Techno Fortress, and the Ruined City to reach the time machine that can transport him back home.

Kid does this by running through the level, destroying all wildlife and several destruction targets, then leave the level by the exit door, which remain closed until Kid has destroyed all destruction targets. He destroys by swinging his club in the air and hitting them. He can also whiz if he's running fast, which enable him to discover hidden passages through walls that usually contain apples and power-ups. These are also found if Kid manages to jump really high in the air and lands on a platform that usually lead to secret passages.

There are five levels and four sections to complete in all of them (a total of twenty levels) and Kid start each level with three lives. During the level, if he loses health just by touching wildlife, or if the time expires, he is warped out of the level, loses a life, and has to restart the level at the checkpoints he passes through. His health can be restored either by waiting for the health meter to reach 99 (the boring way) or collecting apples (the smart way), but as Kid progresses further throughout the game, these apples become rare as well as his destruction targets. 

Once he leaves a level, Kid is given a statistics screen, telling him the percentage of destruction he has caused, how much wildlife he has killed, how many apples he collected, and other extras. These "extras" probably include how much more of his destruction targets he broke beyond the requirement.

As mentioned earlier, if Kid jumps really high to reach a platform, he can get power-ups, giving him such wonderful things like extra lives, extra time, or extra health. He can also collect a life token. If he manages to find three life tokens within the same section, then he is awarded an extra life as well.

Every fourth level, Kid will be faced with a challenge, and the object of these is usually to kill something, but there's always a catch for these challenges. For example, in Toy Factory, he has to shoot teddy bears at least ten times to blow them up, while avoiding shooting at ducks; and in Techno Fortress, he's presented with a game similar to Space Invaders, but only this time, there are no barriers. 

Kid Chaos starts off easily, but the further he progresses in the game, the higher the damage factor. Early in the game, he is allowed to hit so much wildlife before he loses a life, but as he progresses through each level, he can't afford to be hit not even once. Some levels in the game are quite tricky. Some levels require him to race through the level under a very strict time limit, while others contain a huge destruction target and he can't afford to miss any of these targets.

The game uses a password system, that allows you to resume at the start of each level. In terms of the gameplay, one of the cheats say it all.

The levels feature an assortment of enemies to kill, including snakes, elves and crocodiles, as well as flames and spinning wheels. Many of these appear during the level, forcing you to plan for them. You have 10 lives, but the loss of one resets the level to its original state. The initial coin-throwing is pretty weedy, but better weapons (as well as extra lives and smart bombs) can be bought in the shop, which appears every 5 screens.

The levels are flick-screen, and can usually be finished in different ways, which results in different starting positions on the next screen, and you can travel back and forth through them, for example to pick up bonuses which are visible but not accessible as the level starts.</desc>

		<desc>As a knight, paladin, barbarian or sorceress, amass an army of creatures to take on the local baddies and search for the Sceptre of Order.  A turn based game with a time limit that decreases depending on the skill level you play at.

Depending on your allegiance, you will initially start with a different set of creatures, though the king will not mind whether you're his knight or barbarian. Game consists of four maps, each with more mean creatures to control and meaner opponents to fight, but acquiring those maps early will let you find and buy some mean creatures that will help you easily conquer prior maps.

You can see all the enemies on the map and can literally clear the map of enemies, though random can appear in your castles if you leave them unprotected after the conquest. With each conquered castle (assuming the castle is occupied by the enemy you are currently after), you will get a level up, after first two level-ups king will promote you and you'll be able to recruit cavalries from the castle, after four more promotions you'll be able to recruit knights. All the other creatures are found outside the king's castle and can be recruited no matter the level, although your level determines the quantity of creatures you can find for recruitment, but take care of your money because if you don't have enough for your army's salary, they will desert or turn against you.

There are also two artifacts per each map that will also uncover the map of the place holding the King's Sceptre. The moment you find the sceptre and bring it back to the king, the game will end even if you happen to find it very early in the game.

As for tougher enemies, like the final one having hundreds of dragons and demons, they can also be defeated, but not by the army you can muster in one go. But when you're defeated, you respawn back at the king's castle and start with almost nothing but your money, however, the enemy in the castle will be left without those creatures lost in the battle, unless some of the new comes to aid him as every week the population increases.

		<desc>After having recovered the three treasures, King Graham has been crowned king. Now having needing a queen for companionship, Graham searches the land for a maiden, but to no avail, so he turns to the magic mirror for help. The mirror shows him a beautiful girl locked away in a quartz tower in a faraway land of Kolyma, and must find three keys that are used to unlock the door that will lead to her. 



King's Quest II: Romancing the Throne is a graphic adventure game. As is typical for Sierra's AGI games, players move Graham around with arrow keys and perform actions by typing commands in the interface, which are usually combination of verbs and nouns. The game is similar to its predecessor in structure and gameplay system. Like Daventry, Kolyma is a large cyclical world consisting of interconnected screens. Compared to the first game, it is bigger and busier, with more locations and places of interest. Puzzles follow a similar format; knowledge of fairy tales is advisable for solving some of them, and complex solutions grant the player more points than a brute force approach possible in some cases.</desc>

		<name>King's Quest III : To Heir is Human</name>
		<desc>King Graham and Queen Valanice had two children, Alexander and Rosella, and the kingdom was once peaceful. It wasn't long until Alexander was snatched from his crib and things started to take a turn for the worse. A three-headed dragon threatens the ever-peaceful Daventry, and requires a maiden to be sacrificed every year. Rosella is the chosen one.



Meanwhile, in a secluded house atop a mountain in the land of Llewdor, the evil wizard called Manannan keeps a young lad named Gwydion as his slave, forcing him to do menial tasks as he prepares his spells and observes the country through his telescope. Gwydion must find a way to outsmart the wizard, escape, and eventually discover the truth about his own identity.



King's Quest III: To Heir is Human is an adventure game similar in basic gameplay mechanics to its predecessor The player navigates Gwydion with arrow keys and interacts with the environment by typing verb and noun combination commands. Llewdor consists of interconnected screens that loop once the player character reaches the border of the land. Throughout the course of the game, Gwydion will also travel to other locations and have a magic map at his disposal, allowing him to teleport to different areas. 



There are more items to collect in this installment, and more complex actions required to execute, raising the difficulty level. A large part of the game proceeds in real time, with Mannanan following his own schedule, forcing the player to plan and time his actions. There is also a time limit imposed on the game's first major quest.</desc>

		<name>King's Quest IV : The Perils of Rosella</name>
		<desc>King Graham and Queen Valanice were glad to have their children back. Graham thinks that it is time to pass onto them his old adventurers' hat. When he throws it across the room, he suffers a heart attack and collapses on the floor, and he is carried off to bed. The only way that Graham's health can be restored is by retrieving the magic fruit in the faraway land of Tamir. A beautiful fairy called Genesta offers Rosella the chance to be transported to the land, and find the fruit. But once she gets transported, she cannot be sent back unless she helps the fairy regain her talisman that was stolen by the evil witch, Lolotte. 



King's Quest IV: The Perils of Rosella is the first game in the series to have a female protagonist. Rosella will meet characters that will either help or hinder her. The player moves Rosella around with arrow keys, and have her perform actions by typing commands. Unlike the previous King's Quest games, which used the AGI engine, this installment uses the new SCI engine with more detailed graphics; the most visible effect is that the game is paused while the player is typing, giving unlimited time to complete even the longest commands. An AGI version of the game, however, was released as well.</desc>

		<name>King's Quest V : Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder</name>
		<desc>On a beautiful sunny day, King Graham of Daventry decides to take a stroll in the woods surrounding his castle. When he returns, he discovers with horror that his home, Daventry Castle, has completely disappeared! Graham is at a loss, and wonders how this could have happened, when a talking owl named Cedric appears. He tells him that he saw the whole thing, and that an evil wizard named Mordack whisked the entire castle away, along with Graham's family in it. Cedric offers to take him to his homeland, Serenia, where his master, the wizard Crispin resides. Surely Crispin will be able to help King Graham rescue his family from Mordack's clutches.



King's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder is an adventure game, and the first from Sierra to use a point-and-click mouse interface. Rather than typing commands on a keyboard to interact with the game world and use the arrow keys to walk around, King's Quest V instead simplifies all actions down to base commands. To access the different cursors, the player can move the mouse to the top of the screen, revealing a hidden menu with each of the different actions, as well as game options and the inventory bag. By clicking the "Walk" cursor on the screen, Graham will walk as close as he can to the appropriate area. Clicking the "Eye" cursor on items will provide a description, the same as typing "Look at". The "Hand" cursor is a multipurpose cursor that can be used to push, pull, interact with and pick up objects. The "Head" cursor is used to talk to people (and in the strange world of King's Quest, often objects and animals, too). Players can also right-click to cycle through the different available cursors. Inventory that Graham picks up now gets placed into a bag. By clicking on the bag, this opens up a sub-window that displays all the inventory that Graham currently has. In here, players can look at or interact with objects, combine them with other objects, or pick them up to use them in the game environment as another cursor.</desc>

		<name>King's Quest VI : Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow</name>
		<desc>For months Prince Alexander of Daventry has shut himself away from the world, thinking only of Princess Cassima, who he met while imprisoned in the previous game. Eventually he can take it no longer, and he hires a ship to search for the Land of the Green Isles located on the edge of the world. After months of searching he finally sets sight upon the island kingdom, only for a freak storm to strike the ship, destroying it and leaving him the only survivor. His troubles are far from over, however, as he soon finds out that the King and Queen have passed away, the Greens Isles are on the brink of war, and his beloved Princess Cassima may even be held prisoner by the royal vizier.



Like its predecessors in the series, King's Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow is a third-person puzzle-solving adventure game. For Alexander to save the Isles, he must travel between the Land's four magical islands, each based on myth and fables, and encounter people and strange beasts that will either help or hinder him. Alexander must be careful as well, because, as with all the King's Quest games, poor choices or missteps will often prove fatal for the Prince. Puzzles are solved linearly, although late in the game there are two completely different paths to take to reach the final confrontation. Like the previous game, actions are performed using a point-and-click interface with icons that represent verbs ("walk", "examine", "use", "talk", etc.)</desc>

		<desc>A team of adventurers seek out four magic objects in the dungeons of Dunshelm: The Shield of Justice, the Sword of Freedom, the Cup of Life and the Crown of Glory. Equipped with these, they hope to destroy the evil Lord Fear. Treguard, the dungeon master of the Knightmare castle, appears as an oracle to help in their quest.

Knightmare is a role-playing game and the second videogame adaptation of the homonymous British television series. It is very similar to the games of the Captive series, as it was developed by the same author. As in those games the interface is mouse-based, clearly inspired by the Dungeon Master one: the left mouse-button interacts with the environment, while the right button executes character actions. Movement can be controlled by left-clicking on the movement buttons on the screen or by using the keyboard. Once a weapon or an object is equipped, clicking on it brings up a menu with its actions. Knives, for example, have a menu with "stab", "swing" and "hack". A empty hand shows a menu with "punch" and "kick". The wand shows a list of available spells.

The game allows saving at any moment, but only loads saved games through the start menu. This means that in order to load a saved game, the player has to reset the game or intentionally kill the party.

The Proda involves placing matching pairs of crystals in such a way that they will be charged by beams of light. 

All the while, you must play the Haresh section, to keep your family under control. This involves financial trading; getting a fair price for the goods you produce, and buying the right amounts of food, clothes and other essentials. Money must also be donated to the Tsirit.

In Laser Squad you control a group of "marine"-like soldiers (and the occasional cyborg). Before taking them into battle, you must buy them weapons and armour with a predetermined amount of credits, taking into account the individual abilities of your squad. Unlike X-COM, the soldiers do not gain experience over time.

There are 3 missions in turn - in The Assassins you must face down Sterner Regnix and his guards, Moonbase assault challenges you to destroy the OmniCorp database, and Rescue From the Mines eschews violence in favour of a rescue mission. These are viewed from above and progress in turns. Laser Squad also features a 2-player "hotseat"-type gaming option.

The Evil Shogun has returned! Torn from his own time, The Last Ninja must defend himself once more with nothing more than the belief in his own abilities.

Last Ninja 2: Back with a Vengeance is an action/adventure game where the player, controlling a powerful ninja, must fight his way through opponents while collecting necessary items. The game is split into various levels, each of them depicting a different locale and divided into several screens. The view is isometric and the ninja can move in four different dimensions (he can also walk backwards) and jump.

Enemies, armed with fists and various ninja weapons, wander around the levels. The ninja must fight them either bare-handed or with the weaponry he finds along the way; in either case, he has a number of blows and attacks at his disposal, as well as the ability to block. There's a special weapon, shuriken, which are thrown in a straight line rather than used for melee combat; if they strike an enemy, they'll instantly kill or at least heavily damage him.

There are items scattered around the levels, such as keys, rope, a map or hamburgers (which restore health when eaten). Collecting these items and using them in a proper place is necessary for completing the game.</desc>

		<name>Leading Lap MPV</name>
		<desc>Hailed as a Ã¢â¬ÅFormula One Grand Prix beaterÃ¢â¬Â by new kids on the block, Kellton,  Leading Lap very nearly give the claim validity. But not quite.

Before we discuss why, let's look at what makes Leading Lap a creditable pretender to the crown. It's got a tremendous multiview 3D polygon based engine driving it and the frame rate is fast enough to ensure a smooth, believable motor racing environment. It makes use of extra memory, faster processors and FPUs with the handling of the various cars is such that if you drive too fast on a long bend the car spins out due to excessive speed Ã¢â¬â incredibly realistic for a game which is more arcade based than simulation. Finally, the driving has a reasonably good feel to it (or a hybrid between an arcade game and a simulation)

And then there's the but. An unfortunate but, but a 'but' nevertheless. There aren't enough competitors taking part in the race - four in all. To maintain a credible sense of conflict throughout a full race, there should always be someone to press for a place, or someone pressing for a place on you. That doesn't happen with Leading Lap. Still, it's fun in a limited kind of a way to reach the giddy heights of being the winner all the time. With twelve tracks to race on it's going to take you a reasonable stretch of extended play before approaching anything like full competency.

In all, a competent, enjoyable romp. Not quite up with F1 for immediacy and out and out pace, but still good enough to convince enough people to part with their cash for a few hours of solid entertainment. If you've got an Amiga friend, try out the serial link option; it's not bad.</desc>

The complex gameworld is over a mile squared and includes 40 miles of underground tunnels, as well a thousands of characters getting on with their daily business.

When designing your character, you can customise his or her looks, and this affects your likelihood of being befriended or fought. To make any inroads into finding Sven, you will need to join professional Guilds and complete quests. You have spells available to you, but will need to acquire more as the game progresses.</desc>

		<name>Legends</name>
		<desc>The premise of the Zelda style game is that a hero with a mission (rescue princess, free lands, destroy evil - that sort of thing) sets off on a voyage of discovery through different 'lands' or 'zones'. Picking up weapons along the way it ends up being a cross between a Commando style game and an adventure. Yes, you have to shoot or beat things roundly about the head with swords and like, but you also have to collect an inventory, talk to people and solve puzzles. Legends fits all of the above criteria. Give someone an object for a favour? Yes. this game is all about trading too.

Life is a precious thing in Legends. You have a certain number of continues, but there is no facility to save a game in the middle of a level, which is frustrating. One of Legends' great advantages is that you have four worlds to explore: North American, Egypt, Mediaeval, China and an additional Space Ship level. This provides major variety in terms of gameplay but it also means that once you're used to the enemies in one world everything changes in the next one and you start getting killed too easily.

Another annoying point about Legends is that the weapons are a bit weedy and the enemies are too persistent at times. This means that you can spend far too long high-tailing it out of situations without having enough chance to stand and fight, which I always find most enjoyable.

This is a step above Speris, and those who have boon searching for Zelda on an A1200 or A4000 need look no further. With various sub games, mazes and the like there is a lot of gameplay in here, and even though the various attempts at humour seem to fall flat (on me at least) it's still a fun adventure.</desc>

		<name>Leisure Suit Larry 5 : Passionate Patti Does a Lit</name>
		<desc>Passionate Patti Does a Little Undercover Work! is (despite the number) the fourth game in Al Lowe's Leisure Suit Larry series. The middle-aged would-be-womanizer Larry Laffer fell off a boat during a cruise and sustained amnesia, forgetting how he and his sweetheart Patti got separated, how Larry got a job in LA, how Patti got a job with the FBI, and what happened in (the never released) Larry 4. Now Larry and Patti are working independently on two cases that are connected to each other, even though the heroes aren't aware of that. Larry's new bosses are involved in shady business, while Patti agrees to take a break from her career as a performing pianist and become an undercover agent. Will the two be together ever again?

Unlike the previous games with their text input, Larry 5 utilizes a graphical, icon-based interface. The player uses verb commands ("Look", "Talk", "Use" etc.) to interact with the environment. In a way not quite typical for Sierra's adventure games, it is impossible to "die" in Larry 5, and the amount of "dead ends" (unwinnable situations) is greatly reduced. The game is also less puzzle-oriented, allowing the player to proceed even if he/she fails to solve the required puzzle in some cases. However, the player is awarded more points for finding the "right" solution. As in the third game, both Larry and Patti are available as playable characters during different chapters of the story.</desc>

		<name>Leisure Suit Larry II : Leisure Suit Larry goes Lo</name>
		<desc>The opening sequence of the game finds Larry mowing the lawn of Eve, his sexual encounter from the ending of the previous game, implying the pair have remained together. However, this is quickly revealed to be an instance of an unreliable narrator, as Eve pulls into the driveway with only the vaguest recollection of who Larry is. Realising that his affair with Eve was merely a one-night stand, a distraught Larry wanders off, winning a free vacation after stumbling into a rigged game show. During his preparations for the cruise ship, a microfilm falls into Larry's hands by mistake; this attracts the attention of the KGB as well as the mad scientist Dr. Nonookee (a pun on "no nookie"), who both want to recover the film.



Sierra On-Line intentionally toned down the titular character's sexual escapades for the sequel.[2] According to series creator Al Lowe, this lack of Leisure Suit Larry's trademark humor is an oft-cited criticism of the game.[2] Throughout the adventure there are recurring themes that contribute to the comedic effect, like visitation to identical barber shops in almost each location Larry visits; one of them is tended by Rosella of King's Quest IV: The Perils of Rosella.</desc>

		<name>Leisure Suit Larry III : Passionate Patti in Pursu</name>
		<desc>Passionate Patti in Pursuit of the Pulsating Pectorals! is the third game in Al Lowe's Leisure Suit Larry series. Larry Laffer has finally found the woman of his dreams, and can happily live with her together on the beautiful tropical island... until he gets thrown out of the house by his wife. His boss, who happens to be his (now ex-) father-in-law, fires him. Larry is all alone, without a woman, without a job, on an island that has long ceased to be a "tropical paradise" and is exploited by entertainers, lawyers, and alike. But never despair! Dressed in his irresistible leisure suit, Larry is about to conquer the world (or at least its female population) anew. Watch out, fairer sex, because Larry is back to his swinging self!

The game uses the same text-based interface and the same graphical engine as the previous entry in the series. The structure of the game, however, is more similar to that of the first installment: most of the time, the player is confined to one large area which can be freely explored. Unlike the two previous Larry games, the player does not just control Larry, but also - in the second half of the game - the enigmatic and beautiful pianist Patti, helping them to reach an ending that will finally bring happiness into Larry's life.</desc>

Across the 120 levels there are over 60 skills, although no more than 10 are in use on each screen. The Classic tribe has the ones from the original and is perhaps the best option for first-time players.</desc>

You are in control not of any individual Lemming, but of a cross-hair, which can be moved over any of the Lemmings. Along the bottom are a selection of functions which can be assigned to a Lemming, including climbing, floating and bashing. You must click to select the appropriate function, then click on the Lemming to activate it.

To diagnose a patient, you have to press on his or her abdomen, to see which portions of the stomach cause pain. Basing on this knowledge, you can choose a therapy for him (observation, medication or referring to another specialist) or administer a X-Ray or ultrasound scan to get more information about his illness. 

In some cases, surgery will be necessary. You're the surgeon and you have to perform the operation very carefully, adhering strictly to the procedures, preserving hygiene, and maintaining care when cutting up the patient. 

Should you mistakenly administer the wrong therapy, or kill your patient at the operating table, you're kicked into the medical school, where you're given hints as to what you've done wrong.

His father is the current King of the Savannah and the young prince is able to frolic the lands at will; jumping on and around other subjects of this animal kingdom. When Simba's father, King Mufasa, is killed and his evil brother Scar takes over the kingdom, Simba is banished from the lands of his birthright and has to grow up fast, honing his skills, for the day of his return.

The Lion King, based on the famous Disney movie, is a platform game where you control Simba - initially as a young cub, and later as an adult lion. The plot of the game follows the plot of the movie. Each of the levels represents a part of the movie. 

As young Simba, you can fight various beasts, such as lizards, by jumping on them. You can also roar to scare some creatures into submission, though every time you roar, you have to wait for your "roar meter" to charge. 

As an adult lion, you can still roar and jump, but now you fight enemies by slashing at them with your claws (if you're skillful enough, you can also grab them and toss them off the screen). 

The game features no in-game save function, and it needs to be replayed from the beginning every time.</desc>

Hours of fun for you (and a camel-friend if you like) blowing away horde after horde of alien fiends in the comfort of your own personal environment!

This game is based on an old Williams arcade game by the same dude who wrote Defender. The game - Robotron - was a big hit in the early Eighties. Llamatron takes the Robotron idea and distorts it in a Yakly fashion, adding loads of new stuff and plenty of furry beasties in the Llamasoft style.

You play the part of a totally hard laser-spitting llama. Your mission is to collect all the tiny sheep, llamas, camels and goats you see on each wave.  Standing in your way are great herds of unintelligent but numerous Grunt enemies, plus a veritable menagerie of nasty creeps which fire at you, dodge your fire, emit fire hydrants, try to ram you, murder your llamas and shoot your bottom off with lasers. Kill them deadly.

Not everything can be killed, and some enemies take more than one shot to destroy. Your ultimate objective - destroy the Ozric Tentacle of level 99 and get to Herd Heaven on level 100.</desc>

		<desc>Loom is an adventure game from LucasFilm. What sets Loom apart from other adventure games (in direct comparison with Sierra's) is its unique interface: you do not carry items around, but rather manipulate existing items through the use of spells. The spells themselves are woven through playing magical notes on a special distaff. Loom also features three difficultly levels, and differentiates them by changing the way the interface works: Standard features the distaff at the bottom of the screen but notes aren't written, whereas Expert doesn't have the distaff and you have to replay the spells by hearing alone.

In Loom you play the role of Bobbin Threadbare, a young man from the Guild of Weavers who just turned 17. Although you do not know why, you are outcast from the guild and blamed for the lack of prosperity in recent times.
After the Council of Elders is attacked and the Elders are turned into swans, you as Bobbin must set forth on a journey to find the swans and try to restore order to the Guild of Weavers.

Amiga game features excellent graphics and 4-player action via 4-player joystick adapter. You can, for example, easily execute one-touch football and aftertouch tricks. In contrast with most other soccer games of the era, you have full control over your goalie's actions. Coaching options, while much more limited than specialized soccer sims, are adequate: you can do substitutions, see players get yellow and red cards from the referee, and watch action replays. There's little difference between "full simulation" and "arcade" mode since the effects of your coaching strategies aren't too obvious in the game. Still, Manchester United Europe paves the way to more full-fledged soccer games from Krisalis, and is great fun for casual soccer fans who are confident in their joystick skills. It's not Sensible Soccer, but it has its own personality and style that deserve a closer look.</desc>

		<desc>Manhunter: New York is a point and click adventure game. Well, maybe not so much click. The game doesn't have outstanding graphics, even for that period. It doesn't have a richly developed storyline, either. What it does have is just enough plot and just enough mystery and adventure to keep most people interested.

Manhunter is puzzle driven with some arcade style action sequences thrown in. While the NPC character development is very weak, it is your detective skills in tracking the non-playing characters and determining their motives that makes the game interesting.

The game begins in the future. The year 2002 to be exact (ahem). Aliens have invaded New York and taken over the city. Being that the aliens have no arms and legs they must recruit humans to do the work of policing the population and eliminating any threats to the alien rule. Your part in the game begins two years after the invasion. You are one of the privileged manhunters and are rousted form your slumber by one of the aliens who is directing you to investigate a case involving an explosion and murder at Bellevue Hospital. Your adventure will take place over the course of four days. 

Bottom line. Even though Manhunter: New York is not strong on either the plot or graphics fronts it is, nonetheless, fun to play. The game will certainly test your puzzle solving and detective skills. Long live the resistance.</desc>

		<name>Manhunter 2 : San Francisco</name>
		<desc>In the year 2004 we're going to be invaded by eyeball-like aliens called Orbs, who pollute the environment, experiment on humans and hire manhunters. The Manhunters are human employees of the Orbs who have the job of tracking down, capturing and handing over people conducting anti-Orb activities.

The game action is broken up in four ways. First, there are close up views of your immediate area which allow you to interact with the objects and characters around you. Next is the transport screen, which is basically a map of 'Cisco showing all the locations you can visit. Third are the arcade sequences which include shoot 'em ups, and a maze-like game similar to that found in the hospital section of It Came From The Desert. Finally there are animated sequences which help break up the action and add to the atmosphere of the game.

There are no text commands; everything is entered via the mouse and the return key, so you don't have to worry about ambiguous transatlantic gibberish.

The graphics are technically poor and clumsy, but some of the animated sequences are superb. The accompanying soundtrack, however, is totally inadequate and spoils the effect. Overall, Manhunter: San Francisco is an exciting sequel. Don't expect a Leisure Suit Larry clone, it's nothing like it, rather Manhunter has a style all its own.</desc>

		<name>Maniac Mansion</name>
		<desc>The Edison mansion has always been a creepy old house on the edge of town. There have been rumors of strange experiments going on and of odd creatures living amongst the Edison family. There is even a story that a meteorite once crashed near the home nearly 20 years ago. More immediately, a girl named Sandy has gone missing from the local highschool and her boyfriend Dave swears that he saw Dr. Fred abducting her. Dave knows that he cannot do it alone and will need help from two other students if he has any hope of infiltrating the mansion and rescuing Sandy.

Players start by choosing 2 students to accompany Dave to the Edison mansion, and can then switch between these three characters at will. Most actions are carried out by selecting verbs on the screen and applying them to an object (such as "OPEN Door"). Each character maintains a separate personality and may have a different way to solve a problem from his classmates. Thus many of the puzzles can be overcome in different ways depending on the character being used. If any one of the kids are captured by the Edisons, they are thrown into the dungeon and must be rescued themselves by any character who still has their freedom.

The game is viewed from an isometric perspective, which makes it harder to stay focused on the direction the ball is to follow. There are tight corridors to follow and enemies to avoid. There is a 2-player mode in which players must race to the finish; otherwise you're racing against the clock.

This game is based on the idea of Bomberman. You can play with up to 5 enemies at the same time. The main goal is to survive and kill all the other enemies. You can do this by placing bombs on the ground. They will destroy the brick walls around you and may even release some extras to collect.

Very good Bomberman/DynaBlaster clone that only focus is on the VS Battle aspect of the game. It remains one of the best multiplayer PD games ever!</desc>

Ballblazer is a futuristic sport played in vehicles called "Rotofoils". The play field is a large rectangle made out of squares. The object of the game is to get a ball called "Plasmorb" into the goal, which moves along the edge of the play field. Otherwise, the rules are simple : "Three minutes, two players, one victor!"

The game is played in first-person on a split screen and can be played by either one or two players.

In addition to the original Ballblazer game, Masterblazer offers two new playing options: a Tournament Mode and a Rotofoil Race.

		<desc>Private detective Tex Murphy is hired to investigate the murder of a university professor. It turns out that he was one of eight scientists involved in Project Overlord, a mission to remotely control people. Tex soon learns of the deaths of other related figures. Suspects may include the British intelligence head, a surveillance company owner, and the professor's daughter.

Tex's first adventure takes the player through the seedy West Coast world of 2033, a setting that combines futuristic elements with film noir and "hardboiled" detective fiction styles. The game's main adventure portions are icon-driven, with object puzzles less significant than detective deduction and character interaction. Characters are represented by digitized photos.

Mean Streets features dozens of characters to interact with by asking questions or offering bribes. Fights often arise, but a diplomatic approach is more successful with characters whose guilt is unproven. Although it is largely an adventure game, travel between cities involves piloting Tex's Lotus Speeder in a flight simulation section. The game also contains side-scrolling action sequences where Tex has to eliminate a number of enemies before being able to proceed to the destination.</desc>

The game is split into 10 levels - the first 9 are groups of 3 territories which can be completed in any order, while the final 'Mother of All Battles' has its own surprises. 

Land is mostly of sand, grass or ice. You start with 100 men and you can use whatever quantity you find necessary on each island. The rest men left will go to another level with another new 100. In the second half of the game you can freeze men to save them for the Mother of All Battles. Once you select your island and place for your HQ, you must do some research for better weapons and defences. On the roof of your buildings you can put protectors like archers, gunmen, boiling oil men, and later on even laser turrets. If you send a team of unarmed men into an unoccupied square, they will build an additional base there, with larger armies completing this more quickly.</desc>

		<desc>Life in the 51st century it rougher than ever. Mankind, now under the rule of the Third Imperium, has realised his dream to reach into the stars, and has made contact with all manner of weird and wonderful alien life-forms for his trouble.
The most alarming of these extra-terrestrial contacts, made in 5018, was with a virtually identical race known as the Zhodani. The contact was not a pleasant one, however, and the first of four Frontier Wars soon broke out between the two races.
You'd think that after four bouts of inter-stellar genocide the two sides would have had enough, but, for reasons best known to themselves, a group of corrupt officials within the Imperium is preparing to start a fifth Ã¢â¬â and, as always, there's only one person that can stop them.

Well five people actually. Barely 10 minutes ago, your merry band of travellers was having a quiet drink when a frantic young lady pushed a holographic disk into your hands, burbled something about a traitor and was attacked by a group of thugs. You made your excuses and left... quickly. Now it seems there's a price on your head and every bounty hunter in the galaxy is on your tail.
So, to take stock of your situation: you hold the only evidence which can expose the traitors and have to deliver it to the officials on some faraway planet - all of this under the less-than-friendly scrutiny of the meanest villains in the cosmos, never rains but it pours.</desc>

Each level is not side-scrolling fluidly, but is divided into separate screens; upon getting to the edge of one screen you move to the next one. 

The Metal Mutant has the ability to transform into 3 different forms: humanoid, dinosaur and tank. Each form has different capabilities. For instance, the humanoid form can jump and the tank can shoot missiles. You'll need to change form often depending on the situation, as most obstacles and enemies can be only beaten by a specific form. 

Throughout the game, apart from fighting enemies (and bosses), jumping, climbing and so on, you will find additional upgrades which will give you more abilities. You'll also encounter recharge station where you can regain health.

		<desc>A party of brave heroes managed to defeat the corrupted guardian Sheltem as he attempted to destroy the world of CRON. However, the great battle between the guardians Corak and Sheltem continued in another place - the world of Terra, where Sheltem was originally appointed as a guardian. Revolting against the powerful race of the Ancients, Sheltem takes possession of their space-traveling nacelles, hurling them at the suns of other planets. It is now up to a group of local adventurers to help Corak and vanquish Sheltem once and for all.

Isles of Terra is the third installment in the Might and Magic series, and a sequel to Gates to Another World. Like its predecessors, it is a role-playing game focusing on first-person exploration of vast pseudo-3D environments, character building, and turn-based combat. The five selectable races remain the same as in the previous games, as well as the eight character classes with the addition of two new ones: Druid and Ranger. Like in the second game, characters may learn unique skills such as thievery, swimming, merchant, and others.

This installment does away with random or pre-set enemy encounters, featuring instead enemies dynamically roaming the game world, allowing to initiate combat from a distance (for example with ranged attacks or spells). There is no option to bribe or surrender to enemies, and escaping combat can be accomplished simply by moving away, unless the enemies have already locked on the party. An automap feature is available at all times, and the player is also allowed to save the game at any time.</desc>

		<desc>Monty Python's Flying Circus is an arcade style game based on the UK television series of the same name. Players control one of the "Mr. Gumbies" and maneuver him through multiple screens, throwing fish at flying feet and similarly surreal enemies. Periodically the game cuts away to a non-sequitur aside, such as a lesson on "the larch," or a quick game of breakout.</desc>

		<name>Moonstone : A Hard Days Knight</name>
		<desc>Something's happening in these lands, and the only hope seems to be the moonstone. You, as a chosen knight from the druids are about to find it and bring it back. The game can be played from 1 to 4 players at once, with no difference between solo and multiplayer as no matter how many players play, the story stays the same for everyone. However, if you choose to play with only one player/knight, the other three will be the computer rivals. Wandering through the map, you can visit enchanted places, towns where you can buy equipment or try your luck in gambling, but mostly visited places on the map will be cabins which represents the places where certain enemy beasts are. Each spot has about two or more beasts which after defeating them can be rewarding in a certain way, depending on game's randomize placement.</desc>

		<desc>The Mortal Kombat fighters, plus several new ones, return for a tournament held by the evil Shang Tsung of the Outworld. The action is one-on-one as before, and famed for its high level of violence and blood (other than the sanitised Nintendo version). There are 5 difficulty levels and optional credits, as well as the usual two player mode including same character duels.

To win the main tournament, the player must beat each of the other human players, before taking on Shang Tsung, Kintaro and finally Shao Kahn. Players have a range of punches and kicks available, as well as flying kicks, uppercuts, roundhouses, and the special moves, which vary for each player. These include throws, uppercuts, long-distance bullets, bicycle kicks and a teleport feature.

		<name>Mortal Kombat</name>
		<desc>Five Hundred years ago, an ancient and well respected Shaolin fighting tournament, held every 50 years, was corrupted by an evil and elderly sorcerer by the name of Shang Tsung.  Shang was accompanied by Prince Goro, a warrior of the Shokan race (a four armed half-human/half-dragon). Knowing that if ten tournaments in a row were won by the Outworld champion, the Earth Realm would be conquered by evil and fall into darkness, Shang entered Goro in the tournament and had him defeat the great Kung Lao. Goro has been  reigning supreme as the undefeated fighting champion for five hundred years now. As the last tournament required draws near, Raiden, Thunder God and protector of the Earth Realm, enacts a plan to tip the scales in the humans favor, Seven fighters step into the arena on Shang Tsung's mysterious island: Shaolin warrior Liu Kang, Special Forces operative Sonya Blade, the mercenary thug Kano, fame-seeking actor Johnny Cage, the ice wielding Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero and his undead adversary Scorpion, and Raiden himself.

Mortal Kombat is a side-scrolling 1 on 1 fighting game. Fighting is set as one on one kombat, allowing each player to perform a variety of punches, kicks, and special moves in order to defeat their opponent.  When the opponent faces their second round loss, the winner can perform a finishing move called a "Fatality" on the loser.  The Fatality is a move unique to each fighter that graphically kills the loser in a blood-soaked finale.

Mortal Kombat began its life as a 2-player arcade title. It is notable for its use of digitized actors to represent the game's fighters, as well as its use of copious amounts of blood during gameplay.

The gameplay focuses on conducting a detective investigation rather than on inventory-based puzzles, though items must be found and examined for its purposes. Conversations with suspects offer a wide variety of topics. The player wanders through the mansion at his own pace, but events would sometimes occur regardless of his actions. The game's interface consists of a drop-down menu with about two dozen different verbs used for interaction.</desc>

Set in the days of Greek mythology, you play the part of Poseidon, god of the sea.

And it is just your luck he picks on you first Ã¢â¬â to enter Hades and steal the fabled helmet of invisibility. Embarrassing, too, for the god of the sea, who cannot swim, and comes across deep waters early on in the game!

Do not be put off by it being a mini-adventure Ã¢â¬â it is about the same size as a 'full size' text adventure. You get four pictures up to usual Scrolls standard, plus text undreamed of in those bygone days!</desc>

The game engine and interface are pretty simple as all you have to do is to deploy units, offer support to your allies and decide on what military you are going to need.

Depending on what you choose to do the news will change in the a newspaper you can read (the is how the game tells about all events in the game) which is rather nice, because that makes the overview of the game very good. The game does offer pretty good graphics all though it isn't really needed for a game like this. But is definitely a plus.</desc>

Enemies are best dealt with by shooting one of your longer-range weapons towards them and waiting for it to hit them - this will release at least one coin, for points. Improved weapons can be collected, each of which functions for a limited number of shots.  Bonus items are often located in the more precarious parts of the level, leading you to choose whether to risk losing a life, and going back to the start of the screen (although previously killed creatures remain dead when you lose a life)

Because the Galactic Government does not deal with terrorists, they've sent construction worker, Pogo, to deal with the problem. This is where you come in. Pogo must (as before) make it to the top of the seven towers whilst avoiding all the baddies and traps that have been laid there for him. Once he gets to the top, the tower is toppled.

You make your way up to the top of the tower via walkways around the outside of the towers. You need to jump over, kick, and run from various enemies in your journey to the top. Most vertical movement is achieved by jumping onto moving ledges at the right moment.

The game was considered revolutionary in its time for its graphic technique. As the main character walked around the outside of the tower, the character was fixed in the middle of the screen while the tower itself rotated. This gave it a pseudo-3D effect.

Towers are linked together via a voyage through the sea in your trusty MK.7 submarine. This plays out as a side-scrolling collect-'em-up in which bonus points can be obtained.</desc>

There are two courses, plus a hidden 9-hole course on Mars with reduced gravity, with match play and stroke play options against one of 8 varied-difficulty computer players.

The control system is quite unusual, as the strength of the shot is chosen before you start the swing, but you have to click within a range to activate the shot, and this range is narrower if your shot is intended to be more powerful. An extra click can be made to add wrist snap, which increases the shot's power. The wind calculation is more complicated than most games of the era, and the rough is harder to play out of than usual, as you can't make slight stance adjustments easily.

		<path>./Nitro_v1.2.lha</path>
		<name>Nitro</name>
		<desc>Nitro is an top-down perspective arcade racer for the Amiga and Atari ST. It was developed and published in 1990 by Psygnosis.

This game contains no clear background or storyline, just white-knuckle video game racing. After choosing whether to play with one, two or three (via keyboard) players, the player(s) must select a car and buy accessories at the "pit stop" before proceeding to the race. Three vehicles are available; namely the racing car, sports car, and turbo buggy. Accessories include nitros, high speed, acceleration, traction, fix damage, a change of car, as well as fuel which is imperative to the racing campaign.

The game consists of 32 levels, but the game ends when the fuel is depleted. To prevent this, the player must finish in a high place on most races, which rewards the player with up to 600 gasoline units. In addition, power-ups float around in the levels as well as being placed on the track, but these may be picked up by any of the four cars.

There are four different environments. Starting on city roads, the player advance through forest and desert tracks before playing the last levels in a wasteland terrain. (Evidently, the Nitro story is that the apocalypse occurs, and the races go on. "The end of the world is nigh" is graffitied on the track.) Every four races there are night levels, which means that the screen is pitch-black save for the small area illuminated by headlights. Double headlights are available as a floating power-up.

Obstacles during races are commonplace. Examples are cones and holes in the road, which mainly slow down the player, and (blue) oil spillage which causes the car to spin. The Nitro manual makes reference to pedestrians, and says that in some races extra points are given for hitting pedestriansÃ¢â¬âhowever During a replay only 1 of the 32 levels has a message prior to entering the race, mentioning : money awarded for hitting pedestrians.

Nitro was also available as part of the Psygnosis monster pack, volume I, along with the original Shadow of the Beast and Infestation. The "monsters" in the game may refer to the playersÃ¢â¬ânamely, Clint Eastwood (P1Ã¢â¬âwhite), Rambo (P2Ã¢â¬âyellow), and James Bond (P3Ã¢â¬âred).</desc>

Accidentally, Colin has been digitized and curlified into his computer at the moment he completed the final level of the game. Colin has been trapped inside his own computer and an amazing array of challenges are standing between him and the escape from this electronic nightmare.

You have to move Colin Curly from the ENTRY packet to the EXIT packet by jumping from one platform to the next. Colin can only escape from a level if ALL the platforms have shut before he reaches the exit.

As Colin steps off a platform, it will slide shut behind him, never to open again unless it has special properties.  So, it is important to work out the correct route to follow in order to close all the platforms before Colin reaches the EXIT while still being able to move around the level.

		<name>Operation Thunderbolt</name>
		<desc>Operation Thunderbolt is the exciting sequel to Operation Wolf. An airliner is hijacked by terrorists en-route from Paris to Boston, who threaten to kill all hostages on board if their mates aren't released from jail. Instead of reaching its destination, the airliner makes a landing in Kalubya, Africa, and all the hostages are hidden in various locations. The authorities have asked the hero from Operation Wolf to rescue the hostages, but only this time, the hero brings his friend along for the ride.

There are eight missions to complete in Operation Thunderbolt, and each one has you shooting down soldiers, choppers, and tanks. The gameplay varies every one or two missions. In some missions, you are driving a jeep or controlling a boat, while in others, you are walking while you're shooting. You have a limited supply of ammo, and a limited supply of rocket bombs, but you can always stock up by shooting down crates falling from the sky, or by killing a cat or dog that get in the line of fire. Also from crates, you can get special items like bulletproof vests, rocket bombs, and different weapons.

You also have a life bar to worry about. If you're shot at by soldiers, or if rocket bombs or grenades are thrown at you, you 'll lose energy, and once you're energy is depleted,  you lose one of your three lives. You can lose a lot of energy by killing hostages on purpose,  and you can't easily avoid killing them if you decide to use rocket bombs to wipe out enemies. The eighth mission, the mission that involves you fighting terrorists on a plane,  proves to be difficult because a woman in a blue dress stands up and gets in the line of fire, and you have to very careful when you're going to use rocket bombs.

There are two endings to this game, and which ending you can watch will depend on the number of hostages you've saved, and whether or not you shot the pilot instead of the mission eight boss.

		<desc>Your name is Oscar. You have to run and jump through 7 Levels in Hollywood-style (Science Fiction, Western, Horror, Cartoons, Dino, Detective and Gameshow) to find Oscars (yes  the Academy Award!). 

If you have enough Oscars you solve the level. You can choose the levels in every order you want. In the levels you must jump on platforms to discover the level. 

You kill the enemies by jumping on them. Some of them lose a power up like invulnerable or a superjump. You can also find a JoJo to break down walls or using as ladder. Two creatures are no opponents. First the white rabbit. He gives you a extra continue. Second a red elephant. Touch him for using as save point in level.

		<name>Another World</name>
		<desc>Another World, also known as Out of This World in North America and Outer World (ã¢ã¦ã¿ã¼ã¯ã¼ã«ã AutÄ WÄrudo?) in Japan, is a 1991 cinematic platformer action-adventure game designed by Ãric Chahi for Delphine Software. The game tells a story of Lester, a young scientist who, as a result of an experiment gone wrong, finds himself in a dangerous alien world where he is forced to fight for his survival.

Originally developed for the Amiga and Atari ST and later released for the Apple IIGS and DOS platforms, the game was widely ported to other contemporary systems. Later efforts resulted in several game engine recreations for the game that permitted it to run on modern computers, consoles and mobile phones. In 2006, Chahi independently released a 15th Anniversary Edition for Windows which allowed the game to be played on modern computers with original or enhanced visuals; following up in 2011 for its 20th anniversary, ports of the game were prepared for iOS and Android based devices.

Another World was highly innovative in its use of cinematic effects in both real-time and cutscenes, which granted the game praise amongst critics and commercial success. It also influenced a number of other video games and designers.

Another World is a platform game, featuring a control scheme wherin the player uses either the keyboard, joystick or gamepad to make the protagonist run, jump, attack and perform other, situation specific actions such as rocking a cage back and forth. In the initial part of the game, Lester is unarmed, as he is able to kick at small creatures but is otherwise defenseless.

Later in the game, the player acquires a laser pistol from a fallen foe. The pistol has three capabilities: a standard fire mode, the ability to create force fields to block enemy fire, and a powerful charged shot that can break through force fields and some walls.[3] Eventually, Lester also gains a plasma ball that can be used like a grenade to defeat foes (not featured in the original Amiga release). Enemies also have the same capabilities, requiring the player to take advantage of the three gun modes and the environment to overcome them.

Lester and his alien ally cannot sustain any damage, and the game ends immediately if either of them is struck by a projectile or comes in contact with an animal or an environmental hazard.[4] However, the game uses numerous checkpoints enabling the player to keep restarting at the last point indefinitely. On the Amiga and older consoles without the ability to save a game, the player can write down an alphanumeric code for these checkpoints and re-enter it when restarting the game later. The game provides no clues as to what to do next, features no HUD (with an exception of oxygen bar during the swimming sequences) and no on-screen text, and the characters the player meets speak in unintelligible alien</desc>

Using a Transnuclear Hypernipple device he beams some fearsome enemies from a parallel dimension, who can see thorough his plan to wreck life as the Oxxonians know it - making them unable to eat their staple food, popcorn gateaus. In order to fix the situation, the player has to explore mazes, shoot enemies and find food, new weapons, money and tools. Badly all these things are hidden in boxes, of which there are several types. Opening boxes is not very easy: only if three boxes of one kind are standing beside each other, they open. The player can push and pull boxes (like Sokoban). Energy is decreasing constantly and therefore a constant time pressure is on the player.</desc>

		<path>./PacificIslands_v1.0_2812.lha</path>
		<name>Pacific Islands</name>
		<desc>Pacific Islands is the follow-up to Team Yankee and as its name suggests is set in the Pacific Islands, where conflicts demand the intervention of the USA and you, as a crack tank commander. You are in complete control of 16 modern American tanks which are divided into 4 squads.

The objective in each mission is usually to take control of key areas, destroy enemy communications, escort support groups, etc. In a nice touch, missions may be undertaken at any time of the day; night missions surprisingly being the easiest, as the enemy has inferior Infrared imaging to your tanks.

The graphics could be best described as 'functional', they certainly aren't to the standards of other war sims like Gunship 2000, but the functions are well laid out, simple and extremely easy to use.

Overall, Pacific Islands is an improvement over Team Yankee, although interface and dumb AI problems still remain. Once the initial problems of controlling 4 groups of 4 tanks are overcome, the rest of the game is quite easy to get into, and very rewarding. Recommended if you like tank sims, but don't expect it to be very realistic.</desc>

Pac-man can earn bonus points by eating the ghosts when they are in this state. The maze is now in 3-D and is larger than screen which will scroll to follow the action. To help get out of tight spots, Pac-Man now has the ability to jump. But be careful, because some of the ghosts have learned this trick as well and you could end up in a mid air collision!

		<desc>Pang is a platform game which consists of 50 levels in total. It can be played with one or two players on the same screen, and the other player can join anytime within the game. 

Your goal is to destroy the balloons which bounce around the playfield. To accomplish this, you can shoot hooks which travel upwards, and blow up any balloon they touch. Depending on their size, they either split on two smaller ones, or evaporate if they're at their minimum size. Apart from balloons, some levels also have barriers that have to be destroyed with your hooks, since they often block your access to balloons. There are also some barriers which cannot ever be destroyed. Your character has the ability to climb ladders, but cannot jump. 

You can also pick up power-ups such as: the ability to fire two shots at once, the hook that attaches to the ceiling and waits 'til something bumps into it, a gun which has a high rate of fire but cannot destroy barriers. Beside extra weapons, you can also pick certain things like clock (halting time for a small period), dynamite (reducing all balls to minimum size, thus making you able to reach more points), life, and such.

		<name>Paradroid 90</name>
		<desc>Paradroid 90 is a remake of the game Paradroid (released in 1985 for the Commodore 64) for the 16bit platforms Amiga and Atari ST.

A fleet of space freighters carry a cargo of battle and security robots to help in the defence of Basmyth. Alien ships were bombarding the freighters with disorienting beams which drove the robots crazy. The human officers were eliminated, leaving the ships open for occupation by alien forces. At this point the players mission starts...

You control a cybernetic influence device (ID) which has been teleported aboard the first freighter to eliminate all the droids and robots. Two ways are possible to clean the ship decks representing the action part and the more strategy part of the game: Shooting (action) to destroy the robots or connecting itself into an other robot's brain (strategy) and take temporarily control of it.

It's possible to play the game as a simple shoot-em-up game, but the main part of Paradroid 90 is the transfer game to take control of other droids.

It features 5 courses from across Europe, and 60 top European pros, rather than the US-leaned lineup of the original. The graphics are much more detailed and colorful, as you'd expect considering the intervening years of advances in programming skill.

The control system is the standard three-click method used in most golf games, but you can now define intended draw/fade levels in advance of playing the shot, so that a perfect aim leads to a measured effect, and an imperfect one exaggerating the effect.

As well as the Stroke Play games of the original (where you count the total score across the whole round of 18 holes, and compare this to your opponent), there are also Match Play (where the aim is to win as many individual holes as possible) and Skins (the same, but with money) modes as well.

The three-click control method (the first to start the swing, the second setting power and over-swing, the third setting draw or fade) allowed for a multitude of different shots, and required a sense of timing. 

Four courses are included, one of them a fantasy 'links' course designed by the programmers. Some of the holes are fiendish, with bunkers, water hazards and trees, and the need to plan strategies to get the best approach to the green.

When playing a tournament there are 60 opponents, each representing top US golfers - ten of these appear with tactical advice for each hole.

You can rotate the direction of fire while holding fire down, allowing you to move one way and fire another way (another Minter tradition - witness Llamatron). A Boost function exists to power up your ship, including plutonium pods which unusually can be collected and harvested by the end-of-level enemies as well as your own ship.

Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.

Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.</desc>

It was the first game to include the name "Sid Meier" in its title as an effort by MicroProse to attract fans of Meier's earlier games, most of which were combat vehicle simulation video games. The game is a simulation of the life of a pirate, a privateer or a pirate hunter in the Spanish Main in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries.</desc>

		<name>Player Manager 2</name>
		<desc>Player Manager 2 sets you as an international-standard soccer player who's stepped into being a player-manager at a lower-division side. The challenge is to reach the Premier League and survive.

Most of the standard features of management games are present, including pre-match tactics (which are fairly customizable), a full transfer market including short-term loan deals, detailed player statistics (presented visually), ground improvements and coaching.

Playing the matches is optional, as you can simply watch instead. There are 4 playing views, and you can play in position or as a team. Initially your player is by far the best in the team, so choose his position and use him wisely. Once you reach retirement age you can only play the matches for 3 out of every 4 seasons (which is poorly explained by an 'assistant manager' concept, but is more likely an attempt to make the game harder. This would make little sense though, because scoring is very, very hard in player-manager mode).

Before each match you get a video report from renowned pundit Alan Hansen, as well as some form notes which are said to be Hansen's.

The game features over 1000 fictional individual players to buy and sell, each with 8 different physical and mental skills rated, and you can choose which position to play these in. Four tactical systems are provided, but you can design your own and put it to the test in various situations using a raytrace system. Training sessions are presented visually, allowing you to pinpoint the exact ability and potential of a player.

The playing side of the game uses the Kick Off game engine. After a few seasons your player's ability fades and you eventually have to retire form playing and concentrate on management. You can however save your team and import it into Kick Off 2

		<name>Police Quest 2 : The Vengeance</name>
		<desc>Little time has passed since the events of Police Quest, when Sonny Bonds climbed the ranks of the Lytton police department and became the key element in the arrest of Jesse Bains, the notorious drug lord. After the trial, Sonny's application to the Homicide division was accepted and proposed to Marie, who had her prostitution charges dropped and started a new life away from the streets. Life was good - until Bains escaped, taking advantage of a low-security prison and an inexperienced correctional officer. Sonny is now in danger from a vengeful Bains and is saddled with his new chain-smoker partner Keith. Sonny goes to the field again to capture Bains, but things are about to get awfully personal...

Using Sierra's new SCI engine, the graphics are more vibrant than in the first game, but gameplay remains basically the same, with the player ordering Sonny to move to a place in the scene (either using the directional keys or the new mouse interface) and a parser interface to interact with the game world. Game sequences are more varied, and include a shooting range, an underwater search or searching the inside of an escape vehicle. The driving sequences are gone, and the player can relax while reading the chatter between Sonny and Keith as they move from location to location. The approach to the game, however, is radically different. While the first (for a large part) is based on street police work, this sequel is oriented into forensics field work such as collecting evidences that link Bains into the happenings of the game.</desc>

Popeye has four different levels to traverse through. His initial adventure takes him to a construction site where bouncing springs, falling girders and open welding flames impede his progress. Rolling barrels, and bombs which must be touched to be put out also stand to cause harm. In every level scattered hamburgers must be collected in order for Popeye to get past Wimpy who is often hanging out somewhere near the top of every vertically scrolling platform level. There are also feats of strength that Popeye must perform by beating up a punching robot-type thing with the aid of Spinach. Once past all these obstacles Popeye can move on to the next level.

The second level takes Popeye into the urban jungle where he must climb the side of the Biff Spinach building and avoid the same obstacles as in the previous levels. In the third level falling girders are replaced with giant bananas as Popeye finds himself in a jungle. Coconut throwing monkeys hang from ledges and snoozing tigers and snakes decorate the trees. The fourth and final level of the game finds Popeye climbing the masts of the S.S. Trev and the S.S. Andy as he makes his way to a final confrontation with Bluto and rescue Olive Oyl.

Popeye is able to jump around and occasionally when the situation calls for it punch his way through this vertical platformer. Bonus points are rewarded for finding Swee'Pea and Jeep. He can take multiple hits before he takes a curtain call but thankfully is unharmed by long drops. The player should beware as Popeye has only one life to get through the four levels of this adventure.

		<desc>Populous II: Trials of the Olympian Gods is a 1991 strategy video game in the Populous series for the Amiga, Atari ST and MS-DOS-based computers, developed by Bullfrog Productions. Populous II was remade and remastered for the Nintendo DS in 2008. Populous II is a direct sequel to Bullfrog's earlier game Populous and is one of the company's most notable games.

Like its predecessor, Populous II is a god game, where the player is guiding his people in battle against the followers of an enemy god. Whereas Populous only generally alluded to undefined deities, Populous II is specifically set under the backdrop of Greek mythology. The player is a demigod, one of Zeus's countless children with mortal women, and has to battle one Greek deity at a time until finally facing his father. Zeus has promised to let the player into the Pantheon on Olympus if he can survive all the battles.</desc>

		<desc>You play a god, gaming against other gods in a celestial game of conquest.  To win, you must help your chosen people take over the world and wipe out the vermin who worship that other god.

Each god starts out with a single human, dumped into the middle of the wilderness.  Sometimes there is inhabitable land in sight, sometimes not.  To get win, you must change the landscape, creating flat land for your followers to build on.  The more followers you have you have, the more powerful you will be, so take care of them. Build as fast as you can, because the other god is doing the same.

When you have enough followers, you can make the leader of your people into a hero.  He will then go around the land you have built, literally taking strength from the people into himself, and working his way toward the enemy.  When he gets there, he will engage in holy warfare upon your enemy's people.  He will burn; he will kill.  And he won't stop until they're all dead... or he is.

But you don't have to let your people have all the fun; the god's have other tools as well.  You can drown your enemies one at a time with your land lowering powers.  Submerge their towns in swamps. Raise a volcano in the middle of their best farmland.  Even better, you can flood the land and drain all the people who didn't build on high-ground. 

And when you win, you'll have 500 more worlds to conquer.  A god's play is just never done.

There are 6 different circuits, with hazards including chicanes, tunnels and crusher gates. Shading to the sections marks out whether a corner or dive is coming up. There are 5 computer opponents to race against in one player mode, while a data link cable allows 2-player games.

Each planet has its own atmosphere, and your machine's filters will need to be set to take account of this. Rain on some circuits necessitates a pitstop for a changeover. You are armed with afterburners, which can provide a speed use in open air but should not be overused. The Amiga version allows you to adjust the sensitivity of the controls - either way, joystick is easier to use but mouse is seen as ultimately being faster.

Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer with run and jump gameplay. Your hero must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple puzzles and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. An especially noteworthy aspect of the game is the very fluent animation of your character.

The Game Boy Color and SNES versions of the game feature additional levels and new enemies. The Genesis version has a new intro and an altered set of graphics but the level layout remains almost identical to that of the original.

		<desc>Six levels of horizontally-scrolling shooting await in this R-Type style action game. The attack waves vary in style, with some attacking you from quite fiendish angles.

These give off blue power-up tokens, which are used towards selecting one of many weapons. There are 4 front-firing options (guns, plasma, magma and laser-beams - guns can be built up quickly but lack top-end power compared to the others) as well as speed-up (only requires one token), side-shot, up to 3 homing missiles, build (a quick super-destructive blast that only functions when you aren't using auto-fire) and stealth (a period of invulnerability).

Each level has a very different setting, and an end-of-level boss to defeat. The chance to resume from the level you died at is offered up to level 3.

Unusually, the game has an option to emulate an auto-fire function using software (this makes it one of the few Amiga shoot 'em ups you can hope to get as far through on an emulator on keyboard as on joystick on the real thing).

		<desc>You're playing a small ant that is willing to help a friend in rather inconvenient situation. Apparently, your friend, doggie, likes to eat cookies that has his picture on their box, and he got himself so carried away that he lost the balance, and a bag of cookies fell deep down into an ant-hill. Now, you're goin' in, in a mission of solving puzzles, and retrieving the cookies for your friend.

Now, this ant-hill is a bit different from the ones you saw, and especially from the one you live in. It's path is filled up with boulders, and all the gates, and you must travel the quest to find the cookies. After each different place inside, you'll fins a small bag of cookie, and bring it back to your friend doggie.

The main quest consists of you carrying your-size boulders, and placing them in a well imagined line, so when you push the exact one, all must fall, and the one that marks the end must fall the last, or the door will stay shut permanently. Beside we know that ants are very easy, and can live almost every fall, you cannot practice that, so if you jusp from a little bit too high position, don't expect much, but to retry the level.

Every block, or boulder in a game has a different markings. Like for example, the yellow ones are bricks you can push, and they will just as easily fall, and push, or not, the brick in front of it. The red ones will do the opposite, you cannot push them, and if the yellow, or any other brick hits it, it'll continue falling back to the other side. Some bricks explode when you push them, or other brick hits them, and that way they leave the hole, so your brick can continue spining, or yet again, not. Some spin without stop, 'til they hit some other brick that can fall, some replaces the spaces, like building a bridge on that place, some go high and when hit the top, they stick to it, and push, or not, the brick in front of them. Anyway, that's the game basics.

Each level gives you the new code/password, so you can continue from the position where you ended each time you type that code. Perspective of your ant is like in any other platform game, and you control it with arrow keys, or joystick. But beware, the time is clicking, so you'll have to solve each level in a hurry.</desc>

		<name>Putty</name>
		<desc>In Putty, the player controls a blue blob with eyes. Putty has many moves that he could use to attack enemies or to navigate around the level. These abilities include being able to stretch out upwards, downwards, left and right to access far-off ledges. He also has the ability to inflate. This allows him to provide a cushioned landing for any falling bots. Over-inflation also acts as a "smart bomb", with Putty bursting, killing all of the enemies on the screen, whilst reducing his health in the process.

Putty is able to form part of himself into a fist, allowing him to punch left or right to dispatch enemies.

Putty is also able to melt into the floor, making him invulnerable and also allowing him to absorb enemies, recovering a small amount of health in the process. With certain enemies in the game, such as the clockwork orange, once Putty has absorbed one he is then able to morph into the enemy's shape to use its abilities.

A final ability of Putty's is being able to create a mug of coffee from part of himself, which will distract bots and make them stand still.

The levels in Putty are laid out vertically, with the screen scrolling up and down. The levels contain regular platforms, as well as "solid" ledges that Putty can not move through, and other special tiles including electric platforms and bounce pads.

The aim of each level is to rescue a set number of bots within the time limit. In the early sections of the game, the bots simply stand around the level. Putty has to absorb them, and carry them to the level's goal (either a flying saucer or an elevator). Later on in the game, the bots will jump around platforms, often falling to their death.

Invariably each level also contains various enemies. These enemies include Terminator carrots, Scouse sausages and sword-wielding spacemen. The enemies will attempt to hurt Putty in various ways. The attacks from some of the enemies will also hurt any bots that Putty is carrying at the time. If a bot is hurt four times it is killed, causing the player to have to find another bot to absorb.

Putty is also able to use powerups that are scattered around each level. These range from simple points bonuses to temporary invulnerability, to Uncle Ted. Once this latter powerup is collected, a man with a Hammond Organ named Uncle Ted appears, and proceeds to play a tune, causing all of the enemies in the level to freeze.</desc>

		<name>Puzznic</name>
		<desc>The challenge in each level of Puzznic is to maneuvre a selection of blocks into place so as to clear them all, by making them make contact with blocks of the same design. You control a cross-hair, which can move a block left or right, which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it would occupy.

There are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with 2 others, and immediately removing all 3. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example)

The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of 2 sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are 2 sets on level 2, 3 on level 3, 4 on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your 3 lives.

		<name>Quartz</name>
		<desc>Quartz is a shoot 'em up with a variety of sections. The first section (and every odd-numbered one) is viewed from above and scrolls in every direction. As well as standard attack waves, there are large red/blue/yellow balls which split on impact a lá Asteroids, and once the smallest ones are destroyed they release tokens. Once you have collected 9 of each, you can choose a power-up form a range including various weapons, restart points (which effectively gives infinite continues when used with an emulator's 'snapshot' feature) and repairs to the ship. Destroying the whole of standard waves gives combined tokens which add one to each of the three colours.

The even-numbered waves scroll in a single direction, but include waves coming at you from other directions, even from within the screen in 3D. You can have up to 3 power-ups stored on your ship at a time, and choose one to activate by pressing F1-F3 - they all have limited firepower. Unusually, when you have no lives left, death results not in game over, but the loss of one of your power-ups (chosen by you).

Directly following from the events of the first game, the newly-proclaimed Hero of Spielburg travels by flying carpet with his friends Abdulla Doo, Shameen and Shema to the desert city of Shapeir. The city is threatened by magical elementals, while the Emir Arus al-Din of Shapier's sister city Raseir is missing and his city fallen under tyranny.

After defeating the four elementals that threaten Shapeir, the Hero travels to the city of Raseir. There, he is imprisoned by Khaveen and under hypnosis helps the evil tyrannous wizard Ad Avis to resurrect the evil genie Iblis. In the final fight, the Hero attacks the palace and battles with Ad Avis, who falls to his presumed death begging for assistance from his Dark Master. As thanks for the Hero's success in liberating Raseir and restoring its lost splendor, the Sultan of Shapeir, Harun al-Rashid, rewards the Hero by adopting him as his son.</desc>

		<name>Qwak</name>
		<desc>In this game, you play a duck and the object of the game is to get the highest score without losing all your lives. This can be achieved by getting all the fruit and gems in the level, or killing off enemies. There are 80 levels to complete and once you complete all of them, the levels are repeated. 

You exit each level by collecting all the gold keys then entering through the door that opens. You have a certain amount of time to complete the level before spikes fall down the level. There are eight areas, all consisting of ten levels. At the end of each area, there is a guardian waiting for you, and again, you have a certain amount of time to defeat them.

You kill enemies by throwing orange-colored eggs at them, and in the earlier levels, they go down in one or two shots, but in later levels, you'll find out that all of them take more than two shots to bring down, so your orange balls would be useless here. The solution is to get a special power-up that will give you chocolate eggs.

Besides gold keys, you can also collect silver keys. This lets you unlock a gate, giving you access to more shots or power-ups. There are also booby traps in the level, such as spikes, and some parts of a level are blocked off by spikes. Get a mushroom and they turn into flowers that you can pick up. Beware, getting another mushroom will make them turn into spikes again. 

Apart from the normal levels, there are challenges where you have to complete a level and get all the fruit as you can under a 20-second time limit. Depending on gameplay, there are  also tricks where the last key you have to get flies away and you have to catch it. Other tricks include turning on the lights to see enemies, and running away from the "happy ghost". You'll receive bonus points at the end of the level if you manage to collect every gem in the level.

Qwak can be played as either a one or two player game. The game was released at budget price, and later on a CD double pack with Alien Breed '92.

		<desc>With $100000 in the bank after taking out loans and selling stocks, it's time to start a railroad! Choose from 4 scenarios across two continents with randomly generated resources, and design your own railroad that moves people and goods across the country. Use the revenue to continue expanding, while keeping control of your company and appeasing your stock holders with growth and revenues. Play the stock market with company assets. Drive your competitors out of business with buyouts and rate wars. Multiple types of resources to carry (roughly grouped as slow freight, fast freight, passengers, mail) and convert, own facilities to maximize profit (buy a steel mill and the conversion from iron ore to steel makes money for YOU). Use the latest available technology to your advantage (new locomotives). Your objective is to retire with a huge bonus (based on your company's assets) and become the President or the Prime Minister (depending on which continent). 

The game is essentially a bird's-eye-view real-time strategy game with aspects of building and stock market manipulation. Each fiscal period is 2-years, which corresponds to 1-day of track time. Build different sizes of stations to take care of different local needs, create trains that switch consists at different stations and maximize throughput. Upgrade/retire/modify trains as times change. The faster the trains arrive, the more money they earn. Multiple options will keep you busy as each game is different.</desc>

		<name>Rise of the Robots</name>
		<desc>Rise of the Robots emerges from the hype and reveals itself as a good-looking but rather unwieldy beat-em-up. The game, in all of the currently available versions, is just not that good.

In terms of pure beat-em-up action, Rise of the Robots is outclassed by the barely-better-than-16-bit BODY BLOWS games. ROTR is quite poor in the "special moves" area of beat-em-up gaming. The graphics? Well... the animations are good. The characters, when still, look very good too. When moving they are anything but realistic looking. Their movements are jerky and very repetitive. What's different in each version? Not a lot. All of them suffer from the poor control and jerky animation.

The non-AGA version takes less time to install on the hard drive than the AGA version because some of the Ã¢â¬ÅcinematicsÃ¢â¬Â have been taken out. They're not much of a loss really. This version also looks pretty good considering the number of colors onscreen. It seems to play a tad faster too.

Disappointment is the key word here. The game promised so much and delivered so little. I guess one good thing is that, for once, the PC suffers from the exact same problems.</desc>

While it featured a succession of levels based around sections of the movie, these were highly varied and presented in polygon 3D graphics. These can be played in any order in the Arcade mode, or in planned sequence in the Movie Adventure mode, which follows the film's plot of Japanese investors wishing to replace Robocop with their Robot Ninja designs, and thus expecting him to prove himself as superior.

The first task is a car chase resembling Chase HQ, in which a mazey section of road must be followed efficiently. There are several first-person 3D shooing sections,. in which you must use a target to shoot down punks and invaders, without harming civilians. Robocop also takes to the skies in a simulation of his new Gyropack flying device. Also, he must do battle with his intended replacement in a fixed-perspective beat 'em up section.

He can move left, right and duck but can not jump. Different weapons can be picked up from enemies, and power-ups to restore health and/or energy. Following levels, RoboCop will have to match a criminal's face to the proper mugshot and engage in a first-person shooting bonus round.

		<name>Rock Star Ate my Hamster</name>
		<desc>You are Cecil Pitt, a wannabe rock star manager. You must choose from 1-4 rock stars (with names such as Tina Turnoff and Wacko Jacko) to manage by viewing their audition tapes. Once you chosen your artists you then have to choose what kind of gear to get them - spanking new, second hand or dodgy. The dodgy gear is dirt cheap but you might pay for your choice later on in the game.

To make your group a star, you have options such as practicing, publicity stunts, and buying gifts for your stars. Each action you choose advances the calendar by one day and you have until December to achieve your ultimate aim of superstardom - represented by a line graph which rises or falls depending on the performance of your band's releases.

Once your band has recorded their first album you can choose to release the single and/or the album. The single needs a video to go with it which costs varying amounts of cash depending on which director you choose. You can choose to go for publicity, but this can be risky as there is a chance that one of your rock stars will be in the papers as an ex-rock star who died in any of many strange ways (all that's missing is a 'bizarre gardening accident'). Publicity affects your sales directly and also affects the crowds who attend your gigs. You lose the game if either you run out of money, or all of your rock stars die.

		<desc>In the 1940s, the Nazis built a base on the moon and plan to use a mysterious substance called Lunarium to reduce people's intelligence. However, in the 21st Century time travel has been mastered, as have jet-propulsion backpacks, plus some cataclysmic weaponry and advanced code-breaking equipment. Thus, you are sent back in time to change the result of the war using this technology to find their five rocket factories and destroy the moon base.

The game fits the Cinemaware template closely, with a string of action sequences linked by cinematic animation sequences to set the scene. There's also a strategic element, as you move your spies around to gain information and avoid detection, and decide how much Lunarium to use at each stage of the game. Action sequences include hand-to-hand combat with a Nazi guard, and flying through the air shooting either hordes of enemy planes or the Zeppelin itself.</desc>

		<name>Rodland</name>
		<desc>Taking a rather literal view of the term 'slap-stick humour', Rodland features two fairies called Tam and Rit, whose mission is to rescue their mum who's been captured and taken to a castle. 

There are 40 screens to clear, all full of baddies, who are disposed of by grabbing them with a stick, and flipping them from side to side to inflict damage. The hits needn't all be inflicted at the same time, as it's possible to release them to move them out of the way.

When killed, each bad guy releases some kind of extra, ranging from points bonuses to various devices which can be used to kill other enemies.

Each level also contains a certain amount of fruit. If you can collect all of this (with some bad guys still alive - you move on immediately once they're gone) you enter a bonus game, in which each enemy's death results in one of the letters E,X,T,R and A being released - collect them all for an invaluable extra life.

In the Game Boy version the difficulty lies slightly lower because the player can use his wand even when climbing ladders.

		<path>./Rotor_v1.1.lha</path>
		<name>Rotor</name>
		<desc>You control a battle tank (the Rotor) which hovers in a 2D-labyrinth. Gravity pulls heavily on the Rotor, making it fall towards the ground. As any contact with walls or enemies is deadly, your main task is to avoid that. You may rotate your tank freely and accelerate via an afterburner, thus manoeuvring through the corridors -- imagine a mix of Asteroids and Lunar Lander to get an idea of the physics.

Scattered throughout the 18 different fortresses are boxes. Shoot these open to find either a) Fuel: this will replenish your supply, which is drained by shooting and accelerating. b) Sun crystals: Collect all to finish the mission. c) Bombs. They will explode in 30 to 60 seconds, destroying your ship. You can avoid that by leaving the screen quickly, or by picking the bomb up; this earns you major credits, but your ship drops much faster due to increased weight. d) Pearls. Collecting these advance the upgrade counter by one to three steps; you may activate the current upgrade at any time, which will improve your rotation speed, engine strength, weapon, shield etc. Boxes are emptied by carefully flying very, very close to them and activating a tractor field.

As if gravity and accurate flying wasn't challenging enough, the game also confronts you with various enemies. All of these are immobile and fire in a straight line; the sheer mass of them makes avoiding the bullets a difficult task nevertheless. Apart from turrets, there are attractors and repulsors who'll smash you into walls, and force fields that need to be deactivated by finding and shooting a switch.

The tricky labyrinths together with the short supply of fuel, weight constraints and clever upgrade system make Rotor more a game of tactics and accuracy than arcade action. Wild shooting and careless flying will deplete your fuel in no time; you'll have to progress carefully to discern traps in time.

		<name>R-Type II</name>
		<desc>R-Type II is a horizontal scrolling shooter arcade game developed and published by Irem in 1989. It is the second game in the R-Type series.

The player controls a ship called the R-9C (or R-9 Custom), which is an improved version of its predecessor game's ship; the R-9. The ship's design was changed slightly, and the wave cannon was given homing capabilities. Two new types of weapons (the Search Laser and Shotgun Laser) were added, bringing the total number of weapon types up to five. A new anti-ground unit bomb was also added to the missile inventory.

Though the number of levels was decreased from the prequel, the number of enemies, their durability, and the number of bullets they shoot were greatly increased. Enemy movements and terrain were also made trickier, bringing the game's difficulty up considerably. The same revival system is used as in the prequel, where the player is brought back to a checkpoint whenever their ship is destroyed.</desc>

		<name>R-Type</name>
		<desc>R-Type is a side scrolling shoot 'em up best known for its extremely tough and strategic gameplay.  You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire.

The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called "The Force", which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements).

The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger's artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the memorisation that is required of R-Type's contemporary rival, Gradius.

		<desc>RVF Honda puts you on board a realistically-modeled RC30 bike, with the task of becoming world champion. Initially you race at Clubman level on fictitious local tracks (one of which is set in MicroProse's old UK home of Tetbury), before moving up to UK and then World championship racing if you're good enough.

Each class of racing has 8 computer opponents, with the top 7 finishers in each of the championship's 8 races scoring points, and the races can be set to 5,10, 15 or 20 laps. The game's graphics appear to feature sprite-based bikes atop polygon scenery, which makes for very fast gameplay. 

The circuits feature puddles of water to upset the bike's handling, and oil, which causes you to crash. It takes time to remount the bike and get back up to speed by revving it back up (more realistic than most motorbike games at the time, but frustrating as you suffer for mistakes more), and after a couple of crashes the bike's dashboard fails, making it much harder to ride competitively.

There is a two-player null-modem link-up mode, which can support an ST racing against an Amiga if you have the right cable.

Even before you get into the main gameplay, there is a lot of strategy involved in choosing weaponry, as they make different amounts of noise when used (reducing the stealth potential) and their ammunition is of varying weight.

In each turn you have limited action points per soldier, which must be used for all movement, firing and reloading moves. The maps are viewed isometrically, with a compass used to indicate the directions of movement, and where the incoming fire emanated from.</desc>

		<desc>Sensible Golf is a 2D golf simulation.

Having been quite successful with their cute action soccer game Sensible Soccer, Sensible Software decided that the concept of "No fuss, just fun" could be applied to other sports, too. They chose golf.

Sensible Golf is not an accurate simulation of golf, but an action adaptation of the sport streamlined for quick and easy gameplay. Consequently, complications such as wind and terrain heights are not featured, although the green has little arrows indicating the slopes. Apart from that, the player's only concerns are the water and sand hazards, and the distance to the hole. As a result, Sensible Golf is instead a practice in target shooting, rather than a golf game.

Striking involves only two action: Aiming the pointer in the desired direction, and pressing the action button three times. The game uses the well-known three-click-control, with which you set power and swerve of the strike. The computer automatically suggests a proper club, but the player may change it manually. A pop-up map helps one find their bearing.

The courses are fictional, composed from a pool of holes which often appear in multiple courses, sometimes with minor variations. Play modes include single 18-hole rounds, a complete season and a tournament. Up to 72 human players may participate in the latter.</desc>

		<desc>The updated Sensible World of Soccer, with more up-to-date-teams and less of the bugs from the previous version.

SWOS is a top down football/management game, with either quick game or 20-year career player-manager options. The games are set to last 3 minutes, but the 20-year career can suck in your entire life for a few months. The graphics are kept very small so the player can orientate themselves on the pitch without need for a radar. The controls are simple, easy to get used to and very effective. In the full career mode you can jump from club-to-club buying any of the game's 29000+ players, as well as play around with team tactics.

And you can choose from 1400 teams over the five continents.

		<desc>Greatly enhanced version of "Sensible Soccer". Virtually any important soccer league in the world is included in this game, with some countries not only having premier / first division, but 2nd, 3rd, and more divisions. All important international competitions are also included (club- and national-team based). The game has a career mode, where you may play up to 20 seasons as player manager or manager only. During a career as a coach you're not tied to one club / national team, meaning if you're good enough one (or more) big clubs make offers to you to coach their team. This works both ways. [AFAICanProve] All teams featured in this game have "real" players (names, strengths, weaknesses, etc.) from the ~1995 season. The management part of the game allows you to buy any of these players (which number 24,000 in total) if you have enough money (and a free slot in your team, of course).

Besides the player manger career, one may play friendly matches, single season of any competion, and custom competions (can be made from scratch or based on a real one). Teams participating in these competitions can be chosen from any country. All / Any teams may be played by human or computer.

		<name>Shadow Dancer</name>
		<desc>Shadow Dancer is a one-player game in which you control Shinobi. With the help of your dog, you must kill your enemies while you venture through locations such as airports, railroads, waterfalls, sewers, and more.  Furthermore, you must find and disarm several bombs along the way before you leave each. You also have the option of using magic against enemies, which may consist of tornadoes or fireballs.

There are five missions you must complete; and each one has different objectives such as obstructing the enemies deadly mission, disrupting the enemy's supply route, raiding the enemy's industrial units, attacking the enemy's underground forces, and liberating and securing the shuttle's base. Each mission consists of three stages and there is a boss on each of the mission's final stages. 

What's good about the dog, you say? Well, if you tell it to, the dog will maul enemies (provided that the dog barks at them when you face them) and distract them long enough so that you can shoot at them. Remember that you have a limited time to do this, as the enemy will eventually kick the dog off him. This causes the dog to yelp and shrink, making him powerless against them.

Along the way, Aarbron befriends the wise dragon Barloom and must defeat the evil dragon Ishran. Tree Pygmies in the forest and the goblins in the Crystal Caverns serve as interactive, complicated foes. For example, a bottle of booze picked up at the Karamoon oasis must be given to the goblin jailer to free Aarbron from his cell. Only after Aarbron gives the old man his ring and his parchment does he obtain a spell powerful enough to harm Zelek.</desc>

		<desc>While very young, Aarbron was kidnapped and enslaved by the Priests of the Beast Lord. He grew up on drugs made to destroy his own will and turn him into the Beast Messenger, a powerful creature serving Maletoth, The Beast Lord himself. He did his job, until one day he noticed a man about to be sacrificed in a ritual, his face triggering ancient memories... and as the sacrificial knife descended into the man's body, Aarbron recognizes the face. Of his father.
As his father dies in the altar, memories of his childhood and tormented past at the hands of the Beast Lord emerged, and as feelings of hate over his captors took over him, he swore revenge and fled the temple, knowing the road to avenge his father and redemption would be hard.

Shadow of the Beast, one of Psygnosis most popular titles during the 16-bit computer era is a side-scrolling platformer best known for the use of parallax scrolling along lush graphics, a musical score  by David Whittaker, a iconic cover by Roger Dean and what many consider to be unforgiving gameplay, balancing between the "very challenging" and the "impossible". The player has to navigate through several areas filled with enemies and traps, collecting keys and activating triggers than open new areas or give Aarbron the means to overcome a sub-boss. The number of moves the player has at disposal is limited: duck, jump and only two attacks: punch and a flying kick. While most enemies die with just one hit, the player must time each attack accurately. However, there are also traps of objects that cannot be destroyed, and these require the player to jump, duck or move according the sequence. The player has only one life with 12 hit points that can be replenished by collecting some objects hidden in the level (like an off-route location or a under a megalith), which also contributes to the difficulty level.

		<desc>Shadow Warriors is a direct port of the arcade version of Ninja Gaiden. It is a beat'em up in the veins of Double Dragon featuring Ryu Hayabusa, a ninja who must fight members of an evil cult who seek to fulfil Nostradamus' end of the world prophecies.

Ryu Hayabusa can attack his enemies using his his bare hands and feet or using a sword (for a limited time). He can also perform moves such as a flying neck throw, a back flip and hang kicks, performed while hanging in scenario objects. Throwing enemies against objects such as phone cabins, oil drums or dumpsters will destroy them, revealing power ups such as health items and swords. At some points, Ryu will have to perform acrobatic moves to carry on. He has a life bar starting with 5 units.

The game takes place in United States' locations such as Las Vegas, North Carolina, Los Angeles, the Grand Canyon and Brooklyn. The enemies in those stages are mostly of the same 5 kinds, including Jason Vorhees' look-alikes and other masked men. There is a boss fight at the end of each stage.

A two-player co-operative game is also featured. Whenever the player dies, a continue screen will appear showing Ryu chained to a table while a circular saw descends upon him.

		<name>Shadowgate</name>
		<desc>Using the same graphical interface as Deja Vu, Shadowgate is an adventure game set in a fantasy world. Players take the part of an adventurer sent to the ancient keep of Shadowgate on a quest to find a mystic artifact known as the Staff of Ages and stop the evil Warlock Lord from summoning a horrific demon known as the Behemoth. However Shadowgate has become infested with the Warlock Lord's demonic minions, not to mention the castle's still functional booby-traps.

Unlike Deja Vu, death comes at you suddenly, unexpectedly, and most of all OFTEN. Such simple acts as pulling the wrong switch or opening the wrong door can cause you to be skewered by a booby-trap or disemboweled by a monster. It's allso worth mentioning the fact that if your torch burns out (this happens quite regularly) and you forget to light a new one, you'll trip in the dark and break your neck.

A Windows 3.x update to this game was created in 1991.

		<desc>Viewed isometrically, this role-playing game saw you leading a party of four intrepid souls on a mission to restore peace to the land. Sixteen levels awaited them, all filled with traps and monsters. Spells could be collected as the game went on, and multiple ones cast in quick succession. The characters could be split, and sent off on different routes and tasks to save time.

The games title was inspired by its innovative use of light, or rather of darkness. Nothing could be seen without the torches your characters had; these meant that vision faded outside their circular arc. You had to manoeuvre the torch around to reveal secret areas, and it could be used to ward off some monsters, although it alerted others to your presence.

The gameplay involves 144 tiles, each depicting different images, which have to be removed by matching them into pairs. The tiles are arranged in a gridded pattern, which is higher near the centre. A tile can only be removed if it has no tile next to it on at least one side.

This computer implementation can generate a random board layout to take on, as well as featuring 5 preset challenges, some of which have time limits of 5 or 10 minutes, as well as a multiplayer mode.

		<desc>Football fever hots up some more as Sierra release their own entry into the computer game World Cup, and it's a very competent and extremely playable arcade soccer game it is one of the most instantly playable arcade football engines yet seen.

Let's begin at the beginning. You can either play as a team in the official World Cup draw, or take part in a random one. Up to eight people can play at once, each selecting a team and playing through their respective groups until victory or rejection. Playing a game is incredibly easy, far easier than the Kick Offs and Sensible Soccers of this world. The reason being that there are none of the combinations and strange joystick positions of those games. Have no fear, as Sierra Soccer is just as addictive and just as much fun. Whether you have an A500 or an A1200, you'll be amazed at the spectacular animation of the players on the pitch. Over 4000 frames of animation have the players running, jumping, sliding, falling face down and there's even a fully mobile referee, complete with working whistle. A1200 owners get the benefit of a full 3D crowd too!

It may not have a big licence behind it, but Sierra Soccer is still great fun to play, and well worth adding to any collection.</desc>

Player 1 would play as a helicopter, but if a second player joined the game, they would play as a jeep. Both players would have to protect each other as well as themselves. After a certain number of kills, a "goose" helicopter would form on the screen. If the players managed to destroy it they would get a weapons powerup. This would go on throughout the entire game (a "goose" could appear even during the end of level baddie!).

There are four different cars to choose from: a rally sports car, a high-wheeled muscle car, a monster truck and a buggy. There are two sets of six tracks each, each track measuring roughly three by two screens in size. Apart from the usual simultaneous two-player option, where both play on the same computer, there is a (null) modem link option, allowing four players to compete at the same time. Additionally, messages can be sent via the serial line, so as to taunt the opposing team. Depending on the available memory, there are either one, two or four kinds of cars partaking in the race.

An additional AGA enhancement disk, for Amiga 1200 and 4000 systems, updates the game to use sub-pixel scrolling and makes the sprites high resolution with greater colour depth.</desc>

		<desc>CTA's original IP stars a toon dog called Ralph who must stop his sleepwalking master Lee from waking up. Ralph must bridge gaps, beat up baddies, stop Lee falling into water, inflate his own body and float above obstacles, and generally be a selfless version of man's best friend.

Between each of the major levels, there is a dream sequence where Ralph can collect various tokens and trigger what he "really" thinks should happen to Lee.

The are six huge parallax scrolling main levels and five bonus levels. There are several full motion video sequences setting the story.

There is also a special Amiga 1200 version which has enhanced full motion video and in game graphics.

		<desc>Aliens attempting to steal the World Cup have crashed as they tried to flee, and the Cup has been broken, its pieces scattered around the globe. As Soccer Kid, you must retrieve it. During your journey you will visit Britain, Italy, Russia, Japan, and finally the States.

Soccer Kid is a platform game with some unique elements.  As the name implies, you have to kill your enemies with your ball. Football-style tricks of keeping the ball in the air and under control are especially useful - headers and overhead kicks can be played with practice. You gain access to the pieces by collecting 11 Player Cards across each world.

There is a saving feature that gives you the ability to save between each country (but not between individual levels).

		<name>Space Ace II : Borf's Revenge</name>
		<desc>You might be surprised to note that despite coming on five disks, Space Ace II only really gives you about four sequences of action, which are then subdivided into the tiny little blow-by-blow segments or scenes which you actually play. This, coupled with the tendency of the animations and samples to be cut off abruptly, gives the game a very bitty feel. Secondly, it's lazy. The same death sequences are used repeatedly, even in very different scenarios.

Game looks pretty, and it's moderately entertaining for about the first 3 minutes but you will finish it inside three hours (absolute maximum) and you'll hate it so much by the end that you'll never want to see it again.</desc>

Now Ace/Dexter must not only rescue his girlfriend Kimberly but also prevent the destruction of the Earth at the hands of Borf.

Readysoft's version of the laserdisc arcade game Space Ace for 16-bit computers follows the mold of their earlier Dragon's Lair adaptation: only selected scenes from the original game are used, with all the graphics redrawn from the original cel animation to fit the capabilities of the target machines.

As in Dragon's Lair, the game consists of the cartoon movie running by itself, with the player being required to press the right button at the right time (either moving or firing Ace's gun) or see one of many death animations. The original arcade game offered some alternate paths through the game by letting the player choose between playing as Dexter or turning him back into Ace - the computer version is missing this option, and one always plays as Dexter or Ace depending on the scene.</desc>

Controlling GERALD, you must move through the isometrically viewed landscape (largely flick-screen on the ST). There are two skill levels; the harder one features more of the precarious ledges and falls of Spindizzy. Each one takes you to a different matrix of levels, which can be played in different orders and each consist of 10 screens, with a bonus level at the end.

You have limited energy, which can be recharged by collecting crystals. Fuel is limited, and is reduced by contact with hazards - generating a replacement GERALD takes time. There are many gates which are opened by running into spaces of the same colour. There are also aliens to avoid, and most movement is along thin slippery ledges with heavily inertia-based controls.

Starting from opposite corners, they take it in turns to move, either by 'reproducing' one of their spots to form another one in an adjacent square, or by making a jump, losing the square you did have but taking one two spaces away. When a piece lands next to one of another colour, that piece changes colour into that of their opponent. The winner of each round is either the last player with any pieces left, or the player who has the most pieces left when the level is full.</desc>

		<name>Star Trek - 25th Anniversary</name>
		<desc>Captain Kirk and the USS Enterprise are representatives of the United Federation of Planets. Their role in space is that of explorers as well as a military presence. The Enterprise routinely encounters strange adventures and bizarre situations, each laid out as a separate "episode" which must be played in order. The first episode involves the USS Enterprise being called to a world to investigate strange "demons" have appeared from the mines and begun attacking the settlers.

Star Trek: 25th Anniversary is based on the 1960s Star Trek TV series. The game is a combination of a point-and-click, side-scrolling adventure game and a first person starship simulator. This tie-in actually missed the 25th Anniversary of Star Trek's TV debut by half a year (nearly three years in the case of the Amiga version), but it uses the original series' characters and settings. Players directly control Captain Kirk, leader of the Starship Enterprise, and are able to give orders to other crew members. While the enterprise is on a peaceful mission, combat is possible. A new game begins on the bridge of the Enterprise, seen from a 3rd person view of Kirk, but a first person view out the viewscreen of the Enterprise. When on board the ship, Kirk can contact Chekov to assign a designation, raise shields or begin combat, contact Sulu to engage warp or adjust magnification, contact Spock to scan for data and search for keyword information, contact Uhura to deal with communications, and contact Scotty to change power allocation and repair damage and beam down to a planet. During combat, the player steers the Enterprise manually and is able to turn in 720 degrees of direction as well as increase or decrease speeds. Weaponry includes phaser banks which draw from the ship's energy and proton torpedoes which are in limited supply.

The adventuring bulk of the game comes in the form of many landing party missions, in which the player beams down to the surface of a planet and explores the situation. Kirk can move about on the screen, other crew members automatically follow him. From the menu, he chooses a body part to perform an action: eyes represent looking, mouth represents speaking, one hand represents using items (and crew members) while another is to pick up objects. Kirk carries an inventory of items collected which can be accessed and used at any time. In most missions Kirk will carry a communicator to contact the ship and a phaser weapon which can be set to "stun" or "kill", The point-and-click adventure has different solutions to problems, but the ideal goal of the federation is to solve things non-violently. Performance is rated accordingly as well as being based on how many extra discoveries and advances made and interaction with different beings, including aliens. The surroundings are all based on styles from the TV series and solutions to puzzles involve the skills of multiple crew members.

However, you must fight an end-of-level bad guy once you have finished the 6th level of a world. While each level has the standard disintegrating rocks to destroy, all but 2 of them have extra bad guys, with a range of attack patterns.

There are a number of different weapons available, which are collected by moving your ship so that it crosses their paths as they float through space. Each of these can be powered up - some weapons start strong but can't be powered up as much as others; fortunately you can power up one weapon while using another. Extra lives, shield enhancements and a smart bomb are also on offer. 

Along with the standard levels, there are also 4 tunnel levels, which involve shooting what you can and dodging everything else as you dart through a ray-traced 3D tunnel, and 2 optional Thrust-style bonus levels in which lives can be won or lost.

		<desc>A long time ago, a great empire comprised of Humans, Velox, Thrynn and Elowan ruled the stars. The Empire's currency was an energy source called Endurium. But something happened and this empire is no more. Furthermore, the small colony world named Arth has forgotten this heritage and technology. 1000 years have since passed and the people of Arth have rediscovered archaeological evidence of their empire. Using these discoveries, they create spaceships and form the Interstel corporation to govern the fleet. It's time to take the first steps back into space... but could it be the same enemy that destroyed the Empire still exists?

Starflight is a space exploration game. The player must first form a crew, assign their positions and customize the spaceship before blasting off from spacedock. Once out into space, the standard interface allows access to different crew members and navigation. The entire galaxy is unknown and it's up to the player to travel to distant planets to explore and land on them. Using a top-down interface, a planetary lander will venture out with the task of  finding minerals and biological data to transport back to Starport. These resources can then be used to train crew members and improve the ship. Different alien races control the galaxy and it will be up to the player to engage them diplomatically or engage them in combat. Successful exploration of the galaxy and alien cultures will yield clues and new leads as to the fate of the Empire.

		<desc>The Planet Novenia has been attacked by the Egrons, who snuck in by disguising their craft as the protected Starglider species, which Novenia's automated defenses were programmed not to shoot. 

Your task is to fight them off using only an obsolete Airborne Ground Attack Vehicle. This was designed as the ultimate combat machine, with sophisticated hardware up to Draziw Yarg's high standards. It has a fully-rechargeable shield, plasma drive unit, an inbuilt scanner and 10,000-sector map, a top speed of 2550 Urads and two homing missiles.

The game is viewed from within AGAV's cockpit, with control over speed, weapon targeting and firing. There are several control options to decide exactly how the craft works, with fixed or floating sighting, and the option of automatic centering, allowing you to balance the game between easy sighting and advanced shooting ranges.

Repair depots must be visited frequently, as they can refill the weapon bays as well as repairing the ship. Crucially, the Egron Stargliders need 3 missiles to shoot down, so at least 1 visit to a depot is required to complete this job, at which point you move up to the next, harder, level.

		<name>Storm Master</name>
		<desc>Storm Master is a 1991 video game for the Amiga, Atari ST and PC, produced by the now-defunct French developer Silmarils, which placed the player as the head of government for a fictional semi-medieval country.

Similarly to most of the games produced by Silmarils, Storm Master took place on a European-fantasy world. Gameplay revolved around the governance and management of the country of Eolia in an ongoing war against its neighbour, Shaarkania, with the ultimate goal of sacking (and, by inference, destroying) all enemy cities.[1][2]

The game was notable for a blend of turn-based strategy interspersed with live-action battles. This took the form of aerial battles against enemy air fleets or air defences and required the player to launch ballistic missiles against enemy ships or batteries. Other real-time elements of the game involved the player conducting a religious ceremony with the goal of increasing the natural wind energy of the nation. This element of gameplay was further enhanced by requiring the player to dispatch government ministers around the country to develop or industrialise various aspects of the state. The game was further noted by Amiga Action as having an innovative 'advance through time' feature, allowing the player some control over the rate at which time passed in the game.</desc>

The action is viewed from within the car throughout the 3-lap races, with the distance between you always on screen.

Jump chasms, jumps, and drawbridges; take banks hard or slow; pass your opponent on the track or while catching mass air. Your car has the ability to burn a limited amount of turbo boost fuel as a way to accelerate faster and achieve higher speeds, but don't use it all up at once or you'll fall behind. Don't damage your engine too much; severe dents will show up during your next race.

Whatever you do, don't fall off the track, as this will cost you time as you are placed back on.</desc>

		<desc>Super C, a port of the classic 1988 Konami arcade game Super Contra.

Like in the original Contra, the game can be played by up to two players simultaneously. The left player controls Bill (who wears green in this installment), while the right player controls Lance (who wears purple). The game retains the side-scrolling format from the previous game, discarding only the pseudo-3D and fixed screen segments. Instead, Super Contra features vertically-scrolling stages played from an overhead perspective, in which the player can move in eight directions. The controls remain mostly the same during the side-scrolling segments, with the only difference is that the player can now control the height of his jump by holding the joystick upwards or downwards while pressing the jump button.

The player can replace their default gun with one of four possible weapons by destroying the flying item capsules that appear throughout each stage. The available weapons include a machine gun, a spread gun, a bomb gun and a laser gun. This time, weapons can now be upgraded by picking up the same power-up twice in a row, resulting in greater destructive power. The power-ups in Super Contra are represented by the actual guns the player's character wields instead of the Falcon-shaped letter icons from the previous game. During overhead stages, the player can also pick up a "hyper shell" item that destroys all on-screen enemies, which is launched by pressing the jump button. The hyper shell can be launched at any time during these stages and the player can store more than one at a time.

The game consists of five stages, which are set in a military base, a jungle and the alien's lair. Stages 1, 3 and 4 are played from the standard side-scrolling perspective, while Stages 2 and 5 employ the top-down perspective. Throughout each stage, the player must fight his way through the enemy's line of defense (including a few mid-bosses) until reaching the final target awaiting at the end.

After running out of lives, the player is allowed to continue up to five times before the game is entirely over; this depends on the DIP switch settings. Unlike the predecessor, each player can now continue at any time, with no need to wait until the other player runs out of lives.[2]</desc>

		<name>Super Cars II</name>
		<desc>The follow up to Magnetic Fields' earlier racing game develops the format in several ways. As before, the racing is overhead view and against a field of 9 computer cars, with championship points awarded for finishing positions. The computer drivers now take on the humourous names from Lotus 1, such as 'Ayrton Sendup' and 'T Hairy Bootson'. The most noticeable addition is a split screen 2 player mode. 

The power ups have been changed around from the original, with the handling improvements gone, so as to put more of an emphasis on learning to control the slippery cars. These have been replaced by further weapons and more engine upgrades.

The questions from the original have been replaced by mock driving test questions about stopping distances and the like - as before, money and points are won and lost depending on your answers.

		<name>Super Hang-On</name>
		<desc>This is a conversion of Sega's popular motorcycle racing arcade game.  In this game you race a motorcycle around the world, completing each section of track within a time limit. There are other bikes on the road, but beating this is not important, so they can be thought of as moving obstacles. Each continent is a different difficulty level: Africa is beginner, Asia is junior, the Americas are senior, and Europe is expert.  

This is a very simple and straightforward game, viewed from behind the bike in 2D (so the screen does not tilt with the bike). The right/left controls are steering, and up/down are gear changes. Your cycle is always moving, and your speed strictly depends on the gear you are in, although contact or running off the road slows the bike down.

		<desc>Thirty levels of boulder-blasting await in this platform shoot em up, which can be thought of as Pang meets Turrican. The levels start with varying amounts of boulders, and as soon as you shoot at one of them, it breaks up into 2 more which are half the size. Eventually they become small enough that they disappear. 

Your character is a human sprite, so youre bound to the ground unless you can jump onto one of the strategically-placed ledges. There are several different weapons available, which you dont lose when you die.

There are numerous different control options  the standard one involves always firing in the direction youre aiming, but others include one where your firing direction can be changed by flicking the joystick with fire held down, an option where you move using the main 4 directions and use the bottom-left and bottom-right diagonal to rotate the firing direction, and an option where you use one joystick for direction of movement, and the other for direction of fire.

Switchblade II is a side-scrolling platform action game. One key aspect of the game is obtaining coins from defeated enemies, which can be traded at shops for extra lives, energy, and weapons.

A sequel to Switchblade, Switchblade II is an action-platformer. The action is viewed from the side. The player guides the protagonist, Hiro, through six levels infested with mechanoid, metal-clad enemies. Weapons include a knife, homing missiles, a laser beam, a flame thrower and shuriken.

Although the game was developed in the UK, its graphics had a distinctly Japanese style, similar to manga.</desc>

The gameplay is platform and ladders based, set both inside and outside. The layout of the territories becomes visible as you progress, and they can contain bonus weapons and secret rooms. Unlike the sequel you start without weaponry, and this is gained directly, rather than you collecting coins and trading them at shop sections. Holding down fire progressively builds up your fighting power.

One player controlled a helicopter and the other a jeep, with the jeep transforming into a boat when the vehicles passed over water. As well as a host of blaster fodder the game also included a mid-level enemy inspired by the "Goose" enemy from the earlier title Silkworm. Pieces of this enemy would fly onto the screen and assemble into one vehicle before commencing to fire at the players' vehicles. When destroyed the "goose" would drop power-ups.

		<desc>In the future, the world is controlled by a handful of global corporations (syndicates).  You are the Marketing director (hit man) for one of these companies.  It is your job to take control away from the competitors.  The job is not one of diplomacy, but one of brute force and physical control.  Advance your way to the top of the corporation by successfully completing your missions and managing the money you make from your territories.

The gameplay is visually reminiscent of X-Com, with an angled top-down perspective, but it is real time rather than turn based. You have missions ranging from infiltrate and capture, to seek and destroy. In each of these you direct a team of four agents as they move through the world shooting at anything that gets in their way.

You can upgrade and modify your agents, as well as equip them with tools you have researched or liberated from opposing syndicates.  As you complete missions, you gain more funds to use for purchasing agents or researching upgrades and equipment.

Spit in my eye, eh? Isn't the world a small place guv'nor? Well, yeah, it is a small place and that is why T'ngl-y-wd isn't on it Ã¢â¬â actually. It's a 'small undistinguished planet in a remote galaxy'. Arthur didn't worry about it much until he found out that it contained some pretty valuable stones, then he shot his mouth off over a couple of pints of beer and was elbowed out by the mining company. Yup, those nice men at the mining centre have hidden Arthur's documents and re-established the planet's operational base. There's a court case in ten days and Arthur (sounds a bit like my uncle, Ripperbile) needs to find those papers or he's out on his ear.

This is definitely an arcade-style adventure weighted towards the arcade. You might find the puzzles pretty devious, but it's all a question of having the right thing at the right time. If you like your adventures grilled and ready to eat you probably won't find Tanglewood instantly appealing. You could spend ages exploring this deep and mysterious world Ã¢â¬â there must be some juicy titbits somewhere Ã¢â¬â but it takes so long to get anywhere that you might decide to throw your disk over the nearest bridge and cut your toenails instead. But watch out Ã¢â¬â you might start enjoying yourself!</desc>

		<name>Tearaway Thomas</name>
		<desc>You control Thomas, a strange-looking but vaguely cutesy animal of some description in an ultra-fast platform game. There are 50 levels, split into 5 groups of 10.

Each one has a certain number of gems, and your task is to collect a certain number of them (for example, level 2 has 55 and you need at least 40) and then find the exit, all within the time limits. The yellow gems are worth 50 points and the purple ones 100, although the purple ones donÃ¢â¬â¢t appear to be more precariously-placed, and the total makes no distinction, so this is for colour as much as anything. Once youÃ¢â¬â¢ve got the required amount, the gems double in value, tempting you to continue to explore

The levels are infested with cutesy-looking baddies, such as birds and bears, which canÃ¢â¬â¢t be killed, and must be avoided, as contact with them costs you time as Thomas picks himself up. You can jump on the heads of some of them, which gives a small points bonuses. The layouts include ropes to ascend, moving platforms and more. Some levels are entirely vertically-scrolling, seeing you progress up the ledges of a tree or similar.

If you run out of time you lose a life, but the level isnÃ¢â¬â¢t reset, so you keep the number of gems collected and have a fresh set of time. This means that you are far less likely to lose a second life on the level, similarly to Chase HQ.</desc>

		<name>Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles : The Coin-Op!</name>
		<desc>The game, surprisingly enough, is a horizontally scrolling beatÃ¢â¬â¢em-up affair. Not very innovative I know, yet itÃ¢â¬â¢s a tried and tested theme that proves very popular with younger people. Personally, I wouldnÃ¢â¬â¢t touch the coin-op, or any other tedious beatÃ¢â¬â¢em-up for that matter, with a barge pole.

The game begins from a small selection screen. That is, either one or two players can choose which particular Turtle character theyÃ¢â¬â¢d most like to take control of.  A short and tacky intro sequence follows and then the fun really begins. The main aim of the game is to rescue April OÃ¢â¬â¢Neil, a top TV news reporter in New York. It just so happens that the evil Foot Clan who kidnapped her in the original game, have repeated this outrageous crime. Our heroes must battle their way through hoards of adversaries using their weapon and of course, a number of bread and butter Turtle actions. Each move is joystick controlled. As the levels progress, the baddies begin to carry weapons and throw lethal objects in the general direction of the Turtles.

This game consists of little more than moving your character into position and endlessly pressing the fire button. In conversion terms this is also very poor. The graphics bear little resemblance to their crisply defined arcade counterparts, and the sound is simply awful when compared to the likes of First Samurai.</desc>

Play as all four of the turtle heroes, rescue April, and then rescue your sensei Splinter from Mecha-Turtles clutches than go after The Shredder deep in the bowels of The Technodrome itself.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is an action game based on the late eighties/early nineties cartoon series of the same name. Play as Leonardo, Michaelangelo, Donatello and Raphael (one turtle only, but the ability to swap between turtles at any time) as you save your friends and battle The Shredder and his cronies. There are no 'lives', as such - when you lose a turtle, he becomes 'captured', and you cannot use him again until you rescue him from a place hidden in the overworld.

Gameplay takes place in two perspectives: a top-down view, which lets you run around and explore buildings, sewers and other places. When entering places from the top-down view, the perspective shifts to a side-scrolling view, where most of the battling takes place. In addition to each turtle's main weapon, sub-weapons (such as shuriken) can be acquired, to use at foes - these have a limited use.

		<name>Terrorpods</name>
		<desc>Just because a region is bleak, desolate and inhospitable doesn't mean it lacks value. The planet Colian is a case in point; it has plentiful stocks of tough metal Aluma, the explosive Detonite, and the energy giving Quaza crystals. The units which are mining them are under the control of the Empire, and are forced to produce destructive Terrorpod units.

The rival Federation attempts to shut this operation down, and sends you to the surface in a Defence Strategy Vehicle. Your task is to find each of the six bases before the Empire can destroy evidence of them. Destroy all the Terrorpods in order to reach the bases.

The action is viewed from your DSV, as you move and shoot at any encroaching Terrorpods. Colian has a heavy inertia field, so you are always moving. You have guided missiles at your disposal, although these use up some of your limited Detonite stocks. Missiles will also be aimed at you; avoid these.

As all this action unfolds, you are trying to ensure that enough components can be produced in the mines, and can be retrieved in order to go towards the Federation's own building efforts. Collect the resultant products to attach them to your DSV.

The game takes place towards the end of the movie: the Addams Family has been evicted from their home by a court order issued by a backstabbing attorney (there's one for the books), Tully Alford. Even worse, the other Addamses: Morticia, Pugsley, Wednesday, Granny and Lurch have gone missing.

As Gomez, you must tour the Addams mansion in search of your lost family, battling out mysterious monsters and evading traps, and eventually face your nemesis, Tully.

		<name>The Adventures of Willy Beamish</name>
		<desc>Willy Beamish is a kid who likes to goof off and have fun. Naturally all the grown-ups get in the way by making him go to school, making him clean his room, etc. But now that's school's out for the summer, Willy is determined to have a good time and maybe even have his pet frog win the frog jumping contest. However Willy has a habit of getting into trouble, and naturally that means it will be a challenge to get out of it.

The Adventures of Willy Beamish is a point-and-click graphical adventure. You play Willy Beamish, an eight year-old kid who is just trying to get through life without losing his lunch money. But he'll have to deal with parents, teachers, babysitters and bratty sisters. The player must solve different puzzles to ensure Willy can progress, get out of trouble and generally avoid ending up grounded. 

The in-game time progresses even if no action is taken. This means many puzzles have to be solved in a certain time frame or rely on being in the right place at the right time. A special aspect of this game is a bar which shows Willy's relationship to his parents. It gets affected by the way certain situations are resolved, e.g. it increases if Willy refuses to play with his sister, and when it is full they send Willy to a military school and the game is lost.

		<desc>The small country town Skara Brae was enjoying a peaceful life, until an evil wizard known as Mangar the Dark appeared. Monsters have invaded the town, terrorizing its inhabitants. Mangar cast the spell of Eternal Winter on the surroundings, isolating Skara Brae from any possible help. Guards that were entrusted with the task of protecting the town have disappeared within one night. Only a party of brave adventurers can save Skara Brae and defeat Mangar. 

The Bard's Tale is a fantasy role-playing game similar to Wizardry games, with first-person exploration of pseudo-3D maze-like environments, and turn-based combat against randomly appearing enemies. Unlike early Wizardry installments, the town can be explored physically, and parts of the overworld are accessible as well. Several dungeons must be explored before the player can tackle the final quest.

Six character classes are available when the player is prompted to create a party of six adventurers in the beginning of the game: Bard, Hunter, Monk, Paladin, Rogue, Warrior, Magician, and Conjurer. The last two can be promoted when specific conditions are met during gameplay. The bard class plays a special role, possessing magical songs that improves the party's performance in combat and are required to solve some of the game's puzzles.</desc>

		<desc>The Executioner is a Shooter game, developed by Avant Garde and published by Hawk, which was released in Europe in 1991.

This game is as original as Thrust, Gravitar, Choplifter and Olds. Prettier, perhaps, with some extra bells and whistles but essentially the same. ThereÃ¢â¬â¢s absolutely nothing wrong with taking a great idea, improving and developing It. But with this game itÃ¢â¬â¢s hard to see where the improvements have been carried out. ThatÃ¢â¬â¢s sad, especially when you look at some of the other games recently released, such as Utopia, Megalomania and Magic Pockets. All three have taken a tried and trusted game formula and pushed it one step further by enhancing the gameplay, and adding something fresh and exciting.

There are really too many better games to buy with your money. Sorry, but thereÃ¢â¬â¢s no way this Executioner is a killer.</desc>

		<name>The Immortal</name>
		<desc>The Immortal is an isometric action-adventure game.

Your old mentor Mordamir has disappeared. Probably kidnapped. You're not too sure where he might be, but a dungeon is always a good place to look, so you seek out the nearest one and plunge into its depths. Beware: 8 levels of 
isometric death await.

The Immortal is the prototype of a trial-and-error game. Progress is made by encountering a hazard, dying, solving the problem, encountering the next hazard. To solve a level, you have to know its traps and their patterns by heart. As frustrating as this may sound (it is), The Immortal quite cleverly balances annoyance with curiosity and graphical rewards. In short: You want to see what challenge lies in the next room.

The puzzles range from simple avoidance of traps to the correct use of items; you collect objects in an inventory. Every now and then, The Immortal surprises with a special challenge. For example, you've got to ride a magic carpet through a hallway full of fire traps, or ride a barrel on an underground river. The dungeon isn't empty: some friedlies may have valuable information or trade items, the nasty sort of guys will attack. Combat is fought man-to-man on a special screen. Your adversary indicates his next attack a few seconds before he executes it, so you've got time to react appropriately. You can dodge to the left or the right, as well as attack from these two directions. There is no save option in the game, of course, but you may restart each level as often as you like. Levels can be skipped by entering passwords.

This hovers around the middle of the skyscrapers, creating a claustrophobic low level experience (and a different feel to the many other flight simulations set in the city, such as F/A-18 Interceptor). 

In this maelstrom, the Black Angel gang is terrorising the public. The player is a member of the SFPD Police force, charged with bringing them down throughout ten missions. Some are out-and-out action while others are more strategic. You can only survive for 20 minutes in the smog, so time is crucial in these missions.

In addition to outflying the enemy on your hoverbike, the player must carefully pre-position ground forces to arrest him when he is brought down, using Pick-Up Pods. Once arrested, a suspect must be interrogated to release enough information to know what the next threat is.</desc>

For the entertainment of the futuristic masses, you play a criminal that has been inserted into a mechanical body with the promise that if you succeed in surviving through all the levels (there are many and they are hard), you will be set free.
   You start each level at the bottom, near pooling liquid which will soon rise, at your immediate peril. Navigate the level from bottom to the exit at the top before the liquid rises and kills you. There are many other foes that fly around, causing you damage and basically annoying you to spit.
   Most levels must be navigated through a series of keyed gates, doors, or portals. These shaped keys are scattered around the map and must by picked up and used only on the gates they match individually.
   Twist: You can only carry one special weapon (triple shot, laser beam, or vertical shot) and one tool (key, liquid-freeze, or a red herring) at a time.
   This game requires a lot of memorization of enemy movement patterns and optimum routes.
   A unique feature is that when you die, you can watch a replay and take over at any point to continue your game.
   You can also hit the HELP button at the start of each level to view a map, helping you plan your route.

The three Vikings will have to combine their unique skills to defeat Tomator, as well as a vast array of aliens, robots, giant snails, big lizards and more.

The Lost Vikings is a side-scrolling platform puzzle game with a twist. Instead of one character who can jump, run, shoot, collect items, flip switches and so on, there are three different characters, each with his own skills. Eric the Swift can jump, run and bash through walls with his tough helmet. Olaf the Stout has a shield which can block attacks, function as an air glider or as a step to stand on. Baleog the Fierce can shoot things with his arrows (including switches) or kill things with his sword. The player has to use the three Vikings as a team if he wants to get past the increasingly difficult levels and puzzles.

The player controls one Viking at a time, but can switch between them at any point. The Vikings have limited space in their inventory which they can use to keep various items. Each Viking has three health points, and if he loses them all from confrontations with dangers, he dies (some threats kill instantly), and the level must be restarted.

		<name>The New Zealand Story</name>
		<desc>One day, a kiwi tribe was having fun and games outside the zoo, only to be kidnapped by the evil-minded Leopard Seal, who plans to sell them at the black market. Fortunately, during the kidnapping process, Tiki, leader of the tribe, managed to escape the sack, and her job is to rescue Phee-Phee and the other kiwis scattered around New Zealand, and are held in cages in various locations that include Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook. 

If Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs. 

In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen  meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.

		<desc>Two player side scrolling beat-em-up converted from the Taito coin-op that featured three monitor screens side by side. The Amiga version was developed in letterbox format in order to show as much of the wide screen background graphics as possible. 

The player(s) controlled robot Ninjas, which battled their way through the levels using Shuriken and knives. As the Ninja's took damage their classic Ninja garb was torn away to reveal robotic limbs, torso or head. When the damage reached critical the Ninja Robot would explode, scattering mechanical body parts.

As with The Sales Curve's later title SWIV, The Ninja Warriors used the company's Dynamic Loading System to load sprites, sound and background graphics from disk on the fly.

		<desc>After the success of the Ghostbusters film (and indeed of the licensed game from Activision) a cartoon TV series was created, which this converted Data East arcade game is based on. You control a Ghostbuster, who has 10 levels full of ghosts to clear up.

This is done by first shooting the ghosts using a gun, and then by using a photon beam (by holding down the fire button) to suck them in for storage in the backpack. Photon recharges can be collected, as can the potential for an improved shot, as well as a shield. The Ghostbusters mascot Slimer also appears as a power-up, which hovers around your character killing ghosts on contact.

To solve the game the player has to explore the (shortened) town and solve a few basic puzzles which are partly not present in the full version of the game. He also needs to chat with several persons known from the game which all have new dialogue, e.g. the voodoo lady talks about some features of the commercial version and Guybrush constantly cracks jokes about this being a demo.

The game uses the same control scheme as the most Lucasfilm adventures at the time. On the bottom of the screen are nine verbs displayed. The player clicks on of these verbs and then on an item in the game world to issue a command, e.g. picking something up.

To travel a "robot hull" must be created on a visible square then teleported to, making sure you absorb your old hull to avoid losing energy. Boulders and trees can also be created, trees to block The Sentinels view and boulders can be stacked to gain higher ground.</desc>

		<desc>You can keep your Retaliators and keep your supersonic high altitude bombers. What you really want are good ol' Spitfires and Messerschmitts to go dogfighting in Ã¢â¬â or so Lucasfilm will have us believe in their follow up to the great Battlehawks 1942. Anyone with even a basic knowledge of recent British history will recognise the immortal words used in the title, so it is no shock to find out that this game is a combat flight sim based on aircraft that were around in the first half of the Second World War.

First of all, you can decide which side to fight for, but remember the decision here limits which craft are available to fly Ã¢â¬â no Spitfires in the Luftwaffe! The Brits have got Hurricanes and Spits to fight in while the German have not only fighters, but medium and long range bombers and dive bombers. Each plane has several missions set aside for it that can be played in any order. The missions are varied and range from straight dogfights to scramble and intercept missions. Once a mission is completed the combat records are updated and stored to disk.

Then there are the campaign games if you feel like playing for a long while, where you take charge of your side's airforce and try to either bomb the blazes out of blighty or not, depending which side you are on.</desc>

		<desc>Dominating the exciting world of Theme Park ownership is your goal in this strategy game from Bullfrog. The first task is to set up your rides within the available land, structuring convenient paths and queues and ideally leaving some space for bigger rides once they become available, and include some lakes and trees to increase the park's allure. Rides range from Teacups and Haunted Houses to the biggest most elaborate roller-coaster you can design, and water rides that loop around other rides.

Shops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and souvenirs - the cunning player will combine salt, sugar and caffeine settings to maximize consumer interest. Staff must be hired to keep everything running smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay.

You are competing against other Theme Parks, so don't let them get an advantage over you - monitor your success in attracting customers and financial viability closely using the supplied statistics pages. More important, ensure that research is adequately funded to produce new rides.

It can be played in three modes - Sandbox level lets you concentrate on the park design elements, while Sim and Full add more strategic features.

Featuring a low-angle isometric view (not compensated by the d-pad, meaning pressing right will move the player along the half-way line (his right), not in the direction of the right corner flag (the screens' right) like in most games featuring axonometric views, while buttons allow to pass the ball in different strengths or kick at goal. Managing is limited to the choice of eight different formations at the start of the game and half-time.

Options include the usual in the genre: half length (3,5,10,20 and 45 minutes), weather conditions (sunny, rainy, overcast, indoors), referee strictness (full, no cards, no fouls), time stoppages, tie decision (shootout or overtime) and sound (music and sfx, only one of them or none).

You play a Troll roaming the levels in the hope of rescuing as many baby trolls as possible - each level gives you a set minimum to retrieve before you can leave via the Pigstop.

Initially you have no weapons, and contact with the nasties costs you energy, but a Yo-Yo can be collected, which can be used not only to kill enemies, but also to smash blocks away and open up paths, and even (with practice) tied to a ledge to allow you to swing across a gap. 

Throughout the levels you will find the letters B,O,N,U,S and G released from bonus balloons or on killing an enemy - if at the end of a level your letters spell out Bonus or Bogus you go to the appropriate extra level. The former has a chance to gain extra lives, the latter must be escaped quickly to avoid losing a life.

		<name>Turrican II : The Final Fight</name>
		<desc>Turrican II: The Final Fight is a platformer/shooter as typically seen on consoles, but designed for home computers from the ground up.

Its plot is - naturally - very simple: an evil mega-robot called The Machine attacks the United Planets Ship Avalon 1, slaughtering all who resist. All - except Bren McGuire, who manages to escape and slips into the experimental Turrican bionic armor. As Turrican, he strives to show The Machine who's the boss.

Unlike other games of its type, this game contains three levels of horizontal shooter action in the spirit of R-Type or the developers' own Katakis. Six large worlds are to be explored, where you are basically free to go everywhere you want, since there is no automatic scrolling and the levels are packed with hidden extra lives and weapons. All those levels are very different: the first one in the rock desert is pretty colorful with parallaxing rainbow background and happy music, while the following worlds get darker and darker.</desc>

		<desc>Three-headed demon Morgul has been influencing people's dreams to create nightmares, but more recently these nightmares have become real. Only Turrican can save them in this fast paced side scrolling shoot-em up. It features 5 worlds and 13 levels of challenging gameplay.

Gameplay is conceptually simple: just jump, shoot and explore. However, this game puts a lot of emphasis on finding and using the 10 different weapons Turrican can collect.

Unreal is made up of 8 levels and contains a mixture of 2D and 3D graphics.  The environment is also completely interactive - you can run up and down hills and slide through the snow but you have to be careful to not fall of the top of a cliff.

On each level you will be faced with puzzles and battles and you need to get the high score you pass to the next level.  If your health reaches zero you will die and the game is over.  Fortunately, your health is replenished at the end of each level.

		<desc>Re-enter your manta in the sequel to one of the fastest 8-bit action games. You are sent out to take out half a dozen enemy battle groups, each consisting of four huge spaceships. Similar to the first Uridium, you face increasing numbers of unfriendly fighter wings and stationary defenses while sweeping over the carriers. The real challenge here is to avoid the many walls on the back of the vessel while you are under attack.
After the exterior has been cleaned from most of the enemy presence you take care of the ships' reactor core in a jump-and-run-like sequence. While floating in a non-gravity surrounding, lower the core's shields and then destroy it.
The game also gives you a number of extra weapons that can be collected by either flying over pick-ups left from dead enemy wings or by catching them after the power generator has been destroyed.

The game is a top-down adventure using a joystick- and icon-based control system. When you walk up to an object you wish to investigate, press fire to gain access to the icons at the bottom of the screen, with which you can look at, pick up or use an object. There are also people who will talk to you.

And I mean 'talk' - the game is full of speech for every action, including your character saying things such as "There's nothing here" and "I can't do that" in response to each instruction. Each level has one disk's worth of speech, and there's no disk swapping during the game.

The level designs include hidden holes in the floor, but there are maps to locate these.

The field of battle is a toroidal grid on which your tri-colored half-sphere base cells sit awaiting your protection.  The invading cells (also tri-colored spheres) attempt to bond together into groups and destroy your bases.  You destroy the infecting cells by lobbing antibodies (also tri-colored spheres) at them.  Hit an infector with the right color shot and it is destroyed.  The catch is that you have a limited amount of each color of ammunition.  Run out of a color and the game is over.  The situation is also complicated by Spitters, enemies that appear and spew out new attacking cells if you take too long to complete a level.

		<name>Volfied</name>
		<desc>Volfied is a home conversion of an arcade coin-op developed by Taito in the late '80s. The game is very similar to Qix -- the player takes control of an object whose purpose is to roam the screen, forming shapes and removing them from the play field. By way of reward, a picture is gradually revealed in the removed areas of the screen. The borders of the area which the player has not cleared become the border of the area the player's pointer can move along.

The player's object must avoid contact with any of the enemies which float around the screen, as this will weaken and eventually destroy it. Barriers limit which parts of the border boxes can be formed through. The goal is to clear 80% or more of the screen, and each additional percent adds bonus points.

As an arcade conversion this game allows for one or two player games in three difficulty levels, but offers no passwords or saved games across its numerous levels.

Voyager is viewed from on board the craft, and is a first person shoot 'em up using polygon graphics. You start with a laser and a few bombs, but can collect extra weaponry and the ability to fly through the mothership. Not all enemies can be killed simply by shooting them, so there is a tactical element to the slaughter.

in the rectangular playground. But Welltris changes this rectangular arena into a four
sided well with grid-like walls and bottom where the falling pieces can be moved from 
wall to wall within the well. Form the pieces into solid rows either horizontally or vertically
on the bottom of the well.

You're a 2nd Lieutenant just out of the Academy, with some good work under your belt. You're posted to Tiger's Claw, the flagship of the Confederation Fleet.  Will you help the Confederation to victory, or go down in infamy? 

Wing Commander is a space combat simulator interspersed with shipboard dialogs. Onboard the ship, you can save/load game, visit the bar to get the latest gossip, or go on to the next mission briefing, and the 3D space combat part. 

The 3D space combat have you sitting in the cockpit, where you control the craft like roll, turn, up/down, afterburner, as well as fire guns and launch missiles. There are four different crafts on the Confed side, each with different flight characteristics and armament. You will have a wingman on each mission, and you should keep the wingman alive as the wingman will help you if you issue the right orders. You can also taunt the enemy. You'll be fighting several different types of enemy fighters and capital ships, and even combat a few Kilrathi aces. 

When the mission is complete, land back onboard the ship and get ready for the next one. The campaign tree have both winning and losing paths. 

Wing Commander featured a hybrid bitmap/3D graphics  engine that allowed even 286's to display detailed 3D graphics to an extent never before possible. With EMS available, it can display even more detailed graphics and in-cockpit animations.

		<desc>Before the long-running Links series, Access produced the Leader Board lineage, which concludes here. Wind, snap and power are the main considerations as you dodge the bunkers, water and rough which make for more complex courses than the 8-bit versions of the original.

A course editor is provided.  The courses provided include real courses like St. Andrews, a fictional designs such as The Gauntlet, which as the name suggests is designed to push your skills to the maximum.

The PC version revolutionized the use of the PC speaker to reproduce voice samples via their patented "RealSound" process. Quips like "No doubt about it, he's deep in the sandtrap", "Straight onto the fairway", and "Looks like he hit the tree, Jim." are used to provide running commentary on the gameplay.

Players can compete either against computer-controlled Worms or against each other. 

The weapons are more extensive (and destructive) than in the previous game, including the first appearances of the Kenny-on-a-Rope, Concrete Donkey, Priceless Ming Vase, Old Woman and Holy Hand Grenade. Also included is a level editor that allows players to create their own battlefields.</desc>

		<name>Xenon</name>
		<desc>Xenon is the obscure and mysterious predecessor to the much better known Xenon 2: Megablast. The game is actually nothing like its sequel, with completely different control scheme and gameplay. The plot overlaps however, with the Xenites making their first attempt to control the galaxy.

Xenon is essentially an overhead shooter, where the player controls the ship and moves around the screen. However, the difference between Xenon and its sequel is that here the player actually controls the movement of the playfield (up or down) by simply moving the ship in the direction of choice. To do this in the sequel, players need to slam your ship against the bottom of the screen and pull back on the stick in order to reverse-scroll the playfield.

It also features a 3D playfield (some enemies, for example, will be mounted on hills of sort, where players can't shoot them). To combat these the player can transform its tank into a plane. The game then switches to the more familiar gameplay style as seen in other vertically scrolling shooters. The plane has to transform back into a tank again to combat most ground units.

In Xenon, upgrades are taken from destroyed enemies.

		<desc>In principle, this is yet another (technically very impressive) horizontally scrolling shoot-'em-up. The interesting twist about the scenario is that it doesn't play in space like the similar game R-Type and most of its clones - instead, the fight between good and evil is underwater.

Through five levels, you have to shoot countless enemies, complete with the obligatory mid-level and end-level bosses. The most innovative part of this game comes after a level when you get to purchase new weapons - instead of simply buying upgrades, you can customize your ship by placing your new weapons anywhere on it.

		<desc>Xybots is either an unusually simple computer game or an unusually complex coin-op shoot 'em up, depending on your point of view. With either one or two players, you must move through a series of Gauntlet-style underground mazes, killing the bad guys and collecting health and other bonuses from flying saucers (underground? SLIGHT logic gap there, methinks).It's designed to be played co-operatively, although bullets from one player can harm the other.

The Xybots are out to stop you, of course, and many have advanced attack patterns as well as bullets to fire at you. Being able to view round corners is useful, allowing you to plan a strategy - often it's good to send one player forward and let the other play the waiting game, as in Gauntlet.

Based upon a psychadelic dream, Zak one day realizes that something is wrong -- Space Aliens are dumbifying the general public through the telephone system.  Zak must stop this, but he can't do it alone.  After finding a magic crystal (or some sort of crystal), Zak manages to get the help of Anthropologist, Annie, and her friends, Melissa and Leslie.  Between the four characters (all of which you control), you can destroy the dumbifying devices and save the earth.  Not too bad for a tabloid reporter.

You start with 3 strokes, but get the par for each hole added on, if you reach it in time -  run out of strokes, and your game is over.

		<desc>With a similar gameplay as the isometric Desert Strike, Zeewolf offers arcadesque helicopter-combat in a 3D-surrounding. Despite its mainly action-oriented gameplay, the 32 levels often involve support, transport and rescue missions - dropping or refueling friendly units in the combat zone, for example. In exchange, other units serve you as rearming points or help you fighting the enemy.

The order of the levels can be chosen freely and the game may be played with joystick or - a little unusual - with the mouse.
Although the range of sight is somewhat limited, the 3D graphics are very appealing and perform smoothly while playing. Here the game uses a 3rd person-engine looking at the helicopter from the side and displaying a certain amount of landmass in a square around it.

Zool 2 is a platform game where you control the titular "Ninja of the Nth Dimension" (or his girlfriend, Zooz, who can complete each level in a slightly different way) as he rampages through a variety of levels, collecting countless tasty treats, shooting any enemies that he encounters and finding bonuses (there's a variety of special power-ups Zool can find - for example, a bomb that follows him and can be blown up at any time to remove on-screen enemies, or a temporary invulnerability). New to the sequel is Zool's ability to scale walls and his new spinning attacks. 

On each level you have to collect a certain amount of the featured fruit within an allocated time limit, and then find the exit across the multi-directionally-scrolling levels. There are lots of hidden areas to see, including a bonus Breakout game starring Zool's pet 2-headed dog.

Whilst some shoot 'em ups are much easier with a second player, Z-Out takes design steps to legislate against this. In a 2-player game, most power-ups are unavailable, and even those which are only come into effect on level 3. Another variation is that the 1-player mode uses restart points, but the 2-player mode does not, so as to keep both players in the same place.

		<name>Déjà Vu : A Nightmare Comes True!</name>
		<desc>Deja Vu: A Nightmare Comes True!! is an Adventure game, developed by Pacesetter Laboratories and published by Mindscape, which was released in 1986.

Deja vu is a most unusual adventure, driven almost exclusively by joystick. Nevertheless, it is a text adventure, not an arcade adventure! Let me explain.
The screen consists of three main windows. The graphics window shows a pictorial representation of the current location. A window below it conveys the text narrative, plus any messages in response to commands like EXAMINE. The inventory window, to the right, is used to deposit objects shown in the graphics window that have been TAKEN. Above these windows is a collection of verb boxes, and below the inventory window is an exits window.

The plot is that of a mystery thriller. Finding yourself in the toilet cubicle of JoeÃ¢â¬â¢s Bar after closing time, you have suffered a total loss of memory. Locked doors prevent you from escaping, and soon you stumble upon a corpse in an upstairs office. His face is vaguely familiar, but you cannot quite place him. Are you being framed for the murder Ã¢â¬â or did you actually commit it? You do no know, and you cannot remember.

For something different, Deja vu is worth trying, and in any event, makes a worthwhile adventure</desc>

		<name>Gem'x</name>
		<desc>Like so many other puzzle games of the time, this game involves tiles of different colours, which must be manipulated to clear a succession of increasingly-difficult levels.

The basic idea is that you are presented with 2 sets of tiles, and must make the left one identical to the 'control' set on the right. The colours are defined in a sequence - red, green, blue, purple, yellow - and when you click on a tile, that tile's colour moves forward by two in that sequence (for example a blue one becomes yellow), whereas the tiles next to it move by one colour (for example, blue becomes purple). 

Any that move past the end fo the sequence disappear, causing surrounding blocks to drop. You get a limited number of moves, and limited time as well. Fortuantely there are passwords, delivered by cutely-drawn naked Japanese girls (although the private parts are covered up).

		<desc>Nuclear War is a single player turn-based strategy game developed by New World Computing and released for the Amiga in 1989 and later for MS-DOS. It presents a satirical, cartoonish nuclear battle between five world powers, in which the winner is whoever retains some population when everyone else on earth is dead.
The game's introduction includes an homage to Dr. Strangelove. Each player - one human, four computer-controlled - is represented by a caricature of a national leader (the MS-DOS version allowed more than one human player). If there is a computer-controlled winner at the end of the game, that leader is depicted jumping for joy in the middle of a blasted wasteland, crowing "I won! I won!". If the player wins only the high score board is shown. Once a player (computer or human) loses, all of their stockpiled weapons are automatically launched. It's possible for a game to have no winner because of this. If this happens, a cut scene of the earth shattering and exploding is shown, and the high score table appears (though without any new entries).</desc>

		<desc>This is it - the game that you've decided is the best Amiga game ever, and I must say it caught me by surprise. Sid Meier's conquest game is intriguing and addictive; challenging the player to evolve with their charge through the ages, from primitive man to present day and beyond. Hugely absorbing, the game sucks in the player and has been responsible for many late nights and bleary eyes. The recent re-issue on CD should ensure Civ stays at the top of the AR100 for a while yet.</desc>

		<name>Codename : Iceman</name>
		<desc>In the beginning of the 21st century, Earth is experiencing a global oil shortage. Surprisingly, Tunisia remains one of the few countries still in possession of large quantities of high-quality oil. USA and Soviet governments race each other in their attempts to purchase as much oil as possible. Finally, the Soviets take a step further and kidnap the US ambassador, hoping to provoke an international incident. Naval Officer Johnny Westland is sent to Tunisia with the order of rescuing the ambassador and preventing further escalation of the conflict.

Code-Name: Iceman is primarily an adventure game similar to Sierra's other works in that genre. The player navigates the protagonist in eight different directions from third-person view, and types text commands to interact with the environment. The command "Look" may be typed separately and lead to different text descriptions depending on where on screen the protagonist is positioned. The game is similar to Police Quest series in that it relies on realistic procedures, in this case military instructions, first aid, etc. The player may reach dead ends and resort to restoring an earlier save if some of these procedures are not followed properly. In addition, a considerable portion of the game consists of submarine simulation, requiring the player to navigate a submarine and fight enemy craft.</desc>

		<name>DreamWeb</name>
		<desc>Ryan, a bartender from a dystopian future can't sleep peacefully for months. His nights are sequences of nightmares and strange dreams, days with frequent black-outs with strange visions, until one night a figure in monk attire appears to him, and tells him the story of the seven evil ones, uniting to destroy to Dreamweb, the only barrier between the world and darkness. The monk makes a proposition: Ryan becomes the deliverer: the one who would keep the Dreamweb safe by killing those who try to destroy it.

Descending into paranoia and just wanting dreams to stop, Ryan accepts the mission, then wakes up in a puddle of cold sweat, next to his beloved girlfriend in her house, and late for work. Again.

DreamWeb is a top-down adventure game set in a gritty futuristic/dystopian city. Each location takes only a small portion of the screen without panning (except an optional small zoom window in the corner that follows the cursor), with the player interacting with objects and people by simply clicking them. Ryan has a limited inventory space, and as a lot of objects can be picked up (many without any use), the player must rationalize what might be useful and just filler. Dialogue is straight forward, with no options, but still required to advance in the game (to find new locations, for instance). In situations where many adventure games often feature an indirect approach to solve a  problem, Ryan often faces himself with situations where it's "killed or be killed", which result in deaths  (sometimes of innocents).

The story isn't much developed inside the game, but the original release of the game included Diary Of a (Mad?) Man, a 40-page diary telling the descent of Ryan into madness, or his destiny, written by Stephen Marley provides a complete background to the events leading to the start of the game.

		<name>King's Quest : Quest for the Crown</name>
		<desc>Being fairly young in gaming years, to me Kings Quest I seems very basic especially by todayÃ¢â¬â¢s standards. But IÃ¢â¬â¢m sure there are those of you out there who remember the good olÃ¢â¬â¢ days of RPGs, having to type in the commands for your hero, spending hours trying to find another word for Ã¢â¬ËwalkÃ¢â¬â¢ because your computer is having one of his pedantic days and waiting on eternity for each screen to load when your character moves from one area to another. Well, I bet some of the more nostalgic among you are now saying Ã¢â¬ËHey, I remember those old classicsÃ¢â¬â¢ - and Kings Quest I is definitely one of them.

The King of Daventry is on his last legs, and you, as his favourite Knight Sir Graham, need to retrieve three missing treasures to restore Daventry to its former glory and be rewarded with the crown. For your money you get some reasonable graphics, and some nice effects such as birds tweeting in the background, monsters splashing in the moat and waterfall.

Controlling the game is relatively easy, type in whatever instruction you wish your character to carry out and the computer will either let you do this or suggest that you try something else.

If youÃ¢â¬â¢re a real RPG fan then itÃ¢â¬â¢s worth a look. The game isnÃ¢â¬â¢t too bad, but at the moment there are far more original and impressive adventure games around, and it canÃ¢â¬â¢t compete with todayÃ¢â¬â¢s high standards.</desc>

		<desc>This sequel to Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge is again a behind-the-car viewed racing game. It takes in eight distinct circuits, adding surface and weather effects such as desert and snow. Later in the game, you must race through two-way motorways with oncoming traffic, (incorporating civilian cars and trucks), and face tough levels aided by speed and time boost pick-ups.

You are no longer racing directly against other cars or over laps; instead, racing is on time as you have limited time to reach each checkpoint.  Reaching each of these extends your time, and any remaining time is turned into bonus points if you successfully complete the track.

You have two cars at your disposal, which the game chooses automatically for each level, hence the loss of the word 'Esprit' from the title. The Lotus Esprit form the original is joined by a Lotus Elan convertible, which is slower but has better grip. 

You can play through the set of tracks either full-screen or in split-screen mode with another player. On Amiga and ST the game allows you to link two machines, each of which can have two human players. If one player successfully completes one of the 8 courses, all players can continue onto the next one.

A typical Sierra parser game built with the popular AGI engine, Police Quest differs from the others release by the company in the realism of the setting and travelling, that is done by car, controlled by the player using a overhead view (instead of the cabbie of Leisure Suit Larry or walking around in Space Quest). Some sections of the game require the player to be efficient driving the car (as there are a fair number of chases, and traffic rules also apply to the player).</desc>

		<name>Rise of the Dragon</name>
		<desc>The year is 2053, and Los Angeles has turned into a grim place ruled by crime and corruption. William 'Blade' Hunter is a private detective who once was a police officer. He is asked to investigate a horrible murder of the mayor's daughter, whose body was mutilated. As Hunter begins to search for clues that would help him solve the crime, he uncovers a conspiracy involving a deadly drug and a powerful criminal syndicate behind it.

Rise of the Dragon is a futuristic first-person adventure game. The game's visuals are reminiscent of a comic book, with digitized photos of actors and hand-painted backgrounds. Unlike most other adventure games of the time, it relies less on inventory puzzles and more on specific choices made by the player. The game has an internal clock and requires the player to plan the protagonist's moves ahead in order to be in the right place at the right time. Dialogues with multiple choices are utilized as a gameplay tool; a wrong choice will often lead to a premature end of the adventure.

There are two side-scrolling action sequences in the game; both can be bypassed without penalty if the player character dies several times in a row. The Sega CD version does not allow the player to skip these sequences. In addition, it uses a different color palette with a greenish tint, and has voice-overs for the dialogues.</desc>

		<desc>Six years after its first appearance, the classic sci-fi send-up is back with a vengeance. Equipped with an all-mouse game system, and shrill Nineties graphics is sets out to enrapture the next generation of players.

Prepare to save the world, well Xenon, our hero's home planet, as Roger Wilco tumbles into The Sarien Encounter. Inconveniently for Roger - he's in the middle of a nap - the universe has chosen this exact moment to begin falling apart. No more sleep for Roger.

Full to the brim with Hitchhiker-type humour, it puts the threadbare fabric of recent adventures to shame. It should be an integral part of every ambitious collection, if you have an A3000. Everyone else will be sorely tired by long loading sessions, slow animation and gritty graphics. Sci-fi fanatics must play it, others still can, though Sierra should do their homework and deliver versions that are as much fun on a standard Amiga because they deserve to remain classics.</desc>

Through five levels, you have to shoot countless enemies, complete with the obligatory mid-level and end-level bosses. The most innovative part of this game comes after a level when you get to purchase new weapons - instead of simply buying upgrades, you can customize your ship by placing your new weapons anywhere on it.

		<desc>Similar to Speedball 2, Brutal Football is an ultra-violent sports game. Matches last 7 minutes, and the aim is to get the ball into the goal, kept by a net-minder. The oval ball can be thrown or kicked, this resulting in frequent up-and-under type kicks.
Violence is the pivotal element of gameplay: rather than rare occurrency, punching, stomping, use of weapons, and even decapitations are what the game action is rife with, and key to victory. Bonus and non-bonus items appear on the pitch, such as bombs to throw at opponents, rabbits to speed up the current player, or tortoises which slow him down.
Teams are a total of eleven and consist of seven humans and aliens, some of whom have unique skills. There's a lot of blood and flailing limbs, giving things a gruesomely humorous edge. Victory is achieved not only by scoring more goals than the opponent team but also decapitating all the players of it but one. The player is offered choice among a single match, knockout cup, and leagues to advance trough (for a total of four of them).</desc>

		<desc>The war of 1999 left the country of Kookistan in shambles. Naturally, a dictator named General Akhboob took control of the beleagured nation and began creating an army of radioactive mutants. With a virtually impenetrable stronghold, a bunch of hostages, and a legion of mutants under his command, the evil despot will stop at nothing but world domination. Only two men have the courage and idealistic naivete to take on Akhboob and his forces: Captain Carnage and Major Mayhem, also known as the Doomsday Squad.

As Captain Carnage or Major Mayhem, it is up to you or you and a friend (in simultaneous action) to rescue the hostages while shooting hundreds of mutants bent on your destruction. As you walk and run forward, backward, left, right, and diagonally through 20 battlezones of nonstop action, you'll always have your machine gun by your side. Additional weapons which you can find along the way include grenade launchers, rocket launchers, plasma machine guns, flame throwers, spray-fire rifles, defensive blades, and an assortment of bombs.

		<desc>James Pond, also known as James Pond: Underwater Agent, is a platform video game that was developed by British video game developers Vectordean Ltd and Millennium Interactive, and published by Millennium Interactive and Electronic Arts for numerous home computers and consoles in 1990. The character was popular and even featured in some comic books of the time, and the game was successful enough to spawn two sequels and one spin-off game.

A nefarious supervillain named "Doctor Maybe" (a pun on the name of Dr Julius No, the villain in Dr. No) has overtaken the ruthless megacorporation Acme Oil Co, and is not only filling the oceans with radiation and toxic waste but even threatening all the world from his underwater lair. The protagonist of the story and player character of the game is an intelligent, mutated anthropomorphic mudskipper who is given the name "James Pond" (after the legendary spy James Bond) and hired by the British Secret Service to protect the seas and take out the bad guys in underwater areas. He is also suave enough to seduce numerous attractive mermaids, some of whom act as double agents as is common with James Bond's love interests. The game spoofs James Bond movies with levels mimicking their titles, with level names like "License to Bubble" (after Licence to Kill), "A View to a Spill" (after A View to a Kill), "Leak and Let Die" (after Live and Let Die) and "From Three Mile Island with Love" (after From Russia with Love).</desc>

		<desc>Another World, also known as Out of This World in North America and Outer World (ã¢ã¦ã¿ã¼ã¯ã¼ã«ã AutÄ WÄrudo?) in Japan, is a 1991 cinematic platformer action-adventure game designed by Ãric Chahi for Delphine Software. The game tells a story of Lester, a young scientist who, as a result of an experiment gone wrong, finds himself in a dangerous alien world where he is forced to fight for his survival.

Originally developed for the Amiga and Atari ST and later released for the Apple IIGS and DOS platforms, the game was widely ported to other contemporary systems. Later efforts resulted in several game engine recreations for the game that permitted it to run on modern computers, consoles and mobile phones. In 2006, Chahi independently released a 15th Anniversary Edition for Windows which allowed the game to be played on modern computers with original or enhanced visuals; following up in 2011 for its 20th anniversary, ports of the game were prepared for iOS and Android based devices.

Another World was highly innovative in its use of cinematic effects in both real-time and cutscenes, which granted the game praise amongst critics and commercial success. It also influenced a number of other video games and designers.

Another World is a platform game, featuring a control scheme wherin the player uses either the keyboard, joystick or gamepad to make the protagonist run, jump, attack and perform other, situation specific actions such as rocking a cage back and forth. In the initial part of the game, Lester is unarmed, as he is able to kick at small creatures but is otherwise defenseless.

Later in the game, the player acquires a laser pistol from a fallen foe. The pistol has three capabilities: a standard fire mode, the ability to create force fields to block enemy fire, and a powerful charged shot that can break through force fields and some walls.[3] Eventually, Lester also gains a plasma ball that can be used like a grenade to defeat foes (not featured in the original Amiga release). Enemies also have the same capabilities, requiring the player to take advantage of the three gun modes and the environment to overcome them.

Lester and his alien ally cannot sustain any damage, and the game ends immediately if either of them is struck by a projectile or comes in contact with an animal or an environmental hazard.[4] However, the game uses numerous checkpoints enabling the player to keep restarting at the last point indefinitely. On the Amiga and older consoles without the ability to save a game, the player can write down an alphanumeric code for these checkpoints and re-enter it when restarting the game later. The game provides no clues as to what to do next, features no HUD (with an exception of oxygen bar during the swimming sequences) and no on-screen text, and the characters the player meets speak in unintelligible alien</desc>

However, a series of gruesome murders perpetrated by a sinister cult known as "The Kindred" shocks the city. Marie becomes a victim of their attack and falls into a coma. It becomes Sonny's very personal mission to track down the attackers and make them pay for their crimes.

The Kindred is the third installment of the Police Quest series, its events taking place after those described in The Vengeance. The game brings back some of the elements of the first game, such as a modified version of driving sequences and police procedures unrelated to the main plot the protagonist must go through. Computer work is particularly emphasized, requiring the player to perform tasks such as using facial composite software or figuring out murder patterns by studying a map. Like other Sierra adventures of the time, the game uses an icon-based interface for interaction with the environment.</desc>

		<desc>The mighty wizard Anthrax, in an attempt to usurp authority over the kingdom, has summoned a horrifying Demon. The Demon makes good on his chartered task by summoning a horde of monsters to lay waste to the kingdom at large. Fortuitously, a random stranger is strolling nearby the kingdom and realizes that only he can beat back the foul creatures.

After some encouragement from the king, the adventurer begins the game on horseback, jumping over obstacles, beating flying creatures, and collecting potions on the ground. Afterward, the hero must proceed on foot through side-scrolling platforming levels, destroying creatures with his blade as well as collecting potions and additional weapons he will find on his deadly quest.</desc>

		<desc>Six film reels have been stolen from your film studios by a rival company. In this platform game, your mission is to rescue from within the sets and backstage rooms they have been hidden in. Backstage sections are entered through doors, and weapons can often be collected in these.

The sets are themed around six different genres of film, and the backdrops, weapons and enemies fit these sections. There is a slapstick comedy played out in black and white (complete with greyscale background) a cartoon  with lots of Road Runnering and goofy facial expressions, a Wild West romp, Sci-Fi complete with aliens, and so on. After each platform level you will have to pass through a film scene - piloting a runaway mine-cart, navigating a scrolling shoot 'em up level, or similar.

		<name>Vroom</name>
		<desc>Vroom is a Formula 1 car racing game that can be played either in arcade or simulation mode. The main options screen allows you to select manual or automatic transmission, number of laps, and training, single race, or full season. The multiplayer option allows two players to race against each other on separate computers.

Each track, with different layouts and background graphics, includes many tight curves, steep grades and inclines, as well as tunnels and a pit stop.

The player-controlled car has working side-view mirrors, which allow you to view the actual action behind you, as well as a working speedometer and gear display.

The game features a colorful mix of 3D and 2D graphics, realistic sound effects, and blazing fast, smooth animations.

The result is a platform game across differently-themed levels, which are finished by either climbing to the top of the level or killing a boss. Bonus games and secret rooms have been included, and progression sometimes requires solving positional puzzles.

Alfred cannot fly, but he can use ramps to jump up and hit enemies with his bionic beak - this kills them, but any other contact will hurt Alfred. Watch out for spiked snails though. Other enemies include whales armed with guns, and stray bombs.</desc>

		<name>RoboCop 2</name>
		<desc>The Amiga version of RoboCop 2 is very similar to other versions of the game released by Ocean Software: it combines platform levels with a puzzle mode and a first-person shooting gallery. While the puzzle and shooting modes are very similar to those on the Atari ST, the main platform sections feature completely different level designs and separate gameplay mechanics.

All three of the platform stages present RoboCop with a set goal: destroying the Nuke drug lab, apprehending the criminal Cain and finally destroying Cain in his "RoboCop 2" form. On the way to the goals, RoboCop must defeat swarms of henchmen who attack him with guns, mortars and bazookas, and in the last level, various robotic enemies like flying drones and ED-209s. He can shoot back with a standard gun as well as pick up weapon power-ups in the form of cola cans: three-way shot, scatter shot and rapid fire, each with limited but ample ammunition. Other cans enhance the time limit of the level, replenish life energy or provide a temporary shield. Not every power-up should be picked up, however: some have negative effects like reducing the time limit or reversing the controls.</desc>

		<desc>Odyssey is a platformer with puzzle-solving elements. There are seven big, multi-directional scrolling levels which need to be conquered by finding all hidden crystals. The first three are available right from the start and the others gradually open up as a more crystals are found. A lot of time is spent with jumping over gaps and fighting the uncle's soldier with the sword, but there are many puzzles to solve. Much consists of the standard "finding an object and bringing it to the right spot", but the big catch is that the hero can transform into animals, e.g. a lion or a bird. Each animal has their own set of abilities which are needed to solve the obstacles the game throws at the player.</desc>

		<desc>In the Premier Manager series you lead a team from the Conference, the fifth division of English football, into the Premier League and onto European glory. Sign the right players and sell the bad ones to improve your squad. As in previous games in the series, the telephone puts you in touch with your staff, such as coaches to improve your players' skills and a scout to find new players. Stadium improvements (room for more supporters, undersoil heating, a better supporters' club) and sponsorship (assigning a brand to each piece of the stands around and above the pitch) are largely unchanged from PM2.

New to this version is the Assistant Manager - if you can sign a quality one, he can do jobs such as training for you. Tactical depth is increased in PM3 - each player can be assigned a position on the pitch depending on which sector the ball is in, in a manner similar to Sensible World of Soccer. Match coverage is fuller than in earlier versions, with an isometrically-viewed pitch displaying each touch in detail, helping you work our why your team lost 5-0, and how to stop it happening again.

		<desc>If you've ever suffered through an ant infestation problem or been besieged by the little critters on a family picnic, then SimAnt will probably strike a nerve.

SimAnt at heart is a simple game and doesn't have all the glittery action of adventure and action games but it is, after all, a simulation. What it does have is a great deal of integrity, intrigue and interaction and provides literally hours of immersive game play. The interface, as in most Maxis games, is intuitive and very easy to use. Graphics are what you might expect from an ant simulation, fairly simple in appearance but detailed enough to allow meaningful text, charts and graphs to enhance control. Sound effects are very well done and, in fact, can be toggled off if you don't like the sounds of ant carnage before breakfast.

SimAnt has an amazing amount of strategy involved in managing the survival skills. With a great interface and easy game control system, it's a breeze to play. Various modes offer depth of game play. Replay value depends on how much effort you want to put into managing a virtual ant colony.</desc>

		<desc>SimCity sets you as the mayor of a new municipality, with the responsibility of building and maintaining a place where citizens can move to and work and be happy. The first task is to place essentials such as housing, transport links, schools, factories and shops. There are 50 types of these, allowing for homes of all standards and different types of businesses. Make sure to consider which sites are effective for which tasks. Some power sources pollute, others don't but are more expensive. Taxes must be raised to ensure an income, and then portions allocated to public services such as policing and roads. Earthquakes, floods and fires are all emergency situations that must be dealt to contain any damage.

Successful mayoring will cause the small village to grow into a town, then a city and finally a metropolis. As the city's size grows so do it's needs. Commercial buildings may suddenly find that they need an airport to expand trade, or housing may find itself changing rapidly as vast amounts of people come and leave.

The game also includes 8 pre-defined time-limited scenarios, with specific challenges and targets. The environment varies in each game (especially if you have the Terrain Editor add on), and this should affect your choices.

		<desc>Defender of the Crown puts you in the role of one of four Saxon knights in medieval England, in a time where the land is in turmoil as the King is dead and his crown was stolen. The Saxons and the Normans blame each other and fight for control of England.

After a short introduction by Robin of Locksley himself, you start the game with a single castle and 10 soldiers at your command. From there, you have to build your army, take control of additional territories and fight the three Norman lords - and sometimes your Saxon friends as well.

The game has several different styles: You may either engage in a jousting contest where you have to knock your opponent off his horse using a lance, you can go raid a castle for loot or you can attack another territory/castle.

The game was originally created on the Amiga platform in 1986 by Cinemaware with wonderful graphics by James D. Sachs and great music by Jim Cuomo, then ported to the PC whilst keeping its original appeal and quality.

His surviving son Saul takes it upon himself to avenge his family. Using his father's research, he turns into a man-wolf and sets out to find CHIMERA's base and defeat their leader Karl Draxx.

As Saul, it is your job to traverse five different areas on your way to Draxx. When Saul collects enough power-ups, he turns into his wolf form and gains a special psychic shot attack, which can be improved by collecting futher power-ups. However, if Saul loses health, he turns back into his human form and only has his fists to fight the numerous enemies.

Paladin is an overhead turn-based strategy game played on various tiles. Players take a phase followed by enemies taking a phase. All actions, including movement will use up some of a character's MP (Movement Points). Possible actions include movement, opening doors, picking up items, using items, casting spells or attacking friends and foes on adjacent squares. Each quest is loaded up individually, though some quests may contain multiple maps. The paladin is the only character who can be transfered to any map and the only character to gain experience and new abilities.

The game features a level editor for creation of one's own quests, the game itself comes with 10 quests. New Paladins are also built from this editor. One paladin ("Brandon") comes ready-made with the game.

		<desc>The first game in Gremlin's series of football management games. You start off managing a team in the Conference (the fifth tier of English football) and aim to progress up the leagues, either by improving your existing team or earning jobs at better clubs elsewhere.

The features at your disposal include selecting training regimes, planning tactics for each match based on your opposition's strengths and weaknesses, scouting for new players including youth prospects, and arranging sponsorship and stadium improvements (so as to attract more fans).

The transfer system is a crucial part of the game, as you aim to sign players (who are broadly rated in each of the main skill areas) up against other teams who want them, and sell off players you don't need. You have an overdraft available, but make sure not to exceed it.

The game supports up to 4 players, whose matches all take place at the same time. You can make tactical changes and substitutions mid-match.

Players control a squad of Space Marines in an maze allowing 90 degree turns which they may view through multiple first person cameras or using an overhead map. Their mission: to wipe out the Genestealers, a vicious alien race inhabiting the derelict ships.

The 5-man squad (sometimes accompanied by another), encased in Terminator armors and armed with long range and melee weapons, can be given tactical orders (executed simultaneously) via map - with an option to temporarily freeze time (to give player more room for thinking).

The game features 51 missions, including tutorial and original Deathwing campaign. The CD-ROM re-release adds extra 9 missions and more digitized speech (in slightly better quality).</desc>

Now you have returned as a ghost, with psychic powers in place of your physical ones. Starting out at your own funeral, you must follow conversations to find clues. One early task is to find items which boost your physical abilities. You have help from other deceased beings, starting with pub owner Joe Danby.

Scapeghost was Level 9's final adventure game, and it is in the same format as the existing ones, which makes for a text parser with additional graphics. Puzzles require instructions to be given to other characters. The game is split into 3 days, each of which can be played independently of each other - November Graveyard, Haunted House and Poltergeist.

		<name>Shuttle : The Space Flight Simulator</name>
		<desc>Shuttle is a 1992 space flight simulator game developed by Vektor Grafix and published by Virgin Games. It has been praised as a reasonably accurate simulation game of piloting the NASA Space Shuttle. The software is noted for simulations of the space shuttle in many situations in a 3D environment, from leaving the Vehicle Assembly Building to returning to Earth at the Shuttle Landing Facility and displayed almost every switch, knob and display of the real shuttle control panels while simulating most of their respective functions. That said, only a subset of the controls actually worked and a number simply made the shuttle explode; however, it's quite likely that many of the same controls (e.g. separating the Solid Rocket Boosters while they were still burning during the launch) would make a real shuttle explode, as well. The operation of the General Purpose Computers (GPC) required the input of the according program commands for the current flight situation, albeit in a simplified fashion. Shuttle for the PC was released on two 360k floppy disks, however it could be copied to a single 1.44MB floppy and installed or run from there. Gameplay consisted of flying through simulations of a number of different space shuttle missions, starting with the Approach and Landing Tests where the original space shuttle, Enterprise, was flown from the back of a modified Boeing 747 to a gliding landing at Edwards Air Force Base, through to launching the Hubble Space Telescope, building a space station, using the Manned Maneuvering Unit to capture satellites for repairs, and launching 'secret' military satellites. The level of detail went so far, that the External Tank (ET) painted in white color was only displayed in the earliest available scenarios while the later one displayed the brown it wore later on. As the missions themselves were fairly complex, the game would optionally provide a high level of hand-holding. Instructions were passed to the player on a 'teleprinter', and when those instructions required the player to use the shuttle controls, the appropriate switch or knob would be indicated by a flashing box. As such, the normally massive amount of material the player would be required to read through in order to know how to accurately and safely pilot a shuttle were condensed into something the average player could understand, another point of praise for the game by its users. The camera zooms in on the Space Shuttle launch stack (MS-DOS) To further ease gameplay, the game supported multiple different camera views, more than the standard control panel and external view found in most simulators of the time, the player could also look out of any of the cockpit windows, including back into the payload bay when retrieving or releasing satellites, and some of the CCTV cameras on the Remote Manipulator System. In addition, for those who wanted to know a little more about the shuttle but did not wish to read NASA technical details, the developers also provided an in-game primer giving a few pages of information and some diagrams on each of the major Space Shuttle systems. Finally, the publishers supplied a thick game manual and a large poster showing the control panels. Given the scope and complexity of the game it shouldn't be surprising that it was released with a few bugs. In particular the autopilot could get confused and fly some very unusual re-entry trajectories. In early releases, it was impossible to fly the last mission. Fortunately there was an easy workaround for the latter bug, as putting /ALL on the DOS command line when starting up the game gave one access to every available mission.</desc>

		<desc>World War II is raging. The US has suffered an attack at Pearl Harbor, and most of its battleships are lost. The few remaining US carriers are fighting a desperate war against the Japanese surface fleets. But the US has a secret weapon: sleek, silent, deadly... you are a Submarine Commander!

The action is viewed from within the submarine. Watch out for your speed, direction and depth. This game features 9 types of submarines to choose from, 10 types of torpedoes to fire, 14 Japanese surface ships (9 warships, 5 transport), and the entire Pacific Ocean as your battleground. The seven missions all recreate real US navy engagements. Can you sink the Yamato???

		<name>Space Crusade</name>
		<desc>Space Crusade is a science fiction strategy game converted from the Games Workshop/Milton Bradley boardgame, in which you control a commander and four marines who are sent on different missions aboard hostile alien starships. Your commander starts off as a sergeant, but he can work his way through the ranks. The game allows three players, each commanding one marine chapter each. The alien team is `played` by the computer. 

The game is a literal conversion of the board game in the same vein as Gremlin's earlier Hero Quest. It can be best described as a turn-based board game in which the player must fulfill the primary and secondary objectives to complete the mission, which usually involves elimination of entire alien force on board or destruction of mothership etc. This game features unique 3D close-ups during the battle scenes, a feature which was later adopted by games like the X-Com series.

Space flight takes place in two different modes: Cruise Flight, which is ideal for travelling quickly, and Newtonian Flight, which works best for combat and precision flying. There are also three different camera views for the 3D exploration and combat. Each planetary system has a variety of destinations and obstacles to travel through via a top-down navigational map. Traveling to an outpost, a space station, or any other location with the star system can be done simply by selecting it and charting a course, or in real-time 3D flight mode.</desc>

		<desc>Starlord is a game of exploration and conquest from Mike Singleton, the author of the similarly-focused Midwinter and The Lords of Midnight. As the title implies, Starlord is set in a science-fiction world, as opposed to the fantasy universes of those previous games.

Your family are Starlords of a single planet, but seek dominance of a vast space consisting of 1000 individually-ruled planets. If you are to come out on top you will have to manage resources across each of your starbases, using revenue to ensure enough fuel, food and minerals are available. Trade with other leaders and form tactical agreements.

To actually take over planets, you will have to lead your ships into space combat, which is played out in multiple-view 3D.

		<name>Subbuteo : The Computer Game</name>
		<desc>Subbuteo recreates the famous table football game, which makes for something very different from Sensible/Kick Off/FIFA style games. It's effectively a turn-based strategy game of sorts, as each player has 30 seconds to make their move (within a 30 minute match length), which involves first selecting a player, then aiming the direction in which he will be flicked, then the power and swerve of the flick are determined by the length of time the button is held down for. 

With any luck, your player will hit the ball, and hit it such that it doesn't leave the playing area, and doesn't hit an opponent. If any of those rules are violated, possession passes to the opposition. Before each flick, the team not in possession can make a 'defensive flick' involving moving one of their players into a potential blocking position (without hitting the ball or an opponent, as this is a foul).

One of those creatures, named Franklin Snarl, traveled through the device to our reality and kidnapped Gramps, teleporting him into the crazy world of Tonetown. He hopes that Gramps will always remain asleep, which assures Snarl's own existence!

Now it's up to you, the hero of the game to travel to the alternate dimension of Tonetown and to rescue your grandfather. You interact with the environment by either typing in commands, or choosing one of the action icons available as interface. The game, therefore, combines text-based interaction with the more modern "point and click" approach.

		<desc>The basic Tetris gameplay, involving arranging each shape as you are given them to create complete lines, and then adjust to the remaining fragments falling down a line and perhaps blocking off lower lines, was reinvented in this title. The game is split into levels, and each one requires a set number of lines to be completed. As you do so, you gradually reveal a cartoony picture, varying from semi-naked girls to candles.

The levels usually have some amount of blocks already in place, which must be worked around, and often specify that picture lines are only awarded when you score 2 or more lines at a time. There are also power-ups, which come in some of the square blocks and are activated if you use them to complete a line. They include points bonuses, bombs to remove some of the existing tiles, and some Ã¢â¬Ëpower-downsÃ¢â¬â¢, such as one which turns the screen upside down, and one that removes the preview of the piece.</desc>

Skara Brae is in ruins. Someone - or some thing - has sealed the city's fate with an evil so vast, so unspeakable, that a host of Paladins and an army of Archmages are outmatched. Hard times call for subtlety. Smaller is better. Sneakier is better. What the world needs now is a thief. The Thief of Fate.</desc>

The plot centers around a "Sea Child" who was stolen, and Typhoon Thompson is sent in to rescue it, with the guidance of a few strange, cowled ghost-types (who would occasionally be nasty to poor old TT).</desc>

		<name>Ultima III : Exodus</name>
		<desc>After the defeat of the evil wizard Mondain and his mistress Minax in the previous two Ultimas, peace has returned to the land of Sorsaria. Times passes and eventually geological disruptions and a resurgence of the monster populace occur, and it is soon learned that Mondain and Minax had conceived a child named Exodus before their death. Now that child has become an adult with the power to avenge the death of his parents. Obviously, it falls upon the hero from Earth to find and stop him. The third title in the Ultima series was the first to feature a party of adventurers instead of a single player character. The party is created at the beginning of the game by assigning various class combinations and determining the characters' attributes. The game has larger and more detailed towns, populated by NPCs the protagonist can converse with to obtain clues. Like in earlier Ultima games, exploration is divided between top-down overworld locations and first-person 3D dungeons. This installment introduces separate combat screens where player-controlled party fights multiple monsters in a turn-based tile-based system.</desc>

		<name>Ultima IV : Quest of the Avatar</name>
		<desc>The fourth game in the Ultima series features an improved game engine, with color graphics and enhanced character interaction: the player can have conversations with non-playable characters by typing names of various topics. However, the main difference between Ultima IV and its predecessors in the series (as well as other role-playing games) lies in the game's objectives and the ways to fulfill them. Instead of building up a character by any means possible in order to face a villain in the end of the game, in Ultima IV the player is trying to become the Avatar, a role model for people. This means upholding the Eight Virtues, basically trying to become a better person. Making morally conscious decisions and helping other people is not done expecting a material reward, but because it is the actual goal of the game and the main focus of its gameplay. The game frowns on behavior typical of most other RPGs, such as backstabbing fleeing enemies or picking up everything that isn't nailed down even if it does not belong to the protagonist. This different approach established the game's reputation as the first "true" Ultima, influencing the design philosophy of later installments and the overall spirit of the series.</desc>

		<desc>The Avatar, the embodiment of the Eight Virtues and the hero of Britannia, is called back to deal with a grave threat. Lord British, the country's benevolent monarch, has disappeared, and a man named Blackthorn has usurped his throne. The tyrant rules the land by enforcing the virtues upon the will of the people, corrupting their meaning in the process. His fundamentalist visions led him to create a police state, where failure to adhere to the virtues is punishable by death. Behind Blackthorn are the three Shadowlords, anti-thesis to the three principles of Truth, Love, and Courage. The Avatar must understand their meaning and origins, find a way to defeat them, rescue Lord British, and restore the former ethical principles of Britannia.</desc>

		<name>Ultimate! Golf</name>
		<desc>The Great White Shark (Normans obligatory silly golfing nickname) has only recently been knocked off his number one spot by Nick Faldo Ã¢â¬â maybe he should practise a bit more on his own golfing sim!

Up to four human or computer players can participate, in Strokepay or Matchplay, with the option of playing Singles, Fourball, Foursome, or Greensome. The skill level of each computer player is determined by setting five factors: Experience, Stance, Grip, Swing, and Fitness. Up to fifty created players can be stored in a database.

After leaving three of your 17 clubs behind (you are only allowed 14), it is out onto either of two in-built courses (or others from planned course disks). From the first tee you are greeted by a 3-D view, a grid of squares raised and sunk at different angles to form hills and bunkers. Additional hazards are posed by trees and water pools. As the flag is often hidden, a map allows you to view the whole hole Ã¢â¬â you can even walk to any spot and get a 3-D view from that position.

When you are ready to play the shot, a power meter appears. A power bar rises, stopped by pressing fire. Then, before another falling bar reaches the bottom, you must press fire to stop a swaying direction needle in the middle for a straight shot, or on the marker indicating the amount of sidespin selected on the swing screen. Putting is achieved by aiming an on-screen cursor and selecting power.

Despite the number of options available this is not an excessively fancy game. It is accurate, intelligent and challenging and will prove to be one of the most popular sports sims of the year.</desc>

While driving on a lonely road at night, a strange figure blocks your vision causing you to swerve and crash your car. When you regain consciousness, you find that your brother is missing (in the NES-Version it's your sister who is missing). The only place he could have gone is a creepy old mansion which looms in front of you. With nowhere else to go, you enter the mansion in search of your brother. It turns out the mansion once belonged to an old wizard and his apprentice, and somehow it has become infested with the Undead.

The game is set in the distant future, where your job is nothing less than Colony Administrator for a new settlement on some far-flung planet. Your aim is to provide the highest Quality of Life rating for the colonists. 

You do so by ensuring that there is enough life support, power, housing, employment, police and entertainment to keep the citizens of your colony happy. Hindering your goal are random events such as solar eclipses (which can render your solar panels inactive) and also a different, hostile alien race that inhabits the planets in the many scenarios at offer. 

Not only do you have to be a good mayor but you also have to be a good general. Resources must not only be attributed to civilian research but into weapons research, intelligence and the building of tanks and spaceships, if you wish to survive long enough to see your colony flourish into a metropolis. As a rule, you will have built a strong colony before the aliens come, but the final push towards a QOL of 80% or higher can only be achieved once there is no outside threat.</desc>

Infinity has been jealous of his brother, the Good King Garamond, for as long as he can remember, and all for a twist of fate. Infinity had been born too late to be king.

Set in the mystical castle of Valhalla, you encounter a horde of brain melting puzzles through four vast levels of dazzling graphics and exceptional gameplay in which the art of communication is the name of the game. 

Use the joystick button to bring up a series of icon that let you access a map of the level, or to look at, pick up, operate, or move objects. The disk icon that is among them allows you to save, load, or restart a game. Some of these icons are available when you choose to use an inventory object on something on the screen. 

There are two bars on either side of the screen. One bar is your stamina. Whenever you stand on a hazard, your stamina decreases. When you have no stamina left, you die and are forced to restart the level. The other bar indicates, if you have picked up a flask, how much time that you have left before it is empty.</desc>

		<desc>Waterloo, arguably the most famous battle in history, was fought on June 18, 1815 between the French Forces of the Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte and the English and combined Allied forces under the Duke of Wellington and Prussian forces under Field Marshall Blucher.

Waterloo the game was a revolutionary new concept in wargaming when it was published in 1989. Waterloo dispensed with the normal overview given to wargame commanders and instead gave a player the same point of view as real commanders on the field of battle.

Your orders in an age of pre-radio communication must pass through an elaborate chain of command with varying levels of success in the execution of those orders. Your orders may even be ignored if there is better local intelligence or your officers lack the skill or courage to perform them. You as the commander (Napoleon or Wellington) must even deal with a time delay in the occurrence in events and the time it takes for those events to be relayed back to HQ and the time it takes to issue orders and see those orders carried out. A text parser is used to issue orders during the game. The battle ends at 9:30 pm at which time full battle reports will become available and the results assessed. You are also given the option to review the battlefield.The game is solitaire only and the playing time is 10-20 hours.

Wonderland is based on Lewis Carroll's classic children's book Alice in Wonderland, with the player taking on the role of Alice. It does not involve anything from that book's sequel, Through the Looking-Glass.

With this game, Magnetic Scrolls introduced a bespoke windowing system dubbed "Magnetic Windows". The player's inventory, the location's graphic, the map and so on are all in separate windows that can be moved and resized independently.[2] (A similar system is used in unrelated adventure games like Deja Vu.) The developers stated they believed it would make the game more accessible, giving it a much wider appeal.</desc>

Crash the plane though and it takes two days of your valuable time limit for Gyro Gearloose to fix it.nnnnUsing Huey, Dewey and Louie, each being one of your three lives in the mountain climbing level, you must get from the base of the mountain to the top to get your treasure. Using the boys, you can hop from ledge to ledge, or when the going gets tough, use your grappling hook! This is a lot of fun and requires precision. There are also caves in the side of the mountain, which can transport you up or down the mountain. But watch out for bears in the caves. Other obstacles include falling rocks, the Beagle Boys dropping objects from above, mountain goats, Magica de Spell and more.nnnnThe jungle features Scrooges' nephews again. Here you must use swinging vines, branches and even hippopotamus' backs to get to the treasure. Sleeping pumas, snakes, macaws and monkeys hamper you progress.nnnnSearching a cavern involves Scrooge, his nephews and niece, navigating a maze using the map at the bottom of the screen to get to the treasure whilst avoiding the yeti tracking them down.nnnnPhotography, with Webbigail, Scrooge's niece, involves her taking snaps of rare animals in a forest. Some animals get you more money for your snaps than others.nnnnOnce the thirty day marker is reached, whoever has the most gold between Scrooge and Glomgold is the winner.</desc>

Private investigators can be hired to either prevent to prove these things.    Although primarily a strategy game, a few short action sequences are also included. These come into play when attempting to drill for oil (you can hire a specialist to do this instead, but the cost is prohibitive in the early stages), to build oil pipelines around those of your opponents, and to extinguish any fires opponents start on your rig.</desc>

		<desc>In this platform game featuring over 2500 screens, our hero is in search of hidden treasures across worlds such as caves and castles, and must collect it all to advance onto the next level. The twist, as you may guess from the title, is that his weapon is a hammer which can be used to burrow into the ground. The blocks quickly reappear though, which can be fatal if they trap him, but can also be used by the cunning player to trap an enemy.   Not all the platforms and transporters on the levels are visible, which guarantees an element of Rick Dangerous-style trial and error. You have six lives, which isn't much considering that failing to complete a level within the time limit costs a life, and contact with enemies is costly (you can't drill through them Worms-style) </desc>

You control a neanderthal who must march through hostile pre-historic environments seeking food and keeping himself safe. Some food can be found in caves, but it mainly exists in living animal forms.  These include fire-breathing Pyro-Tax dragons, the Turtosaurus, and the Bad Bat. Each of these must be clubbed to death, some taking up to 5 hits, and then walked over. Some other enemies are indestructible, with the monkeys who throw coconuts at you particularly fiendish.  You will have to complete the level within the time limit, and avoid contact with these foes. However, bombs and improved weapons can be collected, as can extra lives, time bonuses and an improved jump. </desc>

		<name>Top Gear 2</name>
		<desc>This third-person racing game resembles Gremlin's earlier Lotus series, in terms of its general look and feel, right down to the text font used in the game. Your task is to race through 16 countries, each of which features four races, with many real-world circuits recreated in incongruous locations (such as the Monza layout in Ayers Rock, and the old Hockenheim in Vancouver).   These four-race blocks each represent their own mini-championship, in which you race against 19 cars, needing to finish in the top 10 to continue, and with the top 6 scoring points 10-6-4-3-2-1, and the respective amount of money in thousands. This can be spent on various upgrades, ranging from engine to tires (wet and dry) and from shocks (front, side and rear) to gearboxes. The ideal approach is to buy the more expensive versions ASAP, as you get no saving when upgrading. If you win the four-race championship, you get the next password.   You get a set amount of nitro boost to use during each race, although bonus nitros, money and instant speed-up token appear on many tracks. Hazards such as puddles, barriers and ramps are also frequent. </desc>

		<name>The Legend of Robin Hood : Conquests of the Longbo</name>
		<desc>The year is 1193, and the Third Crusade has just ended. Richard the Lionheart, King of England, returns to Europe from the Holy Land. On the way, he is ambushed and abducted by the soldiers of the Austrian duke Leopold. The duke demands a large ransom to be paid in exchange for the king's freedom. However, the king's brother, Prince John, is content with the situation and plotting to take the throne for himself. That is when the legendary Robin Hood, one who robs from the rich and gives to the poor, decides to raise the money needed to liberate the king, with the help of his fellow outlaws of Sherwood Forest.

Conquests of the Longbow is an adventure game and a follow-up to Conquests of Camelot. It uses an icon-based interface common to most contemporary Sierra adventures. Like its spiritual predecessor, it differs from most other games in the genre by reducing traditional inventory-based puzzles in favor of exploration and varied tasks dictated by the situation at hand. These include talking to characters, gathering information, making decisions, solving riddles, or participating in mini-games such as combat, archery contest, and Nine Men's Morris (with adjustable difficulty).

The game is divided into days; each day is completed when certain tasks have been fulfilled. It is, however, possible to fail some of those tasks and still advance the plot. Several situations can be handled in different ways. The player's decisions affect Robin Hood's ranking towards the end of the game. Number of points scored, the amount of money collected for the ransom, and the fate of Robin's fellow outlaws are considered when awarding the rank. Depending on these factors the player reaches one of the four possible endings, ranging from Robin getting hanged to a happy conclusion of his love life.</desc>

(Digital Armoured Virus Exterminator) and eliminate the enemies before it's too late. The levels are split into worlds with four levels each, and each world has its own theme. For example the first world is sport themed so you will drive over football fields, billiard tables and racing courses. 

The gameplay is the one of an isometric shooter, where you roll around the levels and shoot the enemies with one of several weapons. The weapons covers the whole range from fast but not so powerful weapons to more powerful (but slow) like mortars. The action can be enjoyed by one or two players both turn-by-turn or simultaneous where one player controls movement and the other the weapons.

		<name>No Second Prize</name>
		<desc>There is indeed no second prize in this race between 6 of the worlds toughest riders. First prize is the one remaining model of the greatest motorbike the world has ever seen, incidentally.

The graphics are polygon based, with lots of roadside detail, and leaning into corners to maximise turn-in leads to the graphics to tilt appropriately. The control is mouse-based, allowing for slight adjustments to be made and ensuring that the controls are realistic but not impossible. As well as your five rivals, there are lots of Sunday riders on the roads, distinguished by having brown bikes, so make sure to avoid these.

This was one of the first games to feature video-style replays, allowing you to find the exact moment you want to replay, from any part of the race, and view it at normal speed, double-speed, or freeze-frame. The camera angles on offer here include one that follows the bike, one that views the track from the side, and a TV-style chase view.

		<name>20000 Leagues under the Sea</name>
		<desc>The game is based on an 1870 novel by Jules Verne.

On July 5th, 1867 the government decided to launch the famous ship the "Abraham Lincoln", which will leave on the trail of a sea monster. The great French professor Mr. Arronax will also take part in the expedition. The weeks passed without any sign of the monster's presence in the area, when, one day, 300 miles from the shores of Queen Charlotte's Island... three members of the expedition set out on board the Nautilus, a submarine navigated by Captain Nemo. The player takes Anorax's role to find out more.

Most of the game is spent on the Nautilus, which consists of three rooms: the living room, the control room and the library. There the player can manipulate objects and talk to people to receive hints what to do next and the state of the Nautilus. With the map, he influences the route. Sometimes the player leaves the submarine to explore other locations, and respectively solves puzzles to receive more hints or to solve action sequences, e.g., fighting against a shark. 

The game is played in real-time, which means the key to success is being in the right location at the right time. This also results in various possibilities to render the game unwinnable, and causes waiting times. For the same reason, the player also needs to watch Nemo's mood. If he angers Nemo, e.g., by manipulating the ship instruments, he locks the player into his room and valuable time passes. The game is played completely in point &amp; click and has no function to save progress.</desc>

		<name>A.M.C. : Astro Marine Corps</name>
		<desc>AMC is a 2D game with horizontal scrolling in 2 phases (typical of Spanish games), in the same style as Gryzor. In the first phase, one plays a commando that is sent on the planet DENDAR to trap the ship of the Death Bringers, the bearers of death. There are 11 different enemies to meet you, and Krauer, the Death Bringers leader who protects the ship and is 4 meters tall.

The game starts with a single shot, then the weapon is expanded over the game, we pick up weapons more and more powerful. Note that the contents of the crates sent from the sky by the Astro Marine can be changed by the Death Bringers, so you can die suffocated by green carnivorous plants.

Phase 2 of the game takes you to the Death Bringers ship that drops you on their planet, and you have to exterminate them in a limited time, and contains 13 different enemies and the end boss, Great King Alien.</desc>

		<name>Alien Breed</name>
		<desc>Alien Breed is a top-down science fiction shooter somewhat inspired by the movie Alien in terms of plot and atmosphere. Gameplay, though, was obviously inspired by the Atari arcade classic Gauntlet. The game tells a typical sci-fi story of an alien invasion on the space station ISRC-4. Two space marines, Johnson and Stone, are the only human beings left to clear the base of aliens.

Moving around an alien-infested complex in a top-down view, you must at all times keep an eye not only on your energy level, but also be conservative with ammunition. Though you will find new ammo cartridges strewn around the levels, they are consumed quickly by respawning aliens that may come crawling out of the floors and walls when you least expect it. On the floors, you will also find keys for passing through locked doors. Keys must also be used with care, or you may find yourself locked out of a room containing the remaining keys that you will need in order to complete the level. Other doors are one-way, and will electrocute you if you try to pass it in the other direction.</desc>

		<name>Space Quest IV : Roger Wilco and the Time Rippers</name>
		<desc>When reading the documentation is more fun than playing the game, you know that you are on to a loser. Space Quest IV is a very dry, slow affair which seems to ignore all the encouraging advanced made in the adventure genre over the last couple of years.

The story concerns Roger being plucked from his own time and dumped back on his home planet Xenon far into the future. The place is looking a bit worse for wear and zombies wander the street. As it turns out this is the result of a super computer having gone mad after being infected by a virus caught from a pirate copy of Leisure Suit Larry (and if you think that is a hoot, then the humour is just about on your level Ã¢â¬â it never gets any better).

The old-fashioned 16-bit graphics are, to put it politely, hideous, and the animation, such as there is, makes Roobarb And Custard look like a Disney classic. The other big problem is with the gameplay itself Ã¢â¬â there is very little interaction with other characters. For the first quarter of the game, if you try to talk to anyone, you end up dead seconds later Ã¢â¬â hardly an incentive to continue.

It is hard to imagine even real adventure buffs enjoying this much. It is very old-fashioned and has an air of tiredness about it. Avoid.</desc>
