		<desc>The game starts in New York City, where President Ronnie has been kidnapped by the nefarious DragonNinja. The game's intro begins with the following introduction: "Rampant ninja related crimes these days... Whitehouse is not the exception...". As soon as that occurs, a Secret Service agent asks two street-smart brawlers, named Blade and Striker: "President Ronnie has been kidnapped by the ninjas. Are you a bad enough dude to rescue Ronnie?". 

After hearing that, the Bad Dudes pursue the DragonNinja through the city streets, highway, sewers, transport train, forest, cave and into the secret ninja base in order to save President Ronnie.</desc>

		<desc>You're the carpenter and your task is to complete the squares until you've filled the screen. Sound easy? Not when you hear what's trying to stop you. A gorilla, ghost, eraser and burst of fire all wander the paths. The eraser erases uncompleted squares and the gorilla would love to hammer you. But you're not defenceless. With three swift punches you can knock them out, except for the fire which can't be stopped. Each level introduces a larger area to fill so keep moving!</desc>

		<name>Trog</name>
		<desc>1 to 4 players take on the role of a cute dinosaur, selected from the four on offer: Rex (red), Bloop (blue), Spike (yellow) and Gwen (lavender). The game takes place in a prehistoric land called 'Og' and is made up of forty-nine different islands; the dinos must collect all of the dinosaur eggs that lay on the islands, while avoiding the unwanted attention of a tribe of one-eyed cavemen, called 'Trogs'. The dinos can punch the attacking Trogs; one punch will only stun a Trog but several punches will knock the enemy off the screen. There are 4 different Trogs who pursue the dinos:
Brown Trogs who use only their fists.
Red Trogs who use clubs and create fires or holes in the ground.
Blue Trogs who pop up out of the ground and roll stone wheels.
Green Trogs who bounce around trying to crush you with their springs.
On each island, after the dinos have gathered up all of their eggs, they must make their way to the base labeled 'Home'; from here they will move on to the next island.

Between each stage, there is an intermission where the players' Dinos will dance, with an on-screen caption proudly declaring 'Excellent!', 'Congratulations!', 'Nice Work!', 'Good Job!' or 'Dino-Mite!'. On occasion, an intermission screen appears that shows a Trog planning another attempt to eat a Dino.</desc>

		<desc>Track &amp; Field © 1983 Konami.

Track &amp; Field is an athletics-themed action game for up to four players, who compete against each other in six track and field-based disciplines. 

The game controls consist of two run buttons (one for each 'leg' of the athlete) and one 'Action' button. Players must hit the two run buttons alternately to build up speed and use action button to jump or throw.

In each event, there is a qualifying time or minimum score threshold that the player must achieve to advance to the next event. failing to qualify (in one heat for track events or in three attempts in the other events) will reduce the players' number of lives by one, the game is over once all lives are lost.

Track &amp; Field can accommodate up to four players, who compete in pairs in the running events and individually in the others. If there are fewer than four players, the remaining slots are played by the computer (or player "CPU"). In all multiplayer heats, however, the relative performance of the players has no effect on the game and advancing is based solely on reaching qualifying times and targets.

The six events are:

100M DASH - Run as fast as possible.
LONG JUMP - Run to the take-off board then choose angle of jump (42 is the optimum angle).
JAVELIN - Run to the line then choose angle of throw (43 is the optimum angle).
110M HURDLES - Run and time jumps over the hurdles.
HAMMER THROW - As the athlete spins faster and faster, time release of hammer and angle of throw (45 is the optimum angle).
HIGH JUMP - The athlete will run to the bar; just as he reaches it, use Action button to start the jump and hold down the action button to reduce the angle of climb, i.e. you start going straight up at 90 degrees if you tap the button just once. Use run buttons while in the air to gain extra height.</desc>

In this game, the player controls a fighter and has to shoot as many enemy fighters as possible while the stage is moving forward. There are many bonuses and new weapons available. The gameplay is reminiscent of several 1980s scrolling shooter arcade video games, and is therefore considered a retro game.</desc>

		<name>2020 Super Baseball</name>
		<desc>In the year 2020, baseball finally evolved. There is no longer conventional professional baseball in 2020. Baseball designed by the Super Baseball Association has been very popular and is the best sport.

However, the truth is that the association has used a colossal sum of money to promote Super Baseball as show business. They have manipulated each player's ability using the control computer to secretly decide victory or defeat in every game. The players who knew this removed the connecting parts of the computer to play their own game of baseball. Finally, a fair game is going to be played at Cyber Egg Stadium.

In 2020 Super Baseball is a fast-paced game with new rules, where you can select 1 of 12 individual men, women, or robot players. During play, you can make your team stronger with prizes earned from amazing catches.

		<name>Acrobat Mission</name>
		<desc>A great vertical scrolling shoot'em up game.

At the year 2100 A.D. Humans were exterminated by their own self-destructive nature leaving behind the consequences of environmental degradation on earth and were forced to escape to Mars leaving a bio-computer for environmental recuperation of earth to preparing the blue planet for future recolonization. But one day a half a century after humans arrived, mars was attacked by strange flying objects. To fight these enemies, the director general of the Defence Agency organized the task force army and started quickly the dogfight with invaders to neutralize the invasion. 

The operation was called 'Acrobat Mission' as it exceeded the technical limits of the pilots.

The players takes controls on one of two surviving fighters pilots, 'Jet' a male pilot and 'Nova' a female pilot and both flying the Icarus, a fast and powerful space-fighter, which comes equipped with a Standard laser. Two more weapons are available throughout the game - the wide shot (W) which spreads out in front of the ship and the Hurricane shot (H) which fires clusters of rotating balls of energy. Holding the fire button charges up a special attack and each weapon features a different energy blast and damage factor. The ships can also hold a maximum of two smart-bombs, one under each wing - although they can be activated by the players, they also do fall off easily and can be detonated by enemy shots. Interestingly, the Icarus can't collide with other ships or any part of the scenery - instead, it bounces off and only suffers damage from enemy shots. However, once the shield is depleted, the ship will fly out of control for a few seconds and grant the players a last chance to inflict damage to any remaining enemies before it explodes.</desc>

In subsequent levels a sportscar, a beach buggy, a boat, a chopper and even a Formula-1 racing car can all be driven. All of the vehicles are, of course, fully armed to deal with the many enemy vehicles and gun emplacements intent on stopping the player's progress. The helicopter levels play as a straightforward vertically-scrolling shoot'em up and bear more than a passing resemblance to Namco's "Xevious".</desc>

		<name>Aggressors of Dark Kombat</name>
		<desc>Aggressors of Dark Kombat is another one-on-one street fighting beat 'em up from the Neo-Geo's seemingly endless library of fighters.

It pits 8 fighters of different styles and strengths against each other in a tournament to see who's the toughest mofo on the streets of Tokyo. Your objective as usual is to deplete your opponent's health bar within the time limit by using your basic attacks and special moves (triggered by specific controller motions) while avoiding his moves and attacks.

Unique to Aggressors of Dark Kombat is the combination of traditional side-scrolling beat 'em up elements, meaning characters can freely move in an isometric space instead of being restricted to a single plane of movement. Weapons and throw-able items are usually thrown into the arena by the crowds and you can pick them up and wield them for added damage. Additionally, matches are 1-round only affairs, with an extended multi-layered health bar that allows for longer rounds than usual.</desc>

		<desc>The player has been issued an emergency order. He must save the earth from being conquered by enemy forces. He climbs into his helicopter and prepares for intense aerial combat. Shooting oncoming enemy aircrafts and bombing the enemies below, he tries to make his way through the different stages to reach the enemy base. When he finishes the first stage, he is transported to his next mission by ab aircraft carrier. He hops into his jet fighters, tanks, ships, helicopters, and aircraft carriers. The player must also be aware of unseen enemies and surprise attacks.

Different kinds of power ups can be obtained throughout the game. These include:
'3' 3-Way: Bullets fire forward, right, and left.
'L' Laser: Player can shoot double lasers.
'T' Triple: Missiles are fired that spread out three ways in front.
'V' Vulcan: Rapid bullets are fired in the directions controlled.
'B' Bomb: Air to ground missles which can be upgraded twice.
'O' Orbital: A small drone using the same weaponry as the helicopter which can be otained by clearing a special formation of little red fighters.

There is an additional super weapon that destroys all the enemies on the screen at once. However, use of this weapon is limited.

Ajax contains 2 different types of stages: 2-D and 3-D. In the 2-D stage, the player controls a helicopter. In the 3-D stage, the player commands a jet fighter.

Ajax features some impressive graphics filled with rotation and scaling effects (some may get a little dizzy, though!), a solid soundtrack and excellent game control. Highly recommended for any shoot'em up enthusiast!</desc>

The player must collect four power ups to upgrade their weapon. There are four weapon types: L, a laser weapon, S, a support drone, M, a tracing missile, and F, gatling Fire, a spread-out vulcan bullet shot.

Four levels of power-ups are available for each weapon, however each level requires four power up tokens be collected. There are also two special "bomb" weapons available for collection - green Energy Spark for a screen-covering swarm of lower-power bombs and blue Thunder Drive for a narrower and more focused attack. The Energy Spark clears all bullets from the screen, while the Thunder Drive only clears bullets that actually touch the blast. This blast starts momentarily atop the player, but quickly moves forward a short distance and stays stationary for a few seconds before dissipating.</desc>

		<desc>Ali Baba and 40 Thieves is an arcade game in which the player must utilize a four-way joystick to take control of the eponymous Ali Baba who must fend off and kill the forty thieves as they try to steal his money; at the start of the game, Ali Baba goes into the room at the top of the screen as that text "Open Sesame" appears above him, grabs the seven bags of money and takes them down to the room at the bottom of the screen. He will now have to hit each of the forty thieves as they enter the room - but if one of them should make it to the room at the bottom of the screen he will pick up one of the seven bags of money then try to take it back up to the room at the top of the screen. If the thieves take all seven of the money bags up to the top of the screen, it will cost Ali Baba a life; but, if he "hits" all forty thieves without this happening (except the large and invulnerable red one), he will proceed to the next level.</desc>

Ten years after its original arcade release, it was ported to the Sharp X68000, and it was also included in the fifth volume of the Namco Museum series on the Sony PlayStation. The game's primary protagonist, Toby "Kissy" Masuyo, predates by one year Samus Aran from Metroid as a human female playable character, although her face isn't revealed until she defeats the Octy King at the end.</desc>

		<path>./centiped.zip</path>
		<name>Centipede</name>
		<desc>Centipede is a vertically oriented single screen shoot-em-up in which the aim is to use the 'Bug Blaster' to shoot the centipedes that snake down towards the bottom of the screen to amass as high a score as possible. 

The play-field is littered with randomly placed mushrooms and the rapidly descending Centipede changes direction when it runs into a mushroom. When a segment of the Centipede is shot, the segment is destroyed and a mushroom appears in its place, the Centipede then breaks into two smaller centipedes, each with its own head, and continues its descent. 

Players can move the Bug Blaster vertically as well as horizontally, although only for the lower fifth of the play-field. Mushrooms can also be shot for points and to clear blocked areas. Once a Centipede reaches the bottom of the screen, it starts snaking back up, but remains within the lower section of the play-field near the player's Bug Blaster.

Additionally, any Centipede that reaches the very bottom of the screen without being shot releases its tail section which then becomes a new head. Other new heads also enter the screen from the bottom corners of the play-field as time progresses.

Randomly moving Spiders also appear in the first wave. Spiders can destroy any mushrooms they move over, eliminating many mushroom targets for a player. If the Bug Blaster and a Spider collide, both are destroyed. the Spider either moves at a 45-degree angle or vertically up and down, never simply left or right like the centipede does.

A bombardment of Fleas appears from the second wave onward. As a Flea descends, it leaves a trail of new mushrooms behind it. Fleas appear when a certain number of mushrooms remains at the bottom of the screen. This number increases as the game progresses, meaning Fleas appear more often later on in the game. The Bug Blaster must hit a Flea twice to destroy it; the first shot simply speeds up its descent.

When a Centipede with fewer than eleven segments appears, a Scorpion enters from either side, moving at a relatively slow speed. As the player earns more points, the Scorpion's speed increases. As the Scorpion travels across the screen, it 'poisons' the mushrooms that it moves over and changes their colours. These mushrooms cause any Centipedes that would collide with them to head straight towards the bottom of the screen, rather than continue snaking left and right. The Bug Blaster can stop a poisoned Centipede by shooting its head.

If a player earns at least 60,000 points, two things happen to increase the challenge: the Fleas descend at a faster speed and the Spiders restrict their movement to a smaller area at the bottom of the screen.</desc>

The game puts the player in the role of Mr. Chack'n, who must rescue all of the hearts that were stolen during a romantic interlude between him and Miss Chack'n. Chack is an interesting character with interesting abilities. He can toss two bombs, only one in each direction at a time.

The game consists of 16 sectors (rounds) of play. Sector 1 begins with Large Energy Rings floating randomly across the screen. The Spaceship must avoid colliding with the Rings, or it will explode into a starburst of brilliant colors. The Spaceship dodges the Energy Rings by moving right or left across the playfield, while bursting them with the Spaceship's 3-directional guns. Bursting the Large Rings (100 points) breaks them into Medium Rings. Bursting the Medium Rings (200 points) breaks them into Small Rings. Bursting the Small Rings (400 points) causes them to disintegrate.

As well as walking along the platforms and poles, the chameleon can use its tongue to pull itself up to higher platforms; and to escape from any nearby chickens. Each level also has a number of bombs placed at various points; the chameleon can hit these with its tongue to send them crashing towards nearby chickens. The player must keep an eye out for projectiles thrown by the chickens, such as flashing eggs.

If the nesting eggs are left for too long, they will hatch into a baby chick. The player can eat the chick for bonus points, but if the chick is left alone for too long, it will grow into an adult chicken and start attacking the player.

A level is over once all of the eggs have been collected and all of the chickens killed.</desc>

The caterpillar must eat all the strawberries and nuts on each level to become a butterfly. Eating a strawberry temporarily makes the caterpillar invincible allowing it to kill the deadly bugs and score 400 bonus points ber bug. If the caterpillar remains still for too long, an invincible owl (replaced by an invincible bat in later levels) will appear. If your catepillar moves, the owl or bat will disappear.  If your catepillar remains still, the invincible owl or bat will chase the caterpillar, albiet not very effrctively.  

When the caterpillar crosses over a pivot branch, all the branches will rotate at once, and any bugs that are on those branches will fall off and score 400, 800, 1600 and 3200 points, depending on the amount of bugs killed. Keep an eye out for the flowers that will appear below the house - they will reward you between 400 and 3200 points, depending on the level.</desc>

The game includes a Pit-stop facility, a feature that had appeared a year earlier in Taito's "Continental Circus". Should the player's car sustain too much damage, a pit-stop must be made to implement repairs. A 'damage meter' at the bottom of the screen shows the severity of the damage; highlighting what car components are in need of repair; Engine, Front Tires, Rear Tires and Brakes.</desc>

Gibson drives a powerful unmarked police car (resembling a Porsche 911) along with his partner, 'Raymond Broady' and must chase down and apprehend various criminals.

The player has between fifty-five and seventy seconds (depending on the game's 'Dip' settings) to catch up with the fleeing criminal, then the same time period again to repeatedly ram into the criminal's car until it is too damaged to drive. The criminal's car is constantly moving away, so if the player repeatedly crashes or drives too slowly, the criminal will escape and the game ends.</desc>

		<desc>A pseudo-sequel to Williams' superb 1990 shoot-em-up, "Smash TV", Total Carnage is set in a futuristic parody of the first Gulf War. General Ahkboob, himself an obvious parody of Sadam Hussein, has set his vast army of infantry, tanks and BioGenetic Mutants onto the world.

1 or 2 players must fight through the enemy-packed levels, rescuing reporters and civilians as they go. Total Carnage retains the dual-joystick control of its predecessor, but introduced new weapons, enemies and large, scrolling levels to the original game-play.

As with "Smash TV", Total Carnage features the infamous 'Pleasuredome'; accessible only if players manage to collect the 220 keys that are hidden throughout the game's levels. Total Carnage has a much higher difficulty level than that of "Smash TV".</desc>

The player flies a spaceship (specifically, a bioship) which has the standard forward guns to be found in all horizontal scrollers, but it also possesses a weapon that can be manually targeted with a crosshair, in the same manner as in the game "Missile Command". This allows the player to fire in any direction with pinpoint accuracy, and adds an extra level of strategy to the game. The player's bioship can also collect power-ups to grow bigger (becoming more powerful), and can acquire spherical pods which attach to the ship and increase its firepower.</desc>

		<desc>Strap on your vector spacesuit, and hop into your vector spaceship. It is a good old ship, and it has seen a lot of action. From navigating the asteroid belt and blasting aliens around the sun, to attacking evil space cannons, your little vector ship has done it all, and this time it has been upgraded with twin blasters. You see the ship in Cosmic Chasm seems to be the same spaceship that is in every vector game. You control it using rotation buttons and a thruster button, with a laser and a shield button thrown in for good measure, just like almost every other vector game around.    Now here is what you have to do. You guide your ship through a space fortress room by room. Each room contains a center section that slowly grows and will eventually trap you if you are not fast enough. You can shoot the center section to slow its growth. Each room also contains several exits. One of the exits will always spew forth a bunch of bad guys, shoot them, then exit to go to a different room. Between rooms you get to see an excellent tunnel animation. The idea is to make your way to the center of the fortress, blast the power core, and then leave. There is a map at the top of the screen to keep you from getting lost. This is a pretty decent game. It has a lot more to offer than the one screen of bad guys that most vector games have.</desc>

The player's character fights against his or her opponent in best two-out-of-three matches in a single player tournament mode with the computer or against another human player. The player has a character roster of nine fighters to choose from, and three bosses, each with their own unique fighting style and special techniques. The control layout is set to the six-button standard (a la most Capcom fighting games), but it can be switched to a five-button layout via dip settings. One unique feature is that Kaiser Knuckle was the first and only fighting game that has five strengths of basic attacks.  Another unique feature is that it introduced the power zones, which can be utilized via a successful hit of a special move when a player's "Crush Meter" is full. The power zones (either fire or electric) can affect the certain special move a character has. Backgrounds can be destructible when players get hit to charge up, and when those meters are full, the next special move that a player connects with his/her opponent will destroy the background's properties at will (other parts of stages, such as floors and walls are also destructible).</desc>

		<desc>Sky Soldiers is a vertical scrolling Shoot em' Up developed by Alpha Denshi and released to arcades in 1988 by Romstar in North America and SNK for the rest of the world. The game features a time travel theme as well as an organized weapon select screen at the beginning of each stage.    Players travel back in time starting in Great Britain 1945, Germany 1915, Japan 1945, Germany 1944, Vietnam 1974, France 1914, Russia 1974 and finally the space station in the present time, 2110. Each time stage has two levels, both ending in a boss battle save for the final stage, resulting in a total of 15 Areas.    The ship's weapon system is accessed in the beginning of each stage. The shipâ€™s main shot consists of a semi-automatic Wave Shot. The shipâ€™s bomb weapons include forward firing missiles, fireballs, homing missiles and the buster bomb. The ship can be equipped with only one bomb weapon from either category at a time. The ship can only be loaded with a certain number of Bomb weapons and they can only be resupplied at the end of the level. The only pick-up item in the game is a parachuting human pilot shot down from malfunctioning fighter planes/jets; collecting these pilots results in random bonus points.</desc>

		<name>The Empire Strikes Back</name>
		<desc>The third arcade outing based on the legendary trilogy of films; "Empire Strikes Back" eschews Jedi's Zaxxon-inspired gameplay and returns once more to the 3D vector graphics of the first game. Empire features four stages of play, with the first two putting the player in control "Luke Skywalker's" SnowSpeeder, and the second two in control of "Han Solo's" Millennium Falcon.    The first level, Probots, takes place on the ice planet of Hoth, with the player flying the Snowspeeder over the planet's surface to find and destroy the Empire's search droids that are sending signals to the Empire warning them of the rebels' presence.  The second Snowspeeder stage sees the player taking on the Empire's "AT-AT" Imperial walkers, as well as a number of smaller, bi-pedal "AT-ST" walkers. On this level, as well as the standard guns, the Snowspeeder is armed with a limited number of harpoons; these can be fired at the AT-AT's legs to send them crashing to the ground. AT-ATs can also be destroyed by shooting a small, highlighted area on the AT-ATs' head.  The third level has the player piloting the Millennium Falcon and is a repeat of the original game's in-space Tie Fighter battle.  For the fourth and final level the player must pilot the Millennium Falcon safely through a densely packed and fast-moving asteroid field.    Bonus points can be earned by destroying a certain number of targets. A JEDI letter will also be awarded in addition to the bonus points. Once all the letters that spell the word 'JEDI' have been awarded, players will have attained true JEDI FORCE, making them invincible to the Empire's forces for a limited amount of time.    In all levels of play, collisions with objects and enemy shots will cause damage to the player's deflector shields.</desc>

		<desc>After Burner is another Sega game rendered with their then-ubiquitous 3-D sprite-scaling technology; this time putting the player into the seat of a powerful F14 Tomcat jet fighter. 

Players must fight their way through 21 colourful, fast-moving stages, shooting down waves of enemy fighters while avoiding the enemy's incoming missiles. The F14 is equipped with a machine gun and a limited number of homing missiles. The gun has infinite ammunition and targeting is achieved by maneuvering the Tomcat so that the targeting cursor situated just in front of the jet is placed over an enemy fighter. 

After Burner's straightforward shoot-em-up gameplay is simple and repetitive, but the game's incredible visuals ensured its success.</desc>

		<name>Air Buster: Trouble Specialty Raid Unit</name>
		<desc>Air Buster is a horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up video game produced by Kaneko and co-distributed by Namco for the arcades in 1990. It was subsequently ported to the PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 (under the title Aero Blasters) and for the Mega Drive/Genesis in 1991. 
In Air Buster, the player controls a fighter jet also designed for space travel and shoots enemies, collects power-ups, and defeats bosses to advance levels. Players choose between one of the two Blaster fighters through scrolling six stages. The Blaster fighters can equip one of seven weapons. The weapons include the Striker weapon which adds additional firepower through vertically aligned Options, the Reverse shot which fires two diagonal shots from the rear of the ship, the Six Way Shot which fires semi-automatic shots in six directions and the Homing Shot which tracks enemies all around the screen. The other three weapons are Missile based which vary from Red straight-firing Rockets and Green Homing Missiles. There is also the Border item which surrounds the front of the ship, keeping it from crashing into foreground objects. The only other Items include Power-Ups which increase the ship's standard shot power and Bonus Points that appear in the sign of Dollar signs.</desc>

		<name>Air Duel</name>
		<desc>The player selects from a jet fighter or helicopter, shoot enemies in the air and ground, collect power-ups, and defeat bosses to advance levels.

The game differs from most others in the genre in that you can change the aircraft you use at the start of each level. The jet fighter always shoots straight forward; power-ups increase the width and strength of its shots. The helicopter fires thinner and weaker shots, but turns in the direction it moves (similar to the later Zero Gunner), giving it great range; powerups increase the strength of shots, as well as the number of bullets per shot (adding a small "spread" effect to the shot while moving around).
Both the fighter and the helicopter also start with three bombs which wipe out everything in their path, including enemy shots. These bombs are also unique compared to similar games, in that they produce a line of small horizontal blasts that can be "directed" at the line travels across the ground, by pressing left and right (similar to the helicopter's shots). Additional bombs can be picked up during the course of the game.

Losing a life resets your power and bomb count to the amount you start with. "Air Duel" is a challenging game, and later levels can become nearly unplayable if a single life is lost.</desc>

Fight your way through seven stages in this horizontal-scrolling game, and defeat a boss at the end of each one. You start the game with four main weapons, which you can switch from with the click of a button. Some of these weapons are more powerful than others. You can also fire off a charged shot if your main weapon level is two or greater, simply by holding down the fire button for about two seconds. Using charged shots can do more damage to an enemy ship. If you happen to die, you will lose one power level from all four weapons. If all your lives are lost and are forced to continue, you will start again with your main weapon on the second power level and all three sub-weapons on the first power level.</desc>

The object of the game is to eat all of the larvae - represented as round dots - before the timer runs out. Once all larvae have been eaten, play moves onto the next stage.

Players can only eat ants with the tip of the anteater's tongue, if an ant touches any other part of the tongue, the anteater is bitten and a player life is lost. As well as the ants, worms also roam the stages, worms will not harm the anteater upon contact with the extended tongue but if the head of the worm touches the tongue's tip, the player loses a life. Worms can be safely eaten from behind. 

Large queen ants are situated at the bottom of the nest and eating these will temporarily clear all insects from the screen.  

Anteater has a short day-night cycle represented by a moving Sun at the top of the screen. Once the sun has traveled across the screen and night falls, a spider will appear. The spider climbs down the anteater's tongue, taking a life if it reaches the tongue's tip. The spider can only be killed by eating a queen ant.</desc>

A long time ago, an evil wizard has taken over the peaceful kingdom of Shahariyard and used sorcery to transform its king into a Monkey. The player must defeat each of the game's seven Guardians to reclaim the 'Jewel of Seven Colours' and release the king from the evil hex. 

Each player can select from four distinctive characters: Prince Lassid, Princess Lisa, Sinbad or Afshael. Each character carries a primary weapon - Prince Lassid and Sinbad carry swords, Princess Lisa a magical veil and Afshael a mace. In addition to the weapons, players can also summon a magical attack in the form of a huge genie. The genie will only appear for a few seconds but during that time, players have control over the genie and can steer him towards enemies. 

Arabian Magic has seven different stages with one of the powerful guardians awaiting the player at the end of each level. Each guardian, once defeated, will drop a jewel which forms a part of the Jewel of Seven Colours. Guardians, once defeated, will join the player and become a Genie. Each level is littered with vases and wooden chests which, when broken, reveal treasure items and power-ups. 

The game ends when the player has recovered the Jewel of Seven Colours, saved the King (making him human in the process) and restored peace to Shahariyard.</desc>

		<desc>Arkanoid Returns © 1997 Taito Corp.

The 3rd chapter in Taito's legendary 1 or 2-player bat and ball game, in which players once again control a paddle and must try to rebound a ball into patterns of bricks to remove them from the play area.

Each level is patrolled by enemies and certain bricks, when hit, release power-ups which then roll down the screen and can be collected by the player.

While the 3rd chapter contains 50 brand new levels for players to fight through, the actual gameplay itself remains unaltered from the first 2 games. The only real differences are a revamp of both the graphics and sound, as well as a number of minor enhancements to the in-game power-ups.</desc>

		<desc>In the year 2281, the war spanning half a century over territory between the United World Forces and the Raian Kingdom had at last come to an end.

But this peace was not to last. A year after a truce was signed between the two forces, former Raian army captain Azrael, who has converted himself into a cyborg in an attempt to become "the perfect warrior", has marshalled several thousand other cyborgs and declared war against the Raian Kingdom. Robbing mobile weapons from the army, this group of rogues has invaded the Raian capital of Merkid and has begun to abduct the civilians.

The United World Government, receiving an emergency message from the planet Raia, has but one choice: to organize and dispatch an army formed around its elite corps, a squadron of warriors called "Bloody Armor", to eradicate the enemy forces and rescue the civilians.

And so, in October 2282, the United World Forces begin to launch its attack upon the planet Raia.

The most intense battle in human history is about to begin...</desc>

		<desc>The storyline of Art of Fighting takes place in 1978. Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia set out to find Ryo's sister, Yuri, who was kidnapped by Mr. Big. Mr. Big took Yuri to entice Takuma Sakazaki, Ryo's father and originator of Kyokugen Karate, and also because Ryo refused to work for Big. After Ryo &amp; Robert defeat Mr. Big, they face the enigmatic Mr. Karate. Art of Fighting's story ends with a cliff-hanger; Yuri is about to disclose the true identity of Mr. Karate as their father Takuma.</desc>

		<desc>In this sequel to the original Art of Fighting, and prequel to the original Fatal Fury, we learn that Mr. Karate, the final boss of the original game, behind the mask, is really Takuma Sakazaki, Ryo and Yuri's father, that Takuma was being used by Geese Howard for his own evil intentions, and that Mr. Big was the one who had originally kidnapped Yuri.

Many of the problems that existed in the first game have been fixed in this installment (it is easier to execute special moves, you no longer have only Ryo or Robert to choose from in 1 player mode, etc.).

The entire cast from the first Art of Fighting is here (with the exceptions of Todo and Mr. Karate), along with a few new characters: Takuma Sakazaki, Ryo and Yuri's father; Yuri Sakazaki, Takuma's daughter and Ryo's sister; Eiji Kisaragi, a sworn enemy of the Sakazakis; Temjin, a Mongolian trucker; and a younger version of Geese Howard, whom you face as the last boss if you beat the game without losing a round.</desc>

However, he leaves without the consent of The Garcia Foundation, which sends an agent named Karman Cole to get him back. But not everything is as simple as it looks... because Robert is not the only one looking for Freia.

Art of Fighting 3: The Path of The Warrior features ten playable characters with different fighting styles, a completely new fighting system based on joystick and button combinations, and incredibly detailed graphics and animation.

		<name>Asterix</name>
		<desc>Asterix is a horizontally-scrolling beat-em-up for one or two players and is based on the French comic-book series, 'Asterix &amp; Obelix'. Players fight as either Asterix the Gaul or his best friend, Obelix, as they take on the might of the oppressive Roman Empire. 

Asterix and Obelix each have standard jump/attack controls, as well as a dash attack activated by tapping the joystick forward twice then pressing the attack button. Each character also posesses a powerful spinning arm attack, this is activated by holding the attack button for a short while until the character's face turns red, after which players must release the button. If the button is held down for too long, the character gets out of breath and takes a few seconds to recover.

The heroes' main foes are Roman legionaries and fat - ocassionally horseback riding - centurions. After an enemy has been beaten enough to fall to the ground, he can be picked up and attacked again, the nature of the attack is dependant on which character picks them up; Asterix will spin the stunned enemy above his head, whereas Obelix smashes him repeatedly into the ground. These stunned enemies also act as tempoarary weapons, as they will cause damage to any other enemies they come into contact with.

		<name>Ataxx</name>
		<desc>The object of the game is to fill the 7x7 tiled board with your colored globs. This is done by moving your glob adjacent to your opponent's glob and turning it to your color. 2 types of moves can be made during the game: first, placing a glob adjacent to one of your own duplicates it; or second, a glob may jump two spaces, but it will not be duplicated. The number and arrangement of obstacles in the playfield changes between each round, so strategies must be changed in order to accommodate these barriers.

Eventually, all the empty spaces on the board are filled, and the player with the most colored globs wins. In single-player mode if the human player wins, they must face a more difficult computer opponent in the next round. The game is over when time runs out, regardless if you're winning or not. You can 'buy-in' at any time.</desc>

		<name>Athena</name>
		<desc>This is a pretty hard platform game where you take the role of Athena fighting your way through different worlds inhabited by all kinds of different enemies, ranging from moving pears to huge golems and flying devils.

You start out with nothing more than your feet to fight with and no more protection than Athena's underwear (she actually loses her dress in the intro to the first world) but can collect a huge number of different weapons and armour, as well as a great number of power-ups ranging from the usual more-power-for weapon or armour, through boots that allow her to jump higher and wings for flying, to one where Athena becomes a semi-god and actually growths to twice her usual size and gets a huge burning sword and full armour.

The worlds are filled with stone blocks that can be smashed when searching for secrets and items, as well as several levels connected by ladders or other means of transportation.

Athena is a great game, and will give even the most hardened platform-player a real challenge, for it is NOT an easy game, even with the dip switches in 'Easy' mode.</desc>

		<name>Arabian</name>
		<desc>You'll have 1001 hours of fun with the ARABIAN upright game! You are the adventurous Arabian prince, and your goal is to rescue the princess from her palace. Use the joystick control and the KICK button to move through perilous passages. Sail the seas, crawl in caves, and fly magic carpets - you'll be challenged by 4 increasingly hard waves of play! Score points on the way for picking up the letters in A-R-A-B-I-A-N, and get a bonus if you pick them up in order!

Arabian is a 'video book' with a happy ending! The attract mode introduces the story, and animated storybook 'pages' let you experience the Arabian Prince's adventures. Use the 8-position joystick to jump, super-jump, walk, crawl, or climb in all directions. Tap either KICK button (are you right- or left-handed?) to kick your enemies out of the way.

The player controls a young Arabian Prince who must rescue his Princess from the castle tower where she is being held prisoner. Evil Genies in brass jugs, swooping Rocs, and purple ghostly creatures called Oscars will try to stop him along the way. The Prince scores points for kicking Oscars or Rocs, picking up lettered jugs, or spelling A-R-A-B-I-A-N. The Prince loses a life when he's hit by a smokeball, falls off a ledge, flying carpet or vine, or gets caught (touched) by a Genie, Oscar, or Roc.

The Prince must successfully complete 4 levels to rescue the Princess (4 levels or 'pages' equals 1 section). Each level is introduced with the turning of a page, which shows a distant view of the upcoming playfield. Each playfield has 7 lettered jugs that must be picked up before the player can advance to the next level, but he must avoid or KICK evil Genies, Oscars, and Rocs that will try to stop him.

		<desc>After a sudden alien assault, the Arkanoid spaceship has been destroyed and the only survivor, the small 'Vaus' space vessel, has been mysteriously trapped in another dimension by an unknown enemy. The player is charged with helping the 'Vaus' overcome the security systems, as well as the many enemies that guard them, before finally finding and destroying 'DOH', the alien responsible for the attack.

Arkanoid is an update of the early ball and paddle video games - and specifically of Atari's 1978 classic, "Super Breakout" - in which the player takes control of a paddle at the bottom of the screen and must use it to deflect a ball into rows of bricks at the top of the screen, thus destroying them and, eventually, clearing the screen to progress to the next level. 

As well as impressive and colourful graphics, Arkanoid introduced a number of new elements to the classic bat 'n' ball gameplay. Certain bricks, when destroyed, would release a power-up - in the form of a falling capsule. the player had to catch the capsule to retrieve the power-up. Among the many enhancements the power-ups provided were an increased 'bat' size, multiple balls, 'sticky' ball (which would stick to the bat and could be released when the player chose) and even a laser, which allowed the player to shoot the bricks.</desc>

Missiles are used to destroy ground enemies, while laser-like weapons are used for aerial opponents. Throughout each of the levels, the player must fight off waves of enemies that threaten several space stations and a boss must be defeated at the end of each. Like most early games in this genre, when the player dies, all weapons are lost and the player is moved to a point slightly before the point of death. The player's craft can also be upgraded to have more powerful weapons by picking up various power-ups throughout the level.</desc>

A fleet of savage beings followed the radiation wave and invaded the planet, and began the systematic destruction of all remaining sentient life. Years of battling the alien 'governors' have gone by, and now only one hope survives to avenge the desperate Terran colonists.

The player controls the Atomic Robo-Kid through six stages of increasing difficulty, facing an alien "governor" boss, which are so large as to be considered levels themselves, followed by a "duel" level against other Robo-Kid sized robots. Many levels branch into others, giving the player the choice over which zone to enter next, increasing replayability.

Robo-Kid can collect four different weapons. Whichever weapon is selected is lost when Robo-kid loses a life. In addition to his default gun, Robo-Kid is able collect powerups for a shield that activates on enemy contact, rapid fire, and speed powerups. The player can also encounter a friendly dinosaur-looking robot that sells weapons and shields to Robo-kid using extra lives as currency.</desc>

		<name>Avenging Spirit</name>
		<desc>While walking out with his girlfriend the game's hero is ambushed by unknown enemies who snatch his girlfriend and shoot the hero dead. Now, as a wandering spirit with the ability to possess almost anybody he comes across, the hero is summoned by his girlfriend's father and given a mission to save her from the mysterious crime syndicate that holds her hostage. Only then can the hero rest in peace.

The player's character 'inhabits' a body with which to combat the game's enemies. When that body is killed, providing there is a living enemy nearby (other than that of a boss) the player can posses them and continue playing. Each time this is done, it costs the player some of their 'spirit energy'. Should the hero die when there are no enemies close by for the player to possess; the game is over.</desc>

Along the way, players must refuel their patrol car (by driving through filling stations) as well as meeting targets within a set time limit. Any accidental collisions or running over of pedestrians will result in the player earning 'de-merits', while a 'perfect day' will earn bonuses, with further bonuses awarded for each arrest made that exceeds the daily quota. Picking up donuts extends the time limit for a day.</desc>

The player's ship is always presented in the center of the screen, and as the player moves left and right, the ground actually scrolls in the opposite direction. The player can continue scrolling all the way in one direction and end up back where he or she started.

Other new concepts include walls of mazes that float in the air which may be optionally traveled through. Certain ground targets provide power-ups or special weapons, but they must be bombed 3 times in order to earn them. A boss sequence occurs at the end of each stage. The boss has one infrequently exposed weak spot that only takes one bomb to destroy, but the boss will leave after an allotted time if the player does not succeed. There is a landing sequence after the boss fight that must be successfully maneuvered for bonus points. And finally, the ship receives a new weapons at each stage (5 distinct combinations which cycle).</desc>

		<name>Assault</name>
		<desc>Your mission is to reclaim your homeland by destroying the enemy forces that have taken over. You have an Assault tank, the supreme mobile weapon. Your tank has artillery guns and grenades, can perform Rapid Rolls to dodge enemy shots, and uses Power Wheelies to launch grenades.

Your controls are two 4-position joysticks with triggers. These controls make Assault like no other tank game. You have a quick, highly responsive vehicle with fast movement in all directions. To avoid enemy shots, Rapid Roll your tank left or right by moving both joysticks to the same side. To launch grenades, put the tank in the Power Wheelie position by moving both joysticks to the outside, then pressing either trigger. Your grenades are triple the fire power of your tank's standard shots.

Your tank is always in the center of the screen no matter what direction you are going. With Assault's 360-degree scrolling playfield, the world rotates around you as you move. An arrow always points you towards the exit to the next level.

The lift zone gives you an advantage over the invaders and a spectacular view of the playfield. Each lift zone is a five-sided platform on the playfield that flashes red when you can use it. When you drive onto the lift zone, your tank jets straight up to get a bird's eye view of the surrounding terrain and enemy lines. From this overhead position, you can reconnoiter enemy forces and bomb enemy outposts.

Fight your way through 11 different levels to seek out and destroy the invaderâs headquarters. To succeed, you must:
Dodge enemy gunfire with the Rapid Roll maneuver.
Assault enemy lines with long-range powerful grenades launched from Power Wheelies.
Destroy all enemy tanks you encounter to prevent rear attacks.
Bomb enemy outposts and reconnoiter enemy emplacements using the lift zones.
Protect yourself against enemy artillery using buildings and trees.
Blow up the large cannons on each level while you avoid enemy attacks.
Follow the arrow to find the exit to the next level. Before you can exit, you must destroy the large cannons defending the enemy strongholds.</desc>

		<name>Bakutotsu Kijuutei</name>
		<desc>Bakutotsu Kijuutei is the sequel to BaRaDuKe, which was released three years earlier. As in the original game, the player must take control of a spaceman in a bio-suit (who is a caricature of a Namco employee) while fighting the strange-looking Octy and saving the one-eyed Paccets - except this time Player 1 is Takky and Player 2 is Hommy. The Paccets that the spacemen collect during the stage now come in two different colours (yellow and white), and will circle around them, and the yellow ones will also add to their scores at the end of the stage (for 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000 and 7650 points in succession) instead of featuring in the bonus game, which now only happens before a boss stage; however, the white ones will not, because they cannot be killed. If a yellow Paccet is accidentally shot or killed by an enemy, he will explode and send his eyeball flying - and if the player catches the eyeball he will receive a single point. Several new enemies have also been introduced (one of which, the "Block Brain", first appeared in Beraboh Man, and another, the "Black Paccet", is an evil version of the Paccets); the boss for the thirtieth stage, "Dark Paccet", is also an enormous evil version of the Paccets. If the player defeats Dark Paccet on his first try, the game shall not end - instead, six more stages will have to be played, and if a player wins the game (regardless of if it ends on Stage 30 or 36), he will not be able to enter his name on its high score table. There are now four different types of capsules; as a general rule, the yellow ones contain Paccets, while the red ones contain Baganns (the Pac-Man-like aliens from the original title), the blue ones contain shot powerups, and the green ones contain speed powerups. It is also now impossible to move backwards (like in Super Mario Bros.) - but if the player dies, he will be sent back to the beginning of the stage (unlike in the original, where he would restart in the place where he died) and be reprimanded by the "Paccet Ojisan", who also appears for the start of some stages to give him advice.</desc>

There are two difficulties of play: Beginner, which automatically fields the ball for the player while Exciting has the player do the field manually.  Additionally, there are two main modes of play where in the single player mode the player will compete in a fifteen-team tournament or go head-to-head against a friend in a multiplayer mode.

The standard rules of baseball still apply, but it adds power-ups that the player can pick up and use during the game, such as the ability for their pitcher to throw faster or their batter to hit better.  They can also substitute a player during the game, but are limited to three substitutions per game. The game is shown through 2D graphics with comic-style cutscenes to illustrate the action, such as dramatic catches and home runs that will pop-up during the game.</desc>

		<name>Batsugun</name>
		<desc>A vertically scrolling shoot'em up game. As is the standard with most arcade shooters, the player controls their ship with a joystick and two buttons. One button (Fire) shoots the main guns, and the other button (Bomb) releases a smart bomb that spreads huge energy balls all around the player's ship.

As enemies are destroyed, the player gains experience points that are separate from the score. For every 288 experience points gained, the main gun will 'level up', becoming much stronger. This is analogous to experience points and leveling up in role playing games. The weapon can only level up twice, so after it has achieved its maximum level, 288 experience points will grant the player an extra bomb.

The player can also grab P icons to increase the power of the current level gun. A maximum of five "P"s can be collected per experience level; getting more after this gives extra points instead.

Collecting B icons increases the number of bombs, to a maximum of 7.

Apart from destroying enemies, points can be gained from collecting golden V-shaped medals. After the level is finished, 3000 points are awarded for every small one, and 5000 points for every large one. If the player's ship is destroyed during a level, all medals collected are lost.</desc>

		<desc>The game focuses mostly on reality fighting than fictional. At the start of the game in 1P mode, the player will face against the other fighter that uses the same fighting style as the one the player chose. After the player wins against the opponent, the player will face against other opponents that use other fighting styles in the K-Road Tournament. If the player loses, the game will only allow the player to continue fighting through it with the character he used, and will not allow the player to choose another character.

The gameplay has a 6-button layout, but with command inputs different compared to ones in most fighting games released at the time. There are three punches and kicks for a few directions (weak, medium and strong). There are seven fighting styles featured in the game and two playable characters per style, for a total of 14 playable fighters.</desc>

		<desc>Battlezone is a classic one-player first person 3-D wire frame shoot-em-up in which the player controls a tank patrolling a dangerous war zone. Set in a valley surrounded by mountains, the aim is to destroy as many enemy tanks as possible, while avoiding return fire and destroying or avoiding the homing missiles that occasionally appear.

Enemy tanks come in two varieties; standard slow-moving tanks and fast-moving 'Super Tanks'. A single hit taken from either an enemy tank or homing missile will result in the loss of a player tank. A flying saucer also occasionally appears but does not attack the player and can be either ignored or destroyed for bonus points.

A radar screen at the top of the play area shows the current position of any enemy tanks or missiles within range, and the war zone is littered with indestructible pyramids and boxes that can provide temporary cover. Only a single shot is allowed on screen at any one time so accuracy of shots is vital to survival.</desc>

The subtitle of this game translates from Japanese as 'Unequaled Man'.

This game is called 'Berabow Man' by Namco though this is likely a mistranslation as the later NEC PC-Engine port is called 'Bravoman'. The name 'BERABOW' appears in the default high score list.

In Stage 8, the main character from "Pistol-Shogun - Pistol Daimyo no Bouken" (which was released 2 years later) must be fought.

Bravoman did a cameo appearance in Namco x Capcom released for the Sony PS2 in 2005.</desc>

The Humanoid can be killed either by a single shot from a robot, by running into a robot, by running into a wall of the maze, or by being touched by the player's nemesis, 'Evil Otto'.

To advance through the game, players must fight their way through each room to an opening at one of the far walls. Each robot destroyed is worth 50 points and while it's possible to progress without killing every robot in each room, destroying all of them will earn the player a per-maze bonus (worth ten points per robot). The game has an impressive 64,000 mazes, with each level designed to be more difficult than the last.</desc>

The fighters to choose from are Tom, Hawk, Shalin, the wrestler Abdul, the Rambo like Scott, the Japanese Sasaki, the punker Tango and the turban wearing Alli. Each fighter has their own fighting techniques witch include kick, punch and special attacks. The fights are best of three and after each fight a new fighter can be selected. You can play solo or with a friend. This would be a typical early Street Fighter clone if it wasn't for the good old SunA wackyness. Eight combatants come to this turney to find out who is the best of the best in the world. Like in many Korean fighting games at the time, there is no boss, nor any hidden characters. Each character has its own stage, but the same musical tunes are played in each of them. Get ready to fight to the rythm of Lambada and celebrate your victory with the Ode to Joy.</desc>

Moving forward will cause the screen will scroll faster. This is necessary because you have a oxygen bar that will cost you one life if it runs out. 
Be sure to pick up oxygen capsules by flying over them. This refills the timer and gains you 100 points. </desc>

		<desc>While the game is essentially a standard horizontally scrolling shoot'em up, it has an innovation that makes it unique in the genre. The player flies a spaceship (specifically, a bioship) which has the standard forward guns to be found in all horizontal scrollers, but it also possesses a weapon that can be manually targeted with a crosshair, in the same manner as in the game "Missile Command". This allows the player to fire in any direction with pinpoint accuracy, and adds an extra level of strategy to the game. The player's bioship can also collect power-ups to grow bigger (becoming more powerful), and can acquire spherical pods which attach to the ship and increase its firepower.</desc>

		<name>Black Dragon</name>
		<desc>Black Dragon/Tiger is a scrolling platform shoot-em-up set in a fantasy world and is the spiritual successor to the Capcom classic, "Makaimura" ("Ghosts'n' Goblins" outside Japan).

The player takes on the role of a barbarian hero who must jump and fight his way through a variety of colourful, enemy-packed levels, collecting treasure and weapon power-ups and rescuing the trapped 'wise old men' that litter the levels. 

Rescuing the wise men sees the player awarded 'Zeny coins'; these are the game's currency and allow the player to buy such items as weapon and armour upgrades, keys for treasure chests, anti-poisoning potions and health potions from the shops that appear on each level. Occasionally, a rescued wise man will also offer to sell the player weapon and armour power-ups. 

The barbarian hero is armed with a spiked mace on the end of a long chain, as well as unlimited throwing daggers. Both these and the armour worn by the barbarian (which offers limited protection from enemy attacks) can be upgraded by finding or buying the relevant power-ups.

The sprawling, eight-way scrolling levels are packed with hidden bonuses to encourage and reward exploration. These bonuses are in the form of weapon and armour power-ups, as well as valuable treasure items. Many levels also include a hidden dungeon and each dungeon is filled with both bonus items and trapped wise men.

Special items that reveal coins, upgraded armour, or simply bonus points can be found by attacking certain walls.</desc>

		<desc>Blast Off is a vertically scrolling shoot'em up. Despite the drastically different gameplay, Blast Off is the sequel to Bosconian which was released eight years earlier.

As in many other vertical scrolling shooters (including Namco's own Xevious), the player controls a ship, facing the top of the screen, that can move freely while the background scrolls down, bringing enemies in to view; the player may destroy enemies for points. The game uses two buttons - one is used to make the ship fire circular lasers, while the other is used to cycle through its four firing patterns. The red pattern is two lasers in a spiral pattern, while the blue one is one laser straight ahead and one behind, the yellow one is one laser straight ahead, one left, and one right and the green one is two lasers diagonally forward (one to the left and one to the right), and one straight behind; by holding down the button, the ship fires more powerful, spherical lasers.</desc>

		<desc>The player takes control of a spaceship and must fight against wave after wave of enemy fighters, while trying to rescue the stranded astronauts that represent the last surviving remnants of the human race. Enemies attack the player both with weapons, and by making 'suicide runs' at the player's ship. The game consists of eleven different levels, nine of which are repeated, bringing the total number of levels to 20. 

The levels are: Planetoid Waves, Robot Grid Waves, Saucerland Waves, Vampire Waves, Time Tunnel Waves, Outer Space Waves, Enduro Waves, Cat World Waves, and Mastermind Waves (there are two of each of these). 

There are also two unique waves that occur only once, they are Armageddon and Paradise. 

Players can select their starting wave at the start of the game; choosing from Planetoids, Robot Grid, Saucerland, and Vampires. During the game, players must be careful to NOT shoot the human astronauts that drift through the levels. These must be rescued by 'running' into them. 

Despite the presence of an energy meter, the player can take exactly three hits before he or she dies. Upon death, the window of the player's virtual cockpit breaks and one of the player's lives is lost. Blaster has a 'Continue' option but this can only be used once.</desc>

		<desc>The player is set in control of The Garland TFF-01, a sub-standard space fighter ship that is only armed with a semi-auto or rapid fire laser gun known as the Beam Vulcan and the Tranquilander. Some enemy units can be captured and used in play; certain enemy robots, when shot by the player's Tranquilander, will morph into an outline of themselves. The player can then fly into the outline, and take on the form of the enemy robot, taking control of its weapons, abilities and special attacks.

There is also addition to the boss battle scoring: similar to some shooters, players have the opportunity to increase their scores by beating the end level bosses within a certain time limit. Every time a boss battle is initiated, a timer will count down and once the boss is destroyed/killed before the timer reaches zero, then the time left will add to the player's end-level score; if the timer runs out, then the score at the end of the level will remain unaffected.</desc>

		<name>Block Out</name>
		<desc>Block Out is a 1-player or a simultaneous 2 players competitive game of unique dimensional action and strategy.
As the blocks drop one-by-one into the three-dimensional pit, rotate them by using the three buttons and joystick. Once the player has decided on the the rotation of the block, use the button to drop the block into place. The objective is to place the blocks into the pit without leaving any empty spaces. Once this is achieved, the layers without empty spaces, will disappear.

The player begins the game by selecting a starting stage. Game start level select can be chosen from stages 1, 5, 10, 15, or 20. There is a total of 100 stages in the game and as the players progress through the game, the stages get more and more difficult.
Each stage has a certain number of layers (faces) that must be erased. Once these faces are erased, the player will move on to the next stage. The less blocks the players has left in the pit at the end of the stage, the more points are awarded.

In addition to the one player mode, Block Out offers a competitive simultaneous two player mode. The split screen effect gives each player their own pit with which to play in. They compete against each other in the race to erase the faces. As one player erases a face, that face will be added to the opponent's pit, making their pit rise. This allows less room to work. There are two ways to win in the 2-player mode:
1) Force the opponent to the top of their pit and out of the game
or
2) Erase 21 faces first.</desc>

		<desc>The planet of Raguy was once beautiful and peaceful, but all hell broke loose when it was invaded by the Daruma tribe. The pollution started to spread through the city. Blue was summoned to get rid of the Daruma tribe, and save Raguy from the Daruma Empire that has turned the inhabitants into slaves.

You control Blue, who only has one weapon to deal with the Darumas. You can use his leaf to whip enemies upside-down, and hurl these enemies at others. Along the way, you can get flowers for use at the shop to buy items that will help you along the way. These items include flower honey (increases stamina), swim fins (easier swimming), light safe (protects all your items), spikes, and ocarinas. Later in the game, you can also get the shopkeeper to sing you a song. This helps you break curses that are placed on you by a witch.You will also interact with other characters along the way that can also help you if you tell the truth.

You exit each stage by jumping on a huge plant. The higher up you are on this plant, the more points you are awarded. Every two or so stages, you have to defeat a boss before a guy in a devil suit offers you something. You can refuse or accept the other. If you accept the offer, you will have to pull one of four strings that will give you a life ball, more stamina, 30 flowers, cocoons, or five flowers.

You are on a time limit. If you run out of time, a black creature appears out of nowhere, and starts firing "bird" missiles at you.</desc>

		<desc>This is a horizontally scrolling shoot'em up in which the player drives an armoured car, equipped with a front-mounted gun and super jump capability. The aim of the game is to fight through five enemy-controlled zones to retrieve a stolen top-secret fighter plane, the PK430.

The game's levels force-scroll from right to left, although the vehicle's speed - and rate of scrolling - can be slowed down and speeded up to some degree. As well as a forward-firing gun, the car can be made to jump huge distances. This is necessary to avoid background obstacles such as rock falls and broken bridges. It can also be used to avoid incoming enemy fire and vehicles. Land mines also litter the levels and need to be shot or avoided.</desc>

Bub and Bob are armed only with the ability to blow bubbles, in which the game's many enemies can be trapped and killed. The bubbles can also be used as temporary platforms, to help the dinosaurs reach previously inaccessible areas of a level. 

Any trapped enemies who are not killed quickly enough will turn red and escape their bubble prison. These angry enemies are much faster than before, making them harder to kill. Enemies also become angry if players are taking too long to complete a level. Defeated enemies are turned into bonus fruit items that can be collected for points. </desc>

Graphically, the game is very similar to 'Bobble Bobble II', released a year earlier; the only real visual difference between the two is the latter game's use of some rather charmless digitized animal photographs that form the game's backdrops.</desc>

		<desc>Caliber Fifty is a multi-directional scrolling shoot-em-up for one or two players taking on the roles of captured US pilots who have been taken prisoner during the Vietnam war in 1972. The pilots must escape the prison compound by battling enemy soldiers and vehicles, including tanks planes and helicopters.

The game is very similar in play to SNK's Ikari and Heavy Barrel games, with players able to fully rotate their on-screen characters to fire and move in all directions. Players are initially armed with a machine gun and limited number of grenades but power-ups - including a rocket launcher, a flamethrower and grenades - can be found in the destructible wooden crates that litter the stages. 

Enemy vehicles such as a plane can also be commandeered and the stages take place both above ground in the Vietnamese jungles and below ground in hidden tunnels. Caliber Fifty is a quite short but very challenging game, with constantly spawning enemies attacking from all sides.</desc>

Each maze must be completed within a tight time limit and a number of traps and obstacles litter the mazes to slow players down.

There are, however, a number of positive targets to be hit, and bonuses - such as additional time - can be found hidden away within the mazes. When the ball is stuck or the player would like to speed up, the JUMP button can be used. If the player runs out of time before reaching the goal, a random matching game is run to allow the player more time to complete the maze. This challenge, however is very difficult to win.</desc>

Misses are counted as the times you do not hit any rocks. The scores for the rocks are directly proportional to the difficulty in hitting those rocks. This game boils down to precision bombing and thinking ahead as to where the next bomb will fall. Good luck in taking out all of the rocks in the canyon.</desc>

Two rows of bullets at the bottom of the screen indicate the number of shots remaining to the player. Every time the player shoots, one of the bullets disappears from the screen. More bullets are given during the first round than the others, so, the inexperienced player will have a chance to enjoy the play.

Their mission is to quell an alien invasion which is spanning all of the Milky Way and destroy the alien headquarters: the Danger-Seed.

The player starts the game with three separate fighters and has to make it through four tubes using the fighters separately. If one gets destroyed, then the next, more powerful ship makes an attempt to get through. If the player makes it to the fifth stage, the three ships combine into a singular composite ship called the "Moon Diver", which has a massive amount of firepower.</desc>

		<name>Darwin 4078</name>
		<desc>The game takes place within a gigantic spaceship which has virtually infinite capacity because of its ability to manipulate time and space. The player must deal with enigmatic creatures called EVOL, which consist only of pure energy and need to keep themselves in capsules in order to maintain their existence in the world.

All of the characters in the game are designed to resemble microscopic organisms, both in their appearance and their quick, tricky movements. The player's ship undergoes over 10 types of transformations throughout the game, each with offensive and defensive maneuvers specific to their design. The sound effects used are minimal, but different types of sounds are used according to the type of shots or their speed. A sound resembling a long scream results when the player's ship is hit and returns to its weakest evolutionary state.

The player must progress through 16 different levels, defeating the boss at the end of each level. The player controls their ship using an 8-way joystick and 2 buttons (one button targets enemies in the air, and the other targets the enemies on the ground). The power of the player's ship increases as it evolves.

There are two broad categories that define how enemies attack. The first type only shoots in the forward direction at a constant speed, but the second type shoots bullets that travel at different speeds depending on its distance with the player's ship (the bullets travel quicker if the player is farther away, and slower if the player is close by). This makes it so that staying away from enemies will not necessarily make it easier to avoid attacks. The game's difficulty also does not change over time, and enemies do not become stronger as the player's ship evolves.</desc>

		<name>Defender</name>
		<desc>Defender is a legendary sideways-scrolling shoot-em-up - the very first of its genre - in which the aim is to pilot a laser-firing spaceship and protect humanoids stranded on the planet's surface from swarms of alien abductors.

A long-range scanner at the top of the screen shows the positions of both the humanoids and the attacking aliens. The ideal strategy is to shoot down the alien ships before they reach the humanoids. If a humanoid is captured, the alien abductor can still be destroyed, but the player must then catch the falling humanoid and return it to the safety of the planet's surface before it falls to its death.

If an alien is allowed to carry its victim to the very top of the screen, the humanoid will mutate, becoming a permanent part of the alien that captured it. This new and deadly mutation will then immediately join in the alien attack.

The challenge becomes more intense as action progresses. Fighter ships and their mines will soon join the abductors. There are also mother ships that must be destroyed; these are particularly difficult as a direct hit smashes the mother ship into a swarming mass of mini-ships that must also be wiped out. Throughout the entire mission, the player must act quickly or face possible destruction by the cosmic baiter, a fast and dangerous enemy.

Players have two escape options to use as a last resort. The first is the 'smart bomb', which destroys all on-screen enemies. The second option is 'hyperspace', which randomly teleports the player's ship to another part of the level. This is highly risky as it may place the player's ship in a position more dangerous than the one it left.

If all humanoids are successfully abducted, the planet will explode in a blinding flash and the waves remaining until the next planet is reached take place in outer space, and consist solely of destroying enemy waves.</desc>

		<desc>An arcade puzzle game in which a single player must tunnel their way through a number of underground caves, collecting the many gems spread throughout the levels. Each cave is littered with rocks which, should they fall onto the player, will result in a loss of life. Carefully planned tunnels can be dug to manipulate the direction in which the rocks fall, however, which makes them an effective weapon against the many enemies that populate the levels. A number of red explosives can be found which can also be used to kill enemies and also to destroy any walls blocking the player's path. Again, like the rocks, these must be used carefully to prevent the explosion from killing the player.

In order to complete a level, a specified number of gems must be collected. Once a sufficient amount of gems have been collected, an exit will open which the player must enter to proceed to the next cave.

Diamond Run is heavily based on First Star's Commodore C64 classic, 'Boulder Dash'.</desc>

		<name>Diet Go Go</name>
		<desc>Diet Go Go is a single-screen platform game for one or two players, in which the aim is to clear each screen of monsters and avoid getting fat. Monsters are defeated by throwing food at them until they inflate (get fat), then touching them to burst them, sending them flying around the screen and killing any other monsters they come into contact with. Many monsters also throw food at the players, making them increasingly fat. If players get too fat, they lose a life, although bonus diet sodas occasionally appear and can be picked up to reverse the effect. Contact with monsters who aren't fully inflated is fatal. 

When monsters are destroyed, they leave behind rings, gems, power-ups and diet tonic. Power-ups include roller-skates to move faster, compressed air to blow monsters up and increased fire power. Data East coins also appear on each level. If players collect these coins, they shoot up to the top of the screen where a fruit machine display rolls over and dispenses gems, power-ups and rings. If the fruit machine reads 777, a bonus round appears in which players jump on clouds to collect falling gems while avoiding the falling food that will make them fat.

The game starts with one player selecting an area on a world map, then progresses through two levels of play to reach a giant boss on the third round. After the boss is destroyed that world is complete and play moves onto the next. Each world has a different theme and boss.</desc>

		<desc>For this sequel to the 1982 classic, "Dig Dug", Namco changed the game's perspective from a cutaway side-on viewpoint to an overhead one. The action now takes place on a series of small islands, the gameplay itself retains much from its predecessor, with Dig Dug still being chased by the 'Pookas' (round, goggle-wearing red enemies) and the 'Fygers' (green, fire-breathing dragons).

As with the first game, Dig Dug is still armed with a pump that allows him to inflate and burst the enemies. For the sequel, however, he is also armed with a jackhammer. This can be used at the round ground-pegs scattered around each island to create and connect up fault lines in the ground. If both ends of a system of faults reaches the water, the ground surrounded by them will sink into the ocean killing all creatures on it, including Dig Dug himself if he is standing on the destroyed section of land.</desc>

		<name>Do! Run Run</name>
		<desc>A superb final entry into the "Mr Do!" series (not counting the Neo Geo-based "Neo Mr. Do", which was merely a remake of the first game in the series), "Do! Run Run" takes its inspiration from Namco's "Pac-Man".

As in his previous games, Mr Do! must once again collect coloured dots and/or fruit while avoiding or killing a number of enemies. For the fourth Mr Do! outing, Universal ditched the sideways viewpoint of the series' previous games and switched to an overhead perspective. This allowed the game to give an impression of 'depth', with slopes and steps affecting Mr Do!'s mobility and speed.

Mr. Do. has two items at his disposal with which he can kill the his enemies. The first is the 'Powerball', which featured in the original 'Mr. Do!' but was dropped from the first two sequels. The Powerball can be shot directly at an enemy to kill it instantly.

The second offensive option is provided in the form of the large wooden logs that litter the levels. These work in the same way as the apples did in the original game, and can be pushed free of their supporting struts, causing them to roll down the screen and kill everything in their path, including Mr. Do. himself if he strays too near.

As Mr Do! moves around a screen, he trails a line behind him. Players can join the two ends of the line up to form a rectangle (in a similar fashion to Taito's 1981 classic, "Qix") which will change any dots within the rectangle into cherries. A second rectangle can be drawn around the cherries which in turn will change them into apples. This can be repeated twice more, changing apples into lemons, and lemons into pineapples. The better the fruit, the more bonus points Mr Do! will earn when he collects them.</desc>

The penguin can push the egg left or right and can jump on it to make sure it doesn't get stuck against a wall. Digging affects the tile one block away from the penguin's position, making it impossible to dig directly downwards. If the egg gets into a position where it cannot be moved left or right, jumping and landing on it will cause it to smash. </desc>

		<name>Domino Man</name>
		<desc>The player controls Domino Man, a bespectacled, moustachioed artist who must set up a chain of giant dominoes across the screen, to form a chain of dominoes which can then be toppled.

The dominoes must be placed on sites marked by black spots, achieved by simply running over each spot. Once all of the spots are covered with a domino, the chain is complete. The player will then have the choice of either knocking them all down to clear the level, or simply wait for a few seconds to continue to the next screen, in hope of completing the chain on THAT level, and so on. In this way, the player can set up several chains and knock them all down in one fell swoop, earning many bonus points in the process. Multiple chains are, of course, very difficult to achieve.

Domino Man's progress is hampered by a neighborhood bully who walks onto the screen and tries to knock over the first dominoes he comes across. The player must either try to complete and topple the chain of dominoes before the bully knocks them over, or hit the bully with a domino; causing the bully's trousers to fall down and disabling him for a few seconds. A killer bee also appears, and if it manages to sting the player, a life is lost. A bag lady and a boy pushing a shopping cart wander blindly around the levels, occasionally knocking over some of the dominoes. Domino Man can hit them, however, causing them to change direction.

Once a game is over, a poem is displayed on-screen to evaluate the player's performance on the game. For example:
Roses are red
Or so goes the verse
You set up fifty-two
You could have done worse.</desc>

The player assumes the role of a pilot who is sent by their squadron to fight their former allies until one side destroys the other, all of which is a part of a mission to strengthen the military power that controls each side. The player flies their selected fighter over 5 areas of various terrain, encountering a number of land, sea and air enemies. The player's ship has two modes of fire: by tapping the fire button, shots are fired; holding it down produces a concentrated vertical beam, but also reduces the ship's speed.

The player can choose one of 3 aircraft at the start of the game, or upon continuing:
Type A: A red (or yellow/orange, for player two) fighter, which fires a narrow stream of shots
Type B: A green (or purple, for player two) helicopter, which fires its main guns forward, but has side guns that rotate in the direction of movement
Type C: A blue (or black, for player two) fighter, which fires a wide, three-way spread of shots</desc>

		<name>Double Dragon 3 - The Rosetta Stone</name>
		<desc>A mysterious fortune teller warns Billy &amp; Jimmy Lee about the rise of a powerful enemy in Egypt. Since the Lee brothers are looking for a true challenge to put their martial arts skills to the ultimate test, they agree to face this mysterious new enemy. They embark on a world quest - joining up with new allies in the process - and try to lay claim to the famous 'Rosetta Stone'.

The 3rd and final arcade entry of the Double Dragon series (not counting the later Neo-Geo fighting game based on the movie) features a completely gameplay system and graphics from the first two installments. The game can played by up to 2 or 3 players, depending on the cabinet and settings. The 3rd player takes control of a yellow-clad Lee brother named Sonny, who is exclusive to this game. Techniques from the previous games such as the hair grab and the elbow punch are gone, but new ones are added such as the belly-to-back throw and the back-to-back hurricane kick, as well as the ability to dash by tapping the joystick left or right twice.

The game features weapon shops that allows the player to purchase power-ups by inserting additional tokens. The power-ups differ between stages differ between stages and are available as followed.
Extra Guys - Allows the player to control a new character who replaces the current fighter when he dies. There are three character types in addition to the Lee brothers.
The Urquidez Brothers (Roney, Sunny, Jonny) -  Tall European grapplers. They have the most energy of the four character types.  Up to three fighters can be have in reserve.
The Chin Brothers (Seimei, Taimei, Sinmei) - Chubby Chinese men with powerful attacks.
The Oyama Brothers (Masao, Kunio, Akira) - Japanese karate masters dressed in gis specializing in speedy attacks.
? Tricks - The hurricane kick and the one-armed stand head butt are added to the player's move set. If the player's current character dies, then the new techniques will be inherited by the next character in reserve, if there is one.
Weapons - A nunchaku or sword are given player. Only the Lees can have purchase and wield weapons.
Energy - Restores the current character's life to 150%.
Power-Up - Increases the character's agility.

There are 5 stages in the game:

Mission 1 - America - The enemies in this stage are typical thugs and bikers. The first area takes place in a downtown area of city. After defeating the first wave of enemies, the player will enter a warehouse, where they encounter bikers that will try to run over them with their bike. The boss in this is Jim, a red-haired biker wearing a leather jacket.

Mission 2 - China - The enemies are martial artists that specialize in flying kicks. The stage takes place in a single level set in a countryside near the Great Wall of China. The boss at the end of level is Li Cheng-Long, a Shaolin Martial Arts expert who resembles Bruce Lee. When he's down in life, he will wield out his club.

Mission 3 - Japan - The enemies are samurai swordsmen. The first area takes place outside a castle, with bamboo traps and enemies coming out of walls. The second area takes place inside a castle, where the player will face a few more swordsmen before taking out on the boss, Ranzou, a ninja. He attacks with throwing stars and smoke bombs and splits into three forms when he's down on his life.

Mission 4 - Italy - Consists of a single level set in the ruins of a coliseum. The enemies are roman archers. After defeating most of the archers, the boss Giuliano, a man decked in gladiator armor, will attempt to run the player over with his horse. After defeating all the archers, Giuliano will dismount at the end of the level and fight the player. He wields a long hand spear and can block attacks with his shield.

Mission 5 - Egypt - The final stage is composed of seven levels, which includes a desert field, an underground forest, a trap room with stone pillars and giant hands emerging from the floor, a hall with a flying disc. Enemies include living tree men and rock creatures.</desc>

		<desc>An early platform game in which the player must defeat a mad scientist, avoiding and destroying his evil creations in the process.

The game consists of 3 single-screen levels:

On the first the player must move from the left to the right of the screen, dropping down onto constantly moving metal pillars and shooting the enemies.

On the second level, the player must steer a floating ball around the screen, killing as many enemies as possible. Once enough enemies have been killed, an exit will open which the player must enter. The floating ball gradually diminishes and the player will have to drop to the bottom of the screen several times to get a replacement ball.

The final screen takes place on the scientist's production line; with machinery that must be carefully negotiated. Two large robots bar the route to the scientist and must be destroyed before the scientist can be reached.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Breed</name>
		<desc>Dragon Breed is a side-scrolling shoot-em-up in which the player controls the game's hero, Kayus, who is riding on the back of a fully articulated dragon named 'Bahamoot'. The dragon is immune to enemy attacks, capable of blocking most projectiles and of damaging and eventually killing enemies on contact. Dragon rider Kayus is armed with a forward-firing crossbow but unlike his steed, is not invulnerable and will be killed by contact with either enemies or their projectiles. 

What separates Dragon Breed from other games in the genre is in how the Dragon can be utilised. Bahamoot's body is flexible and responds to Kayus' movement, enabling Kayus to use Bahamoot as both a mobile shield and a whip-like weapon. It's also possible to encircle the tail around a group of enemies to kill them. The tail of the yellow or blue dragon can be coiled around the dragon's rider to offer almost complete invulnerability for a limited time.

Bahamoot can also spit fireballs. By holding the fire button down, the dragon will build up fire in its mouth; the longer the button is held down, the more powerful the fireball will be. There are four levels of fireball power and at its strongest, the fireball resembles a dragon's head.

Power-ups appear in the form of orbs, acquired by shooting small green dragons that appear intermittently throughout stages. There are four different types of orbs, each of will change Bahamoot to a different colour and grant him a new attack power: 
Red orb enables the dragon to breathe a flame. 
Gold orb enables Bahamoot's body to fire crescents in all directions. 
Silver orb enables the dragon to produce up to four miniature dragons, which home in on enemies. 
Blue orb enables Bahamoot to fire bolts of electricity downwards from its underside. 

The player can enhance a specific power by picking up the same type of orb, this can be done up to three times. 

Dragon Breed also includes platforming elements. At certain points during a stage horizontal platforms appear, these often have power-ups on them and the dragon rider can dismount and run along the platforms while the dragon waits above.</desc>

Empieza eligiendo una de las selecciones nacionales disponibles para comenzar la "subida" hacia el último nivel. No hay modo de eliminación directa con grupos de salida y así sucesivamente, pero para terminar el juego tienes que vencer a todos los demás equipos consecutivamente. Un partido dura 3 minutos y en caso de empate se pasa directamente al penalty.</desc>

		<desc>Dyna Gear is a scrolling platform run 'n' gun game for one or two players in which two starships from the year 2993 AD fall through a time-hole and end up 65 million years in the past, above a prehistoric Earth-like planet. One ship is piloted by hero and 'time patroller', Roger, while the other is piloted by the evil Gustaf. The two ships shoot each down and crash-land onto the planet below, where Roger discovers that Gustaf has transformed many of the planet's dinosaurs into aggressive 'combat dinosaurs'. 

Players take control of either the muscular hero, Roger, or of Wolf; a bipedal wolfman who wants to free his prehistoric homeworld from Gustaf's clutches. They must battle through several dinosaur-infested stages in their quest to end Gustaf's plans. 

Different weapons and health boosts can be found in the destructible wooden chests that litter the stages, enemies also drop coins when killed that can be collected for bonus points. 

Each of the two heroes also has a 'double-jump' move; players can jump, then jump again while still in the air. This allows them to reach previously inaccessible ledges and platforms as well as occasionally take different routes through a stage. In the single-player game, a wolfman will occasionally join with the player to aid in the fight. A large, powerful 'boss' dinosaur guards the end of each stage and must be defeated to progress.</desc>

		<name>E-Swat - Cyber Police</name>
		<desc>Cyber Police ESWAT is a 1989 scrolling shooter arcade game developed and published by Sega. Players take control of Duke Oda, a member of the Liberty City Cyber Police Force tasked with finding and arresting the city's most wanted criminals, and eventually dismantling a terrorist organization planning world domination.

The gameplay is very similar to Sega's own Shinobi, as the player has the ability to jump up and down between planes where possible. The goal of each of the game's 15 stages is to find and arrest a specific wanted criminal, who is usually fought at the end of the stage as a boss. Duke is initially armed with only a single-shot pistol, but upon arresting the first three criminals and being promoted to ESWAT, Duke is equipped with a Power Suit with a mounted machine gun for the rest of the game. The suit also has access to limited-use special weapons which can be found within stages. However, both of Duke's standard weapons require ammunition, without which the player can only attack with a kick. Additional ammunition can be found in boxes throughout each stage.</desc>

If Eggor shoots one of them, they will disappear for a few moments before rehatching. If one of the adult vultures shoots Eggor he will lose a life. Shooting an egg is worth 500 points on the first round and increases by 250 for every subsequent round, while shooting an adult vulture is worth 100 points upon the first round and increases by 100 for every subsequent round.</desc>

Having made it to the top of a 30 story building, Agent 17 has to make his way down to the basement to get to the getaway car and save the documents. Enemy spies are everywhere and the documents are hidden behind the red doors (bonus points awarded). He has to open the door and keep moving. If either of them shoots the lights out there will be a temporary blackout. If Otto finds himself on top of the elevator the player will not be able to control the elevator. If he gets caught in the elevator he is a sitting duck and cannot duck the bullets. By using the escalator he can reach the basement quicker. Otto can defeat his enemy by jump kicking or firing at them. Help Otto to grab all the documents and escape the spies.</desc>

		<name>Enduro Racer</name>
		<desc>Enduro Racer is an off-road racing game in which players ride a dirt bike across five extremely hilly and twisting courses. Each course is littered with logs, rocks, trees and rival racers that must be either jumped over or avoided.

Jumps can only be performed at specific locations on each track. These locations feature a dirt ramp that spreads across the width of the track. Players must have the bike in the 'wheelie' position when the ramp is struck, the bike will then be launched into the air. If the bike is not in a wheelie position when the ramps are struck, the bike will still clear the ramp, but will land front-wheel first and crash.

Enduro Racer is perhaps best remembered for its 'Wheelie' feature, which required the player to physically lift the cabinet's handlebars to raise the front wheel of the game's on-screen counterpart.</desc>

An unusual take on the overhead racing genre, Escape Kids has up to 4 players taking on the role of an athletic runner and competing to be the first to cross the finish line in a number of 3-lap races. As well as running, each player has a limited number of 'Super Jumps'; these allow the player to leap over both rival runners and obstacles.

Money is awarded for finishing first, and players can upgrade their runner depending on the amount of money they have available. Runners can be given extra super jumps, an upgrade to stop the runner from skidding when going through a bend in the track, quicker recovery time from falls, or be made stronger (and thus less likely to be knocked over by a rival runner). Special items occasionally appear and can be picked up and used. These range from an item that causes a small earthquake (causing all of the rival runners to tumble along the ground, thus slowing them down) and a bomb, which renders any runner that runs into it unable to move for several seconds.

Each race has a total of five competitors (either human or computer controlled) and players must finish in first place or are disqualified. Any player who wins all three races in a round will be taken to a bonus screen. Here, the player's on-screen counterpart rides a bike and the player must collect as much money as possible.</desc>

ESP Ra.De. received spiritual prequels in the form of the Espgaluda series; however, ESP Ra.De. is related to the Espgaluda series only by shared name and programmer Tsuneki Ikeda.

By 2018, Tokyo has reached its maximum extension, therefore falling prey of common problems such as overpopulation and criminality. For this reason, an artificial island, aptly named Tokyo-2, is created just offshore, thanks to the support of the shady "Yaksa" corporation, led by elusive billionaire Garra Ono, whose ties with the modern incarnation of Yakuza have not been proven. Another source of instability is given by the rising number of humans exhibiting extrasensory perception, the so-called ESPers, who are constantly hunted down by the Japanese Police Force. Unknown to everyone, Garra herself is an extremely powerful ESPer, bent on using her influence over the government and military to replace every living being in the city with clones (disturbingly enough, these ESPers take the form of a 10 years old girl, named "Alice" and implied to originate from Garra's own DNA). Just as her plans begin to unfold, three children are forced to take action, each one for his or her own personal motives.

The story takes place in December, during a 24-hour arc; each character has a specific stage which initiates his or her storyline, culminating with the final encounter.</desc>

In an otherwise peaceful world, the Shinra Empire began conquering nearby nations one by one to expand their territory gradually. Meanwhile, in the Shinra weapons lab, the Espgaluda project produced two successful prototypes: Agaha and Tateha. Fearing for their future, the project's head scientist, Hiodoshi, escaped with the two prototypes to a nearby kingdom, but time after were found by Shinra's troops and Hiodoshi was killed by the attack of the imperial army, the power of the galuda has awaken. 

You have the option of controlling one of two siblings each with different skills, Ageha  faster but with narrower shooting capabilities or Tateha slower but with a wider attack. As you fly through the various stages various mechanical enemies attack with a high number of bullets, often nearly filling the screen. Aside from the regular shots, Ageha and Tateha also have additional abilities which help the player navigate through the numerous bullets. The first is a guard barrier; when activated the player is immune to collisions and as a bonus when the barrier button is released a more powerful laser shot is fired. A meter at the bottom of the screen indicates how much power is left in the barrier. The second ability is called the Kakusei mode; when this mode is activated your character gender is altered and is able to fire a more powerful shot. More importantly, when this mode is activated all of the enemies and their bullets slow down considerably while the players speed remains the same making it easier to navigate through a tricky pattern of bullets. Activating Kakusei mode will rapidly deplete the players supply of green gems; since the number of gems isn't limitless the player may not be able to remain in Kakusei mode for long. When not in Kakusei mode additional gems can be collected by destroying the various enemies. If the player completely runs out of gems, enemy bullets begin travelling faster than usual. Another bonus in the game is gold inguts which greatly increase the players score. These are found when in Kakusei mode; when an enemy is destroyed, all of its bullets will turn into ingots which can be collected by the player.</desc>

If you win the game you move on to the next level, each time the opponent gets harder to beat. When you start playing you can choose one of 6 teams: Italy, England, Brazil, West Germany, Austria, or France. The sequel Exciting Soccer II was released in 1984 with Japan replacing Austria and new music, but identical gameplay. 

The game allows for one or two players to play and has a control scheme where they can tackle, shoot, short pass, and long pass. Exciting Soccer had realistic touches for the time: corner kicks, throw-ins, penalty shots, and cheerleaders, as well as digitized voices and an influential overhead view.</desc>

		<name>Exed Exes</name>
		<desc>Exed Exes is an arcade vertical shooter developed by Capcom. It was licensed to Memetron and released outside of Japan in the arcades as Savage Bees Memetron (licensor to the game). It uses similar hardware to Capcom's 1942, but it is more of a spiritual successor to Capcom's earlier shooter Vulgus. It takes place in a science fiction alien hive where you must pilot your ship through many stages protected by insects, some as large as your craft, and some even larger.

What made Exed Exes stand apart from other shooters, besides the high resolution graphics for its time, and the detailed use of parallax scrolling to indicate depth, was the fact that it was one of the earliest vertical shooters to allow for two player simultaneous play. Rather than waiting for one player to take his turn, two players could enjoy the game at the same time, and even work cooperatively to get further along in the game.</desc>

		<name>Exerion</name>
		<desc>Exerion is a vertical shooter that is operated with an 8 direction joystick and two fire buttons. The game's biggest features are the parallax scrolling which occurs in the background, and the sensation of inertia that is applied to the motion of the ship. The ship is equipped with two kinds of weapons. You can fire the dual shot gun which can only release one pair of shots on the screen at a time, but has an unlimited supply, by tapping the first fire button. The single shot gun can fire a rapid stream of shots on the screen at one time by holding the second fire button down, but it is limited in ammo according to the number of charges indicated on the bottom. Each weapon is best used in different situations, in order to defeat the enemies which come flying down from the top part of the screen.

Due to the inertia of the ship, you must input any reverse in direction much sooner in order to cancel the ships momentum. This was not a common feature for similar games that came out around the same time, so it distinguished Exerion from other shooters. Because the Famicom conversion was played on a horizontal screen, the enemies appeared much closer to the player's ship, which changes the feel of the game since you have to react to the enemies' location much sooner.</desc>

		<name>Express Raider</name>
		<desc>The wild west-themed Express Raider is separated into two different game types; a sideways scrolling fighting sequence and a shooting sequence. The player controls a train robber, or 'Express Raider', and must try to steal the bags of money from the moving locomotives.

During the fighting sequence, the Raider must fight the bank teller, hit the coyotes and then jump onto the train before it speeds away. Once on the train, he must fight his way past other enemies and avoid various projectiles, such as bottles, bullets and shovels full of coal. Players must be careful to duck under the low signs that come along as the train is travelling. Also, once a train carriage is clear of enemies, a bomb will appear between the current carriage and the next; players must quickly jump over to the next carriage before the bomb goes off, otherwise the Raider will fall from the train and a life is lost. If the Express Raider manages to reach the train engine, the loot will be captured and the game will then move on to the shooting sequence.

In the shooting sequence, the Express Raider rides a horse and must shoot at the enemies that appear from the windows of a train carriage. They will shoot back at the player and throw various objects. Players can hit the DUCK button to avoid the enemy attacks. A woman will appear at regular intervals offering the player a bag of money, if the player shoots the woman, a life is lost. After the shooting sequence has been completed, the game will start over again with an increased level of difficulty.</desc>

		<desc>A wholly abstract approach to the shoot-em-up genre in which one or two players take control of a disembodied, digitized human hand and must kill the swarms of insects that have infested a street of houses.

Exterminator is set in a street of houses and players must move from room to room in each property, clearing each one of the infestation, before moving onto the next house. Each player can initially only grab or 'thump' enemies (the latter for ground-based, crawling insects), but a number of power-ups, such as bug spray and somewhat bizarrely, a laser firing finger can be collected to make progress a little easier.</desc>

They compete with each other to reach the Castle of Darkness and defeat Erinyes, so one of them might be able to marry the rescued Electra and rule the land Exvania.

The players must take up control of four medieval lords who are fighting for control of the land. They have to battle through eight different castles, and try to gain control of each one. When one of the lords wins a battle, he shall receive a medal - and once he has won three medals, he will gain control of the current castle (which means that they can be up to six rooms long) and the game will proceed to the next castle. The gameplay is similar to that of Hudson Soft's Bomberman series, the initial title of which was adapted by Irem for the arcade in 1991. </desc>

		<name>F-1 Dream</name>
		<desc>You take the role of a newcomer race driver. Beginning in the Formula 3000, you will have to prove yourself worthy of being promoted to Formula 1 and challenge the best drivers of the late eighties.

F-1 Dream is not one of Capcom's best known games. From a top-down perspective and decorated with cute "deformed" graphics, it may offer a serious challenge. There are essentially two race instances: first you have to beat the clock in a single lap to qualify for a good position in the race, and second you have to beat your opponents. You also have to keep an eye on your car's condition, as the tyres and body wear out, so part of your strategy must consider pit stops.

Despite its looks, F-1 Dream is not a parody game. Released in 1988, it's in fact very respectful towards the sport, featuring little details which add realism to it. This includes several real brands advertised in the game, and others which have one or two letters changed in the logo, but are very easy to recognize. So it is with your opponents, featuring the great Ayrton Senna, Alain Prost or Nigel Mansell. The car behavior also features skids when speeding at corners, gears, and damage.</desc>

The heroes of the three first Tengai Makyou games must participate in a tournament and find out who is the most skillful fighter in the magical land of Jipang (which is very similar to the medieval Japan). The characters include well-known Far East of Eden heroes such as Ziria, Manjimaru, Kabuki, Orochimaru, and others - a total of eight playable characters. During the fights, you can either punch, kick, or use special attacks, that require a precise usage of buttons and also deplete your magic gauge. There are random items (such as healing potions) thrown on the battle field while you are fighting, which you can pick up.

Select either Joe, Andy or Terry, visit several locations in Southtown City and win that tournament!

Fatal Fury is a 2D fighter and is the first game in a series of one-on-one fighting games by SNK. It's a conversion of the original Fatal Fury arcade game. This first game does not yet feature the series' trademark pseudo 3D mode (which allows you to move between the foreground &amp; background while fighting). Includes a two-player vs. mode.

On Planet Fever, a small planet between Meruto and the Earth a base was planned to be installed, from there the attack vessels should start the invasion of Planet Earth. But before Admiral Gratze's plan was fullfilled, a mysterious wave appeared in space and confused the instruments of Meruto's fleet, and disrupted Admiral Gratze's love chat with his wife Irene Catharine. About this he got angry to such an extent that he forced his fleet to land on the source of this wave. So the wheel of fate began to spin...</desc>

		<desc>There are 8 characters to select from and two boss characters (the first boss character is only playable in two player mode). The object of the game is to win two matches out of three. Each character has a set of moves in addition to two basic punches and kicks. Each character also has a super move called a "Danger Move", which are similar to the Desperation Moves from Fatal Fury 2. Players also have the ability to taunt others, but unlike games such as Art of Fighting, this has no effect and would actually leave the player open to attacks.</desc>

		<name>Fighter's History</name>
		<desc>Fighter's History is the first attempt of Data East to enter in competition with Capcom and its omnipresent Street Fighter II. Because the many similarities shared by the game with the Capcom masterpiece (like the character select screen, the vs and winner/loser screens, the controls and the design and moves of some characters), Fighter's History was at least simply stamped by most of the  players like another SFII clone, and in this way remained ignored and obscured to the mass audience.

Although time after, the many beat'em up fans learnt to appreciate this maybe too underestimated fighting game, especially for its combo system, quite simple to execute even for those players not so able with timing and button pressing, and for its fast gameplay: at this purpose most of the contribution was made by the updated version released in 1994, Fighter's History Dynamite (known as Karnov's Revenge in USA and Europe) that made the gameplay more polished. Despite this at least Fighter's History never reached that great success that maybe Data East still tried to achieve.

Players choose one of 9 international fighters and battle to be the best in the world. Every character has his ending sequence and his own stage. There are also two not-selectable bosses to challenge for reach the end, and the last one of them is real surprising!</desc>

Before the game begins, the player chooses between the three main characters, Guy, Cody, and Haggar, each with his own fighting style and attributes. Guy is the weakest but has faster attacks, Haggar is the strongest but also the slowest, and Cody has all-round attributes.

Final Fight consists of six stages or "rounds", as well as two bonus rounds. Each round takes place in a different section of Metro City such as the Slums and the Subway, with most rounds featuring more than one level. At the end of each round the player will face a boss character unique to that round.</desc>

The player, as Charley Chuck, must dodge all kinds of flying fruit and vegetables and try to eat an ice cream cone before it melts. How many ice cream cones can he eat? Your players will soon find out in this incredible video feast. As an ice cream cone melts on the other side of the screen, Charley Chuck just naturally has to go for it, But he must get past Oscar, Angelo, Jacques and Zorba, four chefs who unexpectedly pop out of holes, chase Charley Chuck and throw food at him. They all have different personalities and they're all out to stop Charley Chuck if he isn't fast enough. There are piles of tomatoes, peas, bananas, pies and watermelon Charley Chuck can use to defend himself from the persistent chefs. The player controls Charley Chuck with an analog joystick which allows 360 degree movement on the playfield, and a Throw button, used when Charley Chuck needs to throw food at one of the chefs.</desc>

		<name>Frogger</name>
		<desc>Frogger is a one or two-player game in which players must overcome a number of hazards to safely guide the green amphibian from the bottom of the screen to one of five home bases situated at the top of the screen.

The lower half of the screen consists of a bi-directional flow of traffic moving across five lanes. To navigate across the road safely, Frogger's hops must be timed to avoid the vehicles, which include buses, civilian traffic and racing cars, with different vehicle types moving at different speeds. As well as being able to hop vertically, Frogger can also move left and right, allowing him to move with the flow of traffic. 

The upper half of the screen consists of a fast-flowing river populated with logs, crocodiles and turtles. Frogger will drown if he has any contact with the water and these act as platforms onto which Frogger can hop. He must be careful to avoid contact with crocodiles' snapping jaws, however and some of the turtles will periodically dive below the water's surface, drowning Frogger. Frogger will also die if he is on a log, turtle or crocodile when it reaches the edge of the screen.

On the logs of the river section a female frog will occasionally appear and bonus points are awarded if Frogger successfully escorts her safely home. A fly also appears randomly in a home base and bonus points are awarded if Frogger enters the base when the fly is present. Conversely, a crocodile may also appear in a home base and a life is lost if Frogger enters the base while the crocodile is present.

A round is completed once five frogs have been guided safely home, after which the next round begins with an increased level of difficulty. This includes faster-moving vehicles on the road section and new, deadly hazards on the river section, including crocodiles, otters and snakes.</desc>

The object of the game is to shoot a set number of enemy planes as they approach from front and behind; rolling and swerving to avoid incoming enemy fire. Certain stages feature ground-based enemy installations which must also be destroyed. The player's jet fighter is armed with both a machine gun, and a limited supply of missiles which can be 'locked-on' to enemy targets. G-Loc's levels take the player through a variety of different landscapes, including wide, rolling plains and rock-strewn canyons. Later in the game, the player must attempt to land their fighter onto an aircraft carrier. Failure to do so results in the game ending.</desc>

		<name>Gaia Crusaders</name>
		<desc>Gaia Crusaders is a one or two-player side-scrolling beat-em-up in which players must battle Satan and his army of demons that have captured and taken over the world. Players select a character from a choice of five combatants known as 'Elemental Warriors'. Each of the characters possesses either Wind strength, Fire strength, or a mix of the two. 

The game has the standard punch and kick attack moves as well as magical special moves. Combos can be strung together by switching quickly between kicking and punching. Players can also perform a 'super attack' by pressing the jump, punch and kick buttons simultaneously, this hits many enemies at once but costs the player character some health. It's also possible to raise a shield by pressing jump and kick simultaneously.

At regular intervals coloured spheres appear, players can pick these up to gain a magical attack. The effects of the magic attack differs depending on the player character. If the magic matches the character's elemental attribute (fire, wind or both), they will gain a special, screen-clearing attack. Otherwise, they earn a powerful special attack. 

In addition to the elemental spheres, there are two types of bombs that also appear, both of which detonate immediately once picked up. The first is an earthquake that hits all on-screen enemies and inflicts a large amount of damage. The second is a random bomb that sends out pillars of fire, hurting any enemies they come into contact with. There are also explosive boxes that can be kicked at enemies to keep them at bay. One last notable item is the sword, which functions much like weapons that can be found on the ground in many other beat 'em ups. A boss battle awaits players at the end of each stage.

Gaia Crusaders is heavily influenced by another scrolling beat-em-up, Capcom's 1989 classic, Final Fight and also, to a lesser degree, by Sega's Golden Axe (the latter being the use of the Magical Attack acting as a smart bomb).

		<name>Galmedes</name>
		<desc>Galmedes is a vertical scrolling shooter arcade game released only in Japan.. The ship has two types of attack: the standard firing weapon and a charge attack. Once the player collects all three weapons, the player can select any of those weapons during combat.

On the alien planet of Gaston, a dictator named Gildy rose to absolute power. Gildy started a plan to take over his home solar system, but upon doing so, he decided to spread his influence. After conquering his home galaxy, the next galaxy that Gildy planned on invading was the Galmedes Galaxy. In response, the unified forces of the planets of the Galmedes Galaxy have created a powerful space fighter known as the LEPTON (Launched Electro-Projectile Thermal Osmotic Nullifier). Two pilots, Foo and Bar, are selected to launch the LEPTON fighters against the invading Gastonian Forces.</desc>

		<desc>One month has passed since Musashi defeated his sworn enemy, Kojiro. Musashi was on the way to Kyoto, where his beloved Otsu was waiting for him. Around this time, many abductions had occurred by a mysterious group of ninjas, and Otsu was one of the missing. What is the true purpose of these ninjas? The time to fight has come again for Musashi!!

You must guide Musashi or his sister, Suzame, around several locations defeating a horde of ninjas with only a sword. Weapon power-ups and life bonuses can be collected along the way. You can jump high and use your grappling hook to attach to and climb some ceilings, as well as attaching yourself to faraway objects. At the end of each location, you must defeat a guardian in order to continue the game. Cut-scenes are viewed between locations.</desc>

		<name>Gauntlet</name>
		<desc>Gauntlet is a maze-based shoot-em-up for up to four players. Heavily influenced by classic fantasy conventions, players take on the role of either Thor the Warrior, Thyra the Valkyrie, Merlin the Wizard, or Questor the Elf and must play cooperatively as they explore and fight their way through the enemy-packed mazes. Competitive play is encouraged as players must fight for the limited amount of food, treasure, magic potions and power-up items that litter the dungeons. 

Each of Gauntlet's four characters have different strengths and weaknesses: Thyra has the strongest armour, Thor is best at hand-to-hand combat, Questor has the fastest speed and Merlin has the most powerful magic attacks. The object of the game is simply to survive as long as possible while exploring Gauntlet's mazes in search of treasure, food, magic potions and, ultimately, the exit that leads to the next dungeon. 

The potions - shown as blue bottles - that litter the levels offer either improved character abilities (such as 'speed' or 'extra shot power') or can be used as a 'smart bomb', destroying some or all of the on-screen monsters. Potions are also the only way to kill the game's 'Death' character that appears in many of the stages. Magic potions can be kept and used at the player's discretion by pressing 'Magic' button, although each potion can only be used once. 

The first seven mazes are always the same, but from level 8 onwards, players will find themselves on any one of over a hundred different mazes. If players survive for long enough, the mazes will be repeated in a different order. How long a player lasts depends upon the player's 'health' level. Health continually depletes as time progresses and further health is lost by contact with various monsters or their projectiles. Health can be replenished by consuming the food found in the mazes or by inserting more credits. The many treasure chests that litter the levels can be plundered for points, and collecting treasure increases a player's score multiplier when two or more players are playing the game.</desc>

		<name>Gauntlet II</name>
		<desc>Gauntlet II is a direct sequel to the legendary maze-based fantasy themed shoot-em-up, released a year earlier. Atari chose not to tinker with the core game-play mechanic to any great degree, opting instead to enhance the already excellent multi-player action that had created such a stir upon the original game's release.

As with its prequel, up to four players once again take on the role of either 'Thor the Warrior', 'Thyra the Valkyrie', 'Merlin the Wizard', or 'Questor the Elf' and must play cooperatively as they explore and fight their way through the enemy-packed mazes, collecting potions, food and treasure as they searched for the exit that would lead them to the next dungeon.

Changes to the sequel included the ability for players to play whatever character they wanted, even if that character was already in play. Characters were now colour-coded and players would find themselves taking on the role of 'Blue Elf', 'Green Wizard', etc. New in-game speech was added to allow for the new player definitions.

Other changes included the ability to 'bounce' shots off walls - known as 'Reflective Shots' - providing the correct potion was picked up. As well as new potions, Gauntlet II also featured several new monsters. The most notorious of the new additions was the Fire-breathing Dragon that guards the exit to some dungeons. This powerful creature takes multiple hits to kill and defeating it would see the players rewarded with a permanent potion and a bag of treasure.

Another notable addition was the 'It' monster: any player who was tagged by the creature would suddenly find that all of that level's monsters would ONLY chase the tagged player, completely ignoring the presence of all other players. The only way to remove this curse was to tag another player, thus making them 'it'.

New level elements were also added to further increase variety. These included dungeons with entirely invisible walls, magical walls (which changed into monsters or items when hit), stun tiles (which stunned any player that walked on them) and exits that flashed between functioning and non-functioning.</desc>

The character controlled by the player is that of a real Japanese samurai, Taira no Kagekiyo, who fell at the Battle of Dan-no-ura at the end of the Genpei War in 1185. Over eight hundred years later he is resurrected and has to make his way over the Imperial Regalia of Japan - fighting other characters who actually existed such as Minamoto no Yoshitsune and Saito Musashibo Benkei on his travels, as well as collecting the three sacred game items and defeating his arch-enemy Minamoto no Yoritomo.</desc>

The game was re-considered for release in 2001, but SNK's untimely demise later that same year may have ended that possibility. Data East was best known for its' Chain Reaction / Magical Drop series of puzzle games, and even later included the Ghostlop characters in one of the later releases for modern home game systems.</desc>

		<desc>Three years have passed since the events of "Makaimura" and Arthur the knight once again finds himself battling against the hideous creatures of Demon World. The demons have now seized the kingdom and Arthur returns home to witness the castle's lone survivor, his beloved Gunievere, murdered by the king of the demons, Lucifer. Arthur once again embarks on a one-man quest to destroy the demonic invaders and save Gunievere's mortal soul. 

Game-play is of a very similar vein to that of "Makaimura" - the classic run, jump and shoot action remains intact. Daimakaimura is, however, even more difficult than its already demanding predecessor. Arthur now has access to several new power-ups to aid him on his daunting quest, such as 'Golden Armour' which gives Arthur greater protection from the demons. Additionally, unlike "Makaimura", Arthur can now fire his weapons upwards instead of just left or right and, while jumping, can fire beneath him as well. 

The graphics in Daimakaimura are predictably far superior to those of its 1985 prequel, with highly imaginative level design and superbly-drawn, smoothly animated enemies all adding to the game's superb Gothic feel.

		<desc>Based on the Seoul Olympics, this is a multi-event track and field game for up to four players and featuring nine different events. Despite being heavily influenced by Konami's own "Track and Field" series, Gold Medalist lacks both the addictiveness and tight gameplay mechanics of the games upon which it is based. The nine disciplines, which can be attempted in any order, are:
100 Metre Sprint
Long Jump
Horizontal Bars
Freestyle Swimming
Boxing
Discus
110m Hurdles
High Jump
400m Relay</desc>

The game's three different playable characters are an Amazonian warrior named Tyris Flare, a Barbarian hero named Ax Battler, and a Viking dwarf named Gilius Thunderhead. Each character has a special attack move that is activated by pressing both JUMP and ATTACK at the same time. Also, double-tapping the joystick right or left will make the character charge and smash into opponents.</desc>

		<name>Gorf</name>
		<desc>The player's goal is to defeat the Gorfian Empire and safeguard the future of mankind. Gorf is a single screen shoot-em-up in the classic "Space Invaders" mould, the prime difference being that Gorf offers five distinct levels of shooting action. The levels are as follows: 

Mission 1 - Astro Battles: The first mission is more or less a straight clone of "Space Invaders", set against a sky-blue background. The player is protected by a glittering parabolic force field, which is gradually worn away by enemy projectiles. The force field also works in BOTH directions, and therefore must momentarily deactivate in order for the player's ship to fire out. To advance to the next mission, the player must destroy all the invaders. 
Mission 2 - Laser Attack: The other missions are all set in space. In this mission, the player is faced with two formations each made up of five enemies. The formations are cross-shaped, and at the bottom of each formation is a single laser gun. The laser guns fire a long, dangerous yellow beam at regular intervals. At the same time, the other enemies may break formation and attempt to dive-bomb the player. Destroying a laser gun causes the corresponding formation to break apart. To advance to the next mission, the player must destroy all the enemies. 
Mission 3 - Galaxians: This mission is a clone of "Galaxian". The player is faced with a swarm of galaxians, which continually dive-bomb and shower the player with deadly projectiles. To advance to the next mission, the player must destroy all the galaxians. 
Mission 4 - Space Warp: A wormhole is situated in the middle of the screen out of which enemies ships emerge, one at a time, and spiral outward at increasing speed; whilst growing larger and flinging fireballs at the player. The Space Warp level would have an influence on Konami's superb "Gyruss", released two years later. To advance to the next mission, the player must survive a number of these enemies. 
Mission 5, Flag Ship: The final mission is a one-on-one confrontation with the alien Flag Ship itself. The Flag Ship is one of the earliest examples of the 'boss' enemy in mainstream video games. It is equipped with its own force field, through which the player must blast in order to get a clean shot on the ship. It is also armed with a powerful fireball weapon. The player's weapon has a minor effect on the Flag Ship's hull, and can only blast off tiny pieces of it. This adds to the player's problems, as stray pieces of hull can destroy their ship. These pieces can be destroyed with a single shot. The only way to destroy the Flag Ship is to hit the glowing reactor at the heart of the ship, either by first blasting away the hull to expose it, or by managing to fire a shot directly into the tiny vent that leads to the reactor. 

Each time the Flag Ship is destroyed, the player advances in rank. Initially, the player begins with the rank of Space Cadet, before moving on to Space Captain, Space Colonel, Space General, Space Warrior, and finally Space Avenger. The player's spaceship is equipped with a Quark Laser which allows the player to cancel a poorly aimed shot and fire another shot.</desc>

		<desc>Gradius / Nemesis is a horizontally-scrolling shoot-em-up in which the player pilots a spacecraft known as the Vic Viper as they search through unexplored galaxies looking for a lost armada. These new galaxies are teaming with alien life set upon destroying the Viper. 

The game features a power-up system based on a selection meter at the bottom of the screen called a 'power meter', this allows players to 'buy' weapons and upgrades. To achieve this, players must destroy special individual enemies - usually red in colour - or enemy waves that then drop orange capsules. These capsules can be collected and used to upgrade the Viper's weapons. Each collected capsule advances the power meter by one step. Players can activate the highlighted item at any point, after which the power meter resets.</desc>

		<desc>In the darkest reaches of infinite space, pure evil lies in wait ... The Dark Forces led by the god of destruction, Bacterian, prepare to launch a massive onslaught against the planet Gradius. Possessing unstoppable power, the Dark Forces threaten to plunge the Universe into total war and complete annihilation.

Their invasion force smashes the Gradius defenses, and the surrounding planets soon fall like dominoes. Now Bacterian's evil grasp reaches for the heart of the resistance...planet Gradius itself...

To counter the oncoming threat the United Gradius World Forces gather all their fighter craft. Half of them form a defensive net - the other half a strike team. But they are badly outnumbered and The Dark Forces easily tear through their thin frontline. No fighters survive the slaughter....

In a last gasp move, the United Gradius World Forces send out two fighters, previously considered too dangerous for combat missions: The InterDimensional VIC VIPER fighters.

The Fighters take off for the heart of darkness to join the fray that will decide the fate of the Universe...</desc>

Ajoutez à cela les habituelles "bombes-en-quantité-limitée-qui-nettoient-l'écran", les bonus power-up 3 tirs, laser, tir élargi, et vous obtenez un shoot de plus, assez joli graphiquement, mais réellement ennuyeux.

		<name>Gravitar</name>
		<desc>Gravitar is a 1- or 2-player game with a color X-Y video display. This new display, with its three color guns and higher voltage, has the same technology that was used in previous Atari black-and-white X-Y displays. However, the screen now displays dazzling colors and unique visual effects. 

The player controls a space ship in three different solar systems. Each solar system consists of a home base, a death star, a red alien planet and four regular planets. Each planet has its own unique terrain. 

The red alien planet is the home of shooting alien ships. Some of the regular planets may have flying alien rammers to be avoided or shot down. The four planets all have fuel cells to be retrieved with a tractor beam and alien bunkers that fire shells. Successfully destroying all of the bunkers results in a 'MISSION COMPLETE' message at the top of the screen. Achieving 'MISSION COMPLETE' allows the player to collect bonus if he can evade the rammers when leaving the planet. If successful, he will be placed back in the solar system. 

A player has two ways to advance to the next solar system. The first is to successfully complete a mission on all four regular planets. The second way is to complete a mission on the red alien planet, which establishes a link into the next solar system.

		<desc>It is August 1999. In the skies over the Middle East, the second Persian Gulf War has begun. The early half of the 90's, the Persian Gulf War breaks out in the Middle East and prolonged fighting rapidly increases the rate of destruction of the world's natural resources. In 1999 this develops into a state of crisis where the effects of the war have resulted in an absolute shortage of reserves. Mistaken policies have resulted in the nation of the Middle East, suffering from shortages since the time of the original Persian Gulf War, taking military action against neighboring nations in an attempt to assure a supply of resources for themselves. Those nations which have managed to escape the fighting once again form a Multinational Force. Using the technology gained from research which had been done for a new type of nuclear reactor, they succeed in developing and producing GRID - a Gyrodrive Reactive Intercept Device. This is the start of Project Storm Hammer.</desc>

		<name>Guerrilla War</name>
		<desc>The country is struggling under the cruel domination of its evil King. The rebel guerilla leader and his comrades attempt to secretly land on shore. The King's military is waiting for them, however, and the players must fight their way inland to reach and destroy the King's palace stronghold.

In this, the pseudo-sequel to SNK's own superb "Ikari Warriors" (released two years earlier), players must once again shoot their way through a number of vertically scrolling levels, all packed with large numbers of enemy soldiers, gun emplacements and vehicles. Each level also contains a number of captured prisoners tied to wooden stakes, and these can be rescued for extra points. 

The players' weapons have only a limited amount of ammunition and additional ammo/grenades must be picked up along the way. A number of gun upgrades can also be found. At various points in the game, players can also enter unoccupied enemy tanks, which provide increased firepower as well as resistance to enemy shots. Too many enemy hits, however, will eventually see the tank explode - this is proceeded by a warning flash to allow the player to exit the tank before the explosion occurs. Should the player be caught inside or near the tank when it explodes, a life is lost.

As with "Ikari Warriors", Guerrilla War features full 360 degree gameplay with attacking troops appearing from all directions. The players' on-screen counterparts are able to rotate themselves accordingly.</desc>

Also licensed to Media Shoji for distribution.

Initially, the game subject wasn't 'Gulf War' but after the Gulf War breaks out, game's subject was changed to the Gulf War.

This game was sold very well, and it was exported very well. Dooyong took the 'export prize' and set up sisterhood relationship with U.S.A. and Japan Company.</desc>

Gulf War-II is more like a bootleg or hack than an original game; a LOT of the game code is taken directly from Taito's "Twin Cobra". The gameplay is nearly identical but the theme and all the GFX have been changed.

Like many game from Korea, Comad used the Gulf war theme in the 90's. This was a great theme, because based on the actuality, and the game sold very well (hundred thousand of boards)

		<name>Gun &amp; Frontier</name>
		<desc>The year is 2120: Earthlings have spread beyond their galaxy and have started to colonize uninhabited planets in different solar systems. One such planet to be colonized was the Earth-like planet Gloria which happened to have an enormous natural supply of gold. This discovery became pivotal to Gloria's emigration, so much that emigrators would be impoverished by the cost of reaching the planet. Because of this, life on the planet thrived in a setting similar to the American Old West. Though poor, the gold trade aided the Glorian's in advancing technology and knowledge, so much that among the inhabitants lived talented inventors and engineers.

However, the Glorian's were not the only ones who were tempted by the planet's gold: Space pirates known as the Wild Lizards quickly invade Gloria and decimate the towns of the people and enslave those who survived in an attempt to deplete the planet's gold supply. Two inventors of Gloria who were a part of the planet's development teams decide to strike back at their invaders using two fighter jets in the shape of giant revolvers with plane wings.

As far as vertical scrolling shooters go, Gun Frontier is very standard. Players start with dual machine guns which are strengthened and multiplied by upgrades that come in the shape of US dimes taken from buffalo shaped enemies and every five dimes empowers the ship's guns. Players also start with a bomb supply which is upgraded to further destruction by collecting gold bars from destroyed ground forces. Once a player accumulates 25 bombs, they are granted access to the Bomber Max, the strongest of the player's bombs.

The players can also pick up spinning coins with two different sides: a silver side and a gold side. If the player collects the coin on the silver side, then the player merely gains another coin for their guns. However, if the player collects the coin on the gold side, then the player's guns and bomb supply is maximized to full power.

A unique feature to the player's bombs is that the direction of the bomb's blast can be determined by the player's movement. If the player moves their plane to the lower right of the screen and launches their bombs, then the direction the bomb will travel in the opposite direction the plane's movement. This feature can only be used however when a player has a large bomb count as only having one or two bombs will result in a small directionless explosion. Like most bombs in shoot 'em ups, the bombs also work as a shield against enemy fire.

The game uses a check-point system in which a downed single player will start off at the beginning of the check-point they died at.

Gun Frontier also employs an anti-autofire mechanism where the difficulty will max out by the second stage if the player is sustaining too fast of a fire rate.</desc>

		<desc>Gun.Smoke is a vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up set in the Wild West, in which the player takes the role of a Billy; a young Sheriff charged with hunting down and killing a number of infamous 'Wanted' outlaws.

Each level is packed with gun-toting bandits and the Sheriff must shoot his way through the stage, before finally taking on the wanted outlaw 'boss' character at the end. Each outlaw wields a special weapon unique to them, such as a Winchester rifle, knives, darts or boomerangs.

Shooting the barrels that litter the levels reveals power-ups such as boots (for extra speed), rifles (for increased range) and bullets (for rapid fire). The game's 3 directional fire buttons (for firing left, right or ahead) can be combined (pressed Simultaneously) to create a total of 8 different firing directions.</desc>

		<name>Gunbird</name>
		<desc>Gunbird is a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up developed and published by Psikyo and released in Japanese arcades in 1994. It has been re-released multiple times, including on the Sega Saturn, PlayStation, and Steam. When originally localized outside Japan by XS Games, Gunbird was retitled Mobile Light Force. The game was followed by Gunbird 2 in 1998 and was included in Gunbird Special Edition.

When a player collides with the body of an enemy unit, the player loses a shot power level, and a power up flies around the screen and disappears as soon as it reaches the edge. If a player is at the lowest level of shot, the player loses a bomb instead.
There are seven stages in each of the game's two loops. The first four stages are randomly chosen from possible five. In the second loop enemies fire denser bullet patterns moving at faster speeds. Stage 2-1 takes place at the only stage not available on the first loop, instead of the 1-1 counterpart. The remaining three stages are chosen at random, but does not include the replaced stage. After completing first loop with only one player, the player can choose one of two choices for a wish with a magic potion, with unique endings for each choice. If the first loop is completed with two players, a combination-specific ending is played.
The cutscenes between the battles with two players fighting cooperatively are frequently packed with hilarious dialogue and situations. This is often a recurring theme with Psikyo games, the Gunbird games being no exception. There are no cutscenes when playing second loop stages. The Korean arcade version contains English dialog but some sound samples are missing during play.

Gunbird uses manga-styled character as the player's chosen craft. A story plays out in between levels and before boss fights, telling a tale of how the protagonists are trying to collect pieces of a magic mirror to make a wish.
Ash: A 28-year-old German man with a jet pack on his back, who in some of the scenes between battles is discovered to be an inventor, and when two players choose Marion and Ash as cooperative partners, he takes an unhealthy interest in her. Voiced by Ry?tar? Okiayu.
Marion: A 13-year-old witch from England who flies on a broomstick. She is accompanied by her talking pet rabbit, Pom-Pom, and frequently abuses the poor creature verbally and physically. Marion is fun-loving and thrill-seeking but also selfish, and has a mean streak (which Pom-Pom is often witness to). Voiced by Chiharu Tanaka.
Valnus: A big robot created in Russia six months ago that has some of the best firepower in the game. Secretly wishes to be human. Voiced by Kazuya Tatekabe.
Yuan Nang: A strong-willed and courageous woman whose character design is highly influenced by that of Sun Wukong from the Chinese classical story Journey to the West, including a cloud-somersault parody, Ruyi Jingu Bang, and the size-changing headband that was used by the monk Xuánzàng. Voiced by Naoko Matsui.
Tetsu: A strong, white-haired old man of 60 years. He is homosexual in a rather uncloseted manner and rides in a man-powered helicopter. Voiced by Sakunosuke Maya.
The Trump: A group of sky pirates consist of Ace (voiced by J?ji Yanami), Claude (voiced by Kazuya Tatekabe), and their female leader Rouge (voiced by Noriko Ohara). They are not playable and serve as the players' rivals in the story.</desc>

If one possessed by a shikigami can gather talismans of the five Chinese elements?wood, fire, earth, metal, water?from five demons serving Guwange, then infiltrate Gokumon and slay Guwange, the shikigami will be destroyed and the one possessed will not suffer a premature death.</desc>

		<desc>Gyruss is a single-player shoot-em-up in which the purpose is to fly through the solar system, destroying waves of alien attackers, before finally reaching Earth. Planets that must be passed before Earth is reached are Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars. 

It only takes two warps to reach Neptune, but all of the others, including Earth, take three warps to get to. Each time the player reaches a planet, they will be faced with a 'Chance Stage', a bonus stage in which players try to destroy as many aliens as possible to accrue points. After reaching Earth, there is a Chance Stage, followed by a very fast '3 Warps to Neptune' stage. After this, the levels and the background music start over. 

Gyruss' superb gameplay, in which the player ship rotates around the edges of the screen and fires 'inwards', is heavily influenced by Atari's 1981 classic, "Tempest". While the design of the alien ships themselves is similar to those of Namco's also-legendary "Galaga" series.</desc>

		<name>Hard Head</name>
		<desc>Players control the character Hard Head, who can use a bubble gun to entrap enemies, then jump on their heads to defeat them. Often compared to Nintendo's Super Mario Bros., the game met with some favorable reviews on release and its offbeat sense of humor has been noted. Enemies include monsters and ducks. Hard Head can use his head to break bricks, some of which contain power-ups. Levels are completed by finding a soccer ball and kicking it through a goal to finish the stage. There are 16 levels in total. A two-player simultaneous mode is also available, allowing another player to control the second Hard Head twin.

SunA subsequently released a sequel to the game, Hard Head 2, which featured the same characters but different gameplay.</desc>

		<name>Heavy Barrel</name>
		<desc>Heavy Barrel is a 1987 overhead run and gun arcade game by Data East.

Terrorists have seized the underground control complex of a nuclear missile site, and it is up to the player to infiltrate the base and kill the enemy leader. Players begin armed with a laser gun with unlimited ammunition and a limited supply of grenades. Improved weapons and grenade powerups are made available within the game, either in plain sight or within crates that must be unlocked using keys. Additionally, crates may contain orbs or one of the six pieces of the Heavy Barrel superweapon. Like SNK's Ikari Warriors, the original arcade version featured 8-way rotary joysticks.
The name of the game is from an in-game weapon. The Heavy Barrel is found in six pieces and is an energy cannon capable of destroying any enemy in the game with a single shot (except the final enemy, and possibly one other boss that may have required two shots). The weapon has a wide arc of fire and can be fired as fast as the player's trigger finger permits, but after thirty seconds its use is exhausted, at which point the bearer reverts to his previous weaponry. Best used to get past tough bosses, the weapon could be built several times in a single game (probably three or four times). In a two-player game, whoever collects the sixth piece is equipped with the Heavy Barrel.</desc>

		<name>Hopper Robo</name>
		<desc>Hopper Robo is a platform game in which the player must use a two-way joystick to take up control of a robot named Hopper Robo, and a single button to make him jump. His objective is to collect the numbered boxes on each round in numerical order (the one he should collect next will flash), then drop them onto one of the two conveyor belts at the bottom of the screen. There are several kinds of enemy robots that guard some of the boxes; they all move in preset patterns and you will have to learn their movements in order to figure out the best moment to sneak past them. If any of them touch Hopper Robo he will die. He must also avoid other obstacles such as flying hammers and springs. To aid Hopper Robo, there are springboards to reach higher platforms, and pipes to slide back down. If Hopper Robo should run out of energy, it will cost him a life - but when he clears a round, his remaining energy will be awarded to the player, as bonus points. There are eight unique levels, after which the game loops indefinitely.</desc>

		<desc>Hot Dog Storm plays like any typical vertical scrolling shoot 'em up from the early-to-mid 90's. The player takes the role of the pilot of a futuristic space fighter, waging war against a horde of giant robots, tanks, mechs, and massive gunships. Similar to games like Strikers 1945 or Raiden, enemies often attack with extremely fast volleys of projectiles, in contrast to proto-bullet hell games such as DonPachi that started appearing the previous year.
The game has five stages, each ending in a boss fight. Bosses have destructible parts that can be blown apart piece by piece for more points, and each boss also has a telegraphed super weapon that fires periodically and must be avoided. 
The game never explains its unusual title.</desc>

		<name>Hydra</name>
		<desc>An abstract racing game in which the player takes on the role of a special government courier, who must deliver a number of secret cargoes to their various destinations at the end of each stage. Gameplay consists of piloting a heavily-armed hovercraft over a series of waterways, avoiding or destroying the enemy craft and barriers that litter each level. Progress is hampered by mines, enemy hovercraft, logs and other obstacles. Money bags can be collected as well as extra fuel.

On-board fuel depletes at a steady pace and players must keep a look out for additional fuel cells. In addition to a forward-firing gun, the hovercraft is equipped with a 'Boost' function. Providing the player has enough boost fuel, the craft can be made to fly in the air for a limited time; useful for avoiding enemies and barriers, as well as for gaining access to certain bonus items.</desc>

		<desc>Rabid-Media rates this game: 4/5This one's just plain rediculous! you are some fat guy in a suit. there is a small screen filled with other suited guys, a rolling barrel, and bars of gold. your job is to get those bars of gold and bring them to the building with the word, "IN" on it. Kinda like flicky, you can bring some over to it, then get the rest seperately, but you will get less points this way.
the graphics are nice and vivid (for an 80's sega arcade game.) and the animations are just plain silly, and sometimes disturbing (when you get caught by a suited man, he then is in a black bikini beating you with a whip!)
you can combat these perverst by punching them, sometimes repeatedly. you must jump over the barrel to avoid it most of the time.
as far as arcade games go, it's definately a fun, challenging product of Japanese insanity! try it!</desc>

		<name>I, Robot</name>
		<desc>I, Robot is a 3-D shoot-em-up in which the player controls the "Unhappy Interface Robot #1984"; a servant robot who has become self-aware and decided to rebel against the all-controlling Big Brother and his ever-watchful 'Evil Eyes'.

The game is set over a series of platform-based stages constructed from solid coloured blocks and to complete a stage, players must "eliminate the red zones". This is achieved by moving the robot over all of a stage's red surfaces, changing their colour to blue. The colour scheme - including target colour - changes every 26 levels, however. So while the target colour is red for the first 26 screens, it becomes yellow from Level 27, blue from Level 53 and magenta from Level 79.

In order to reach all of the platforms and surfaces, the Interface robot will need to jump. This must be carefully timed, however, as jumping is not allowed under Big Brother's strict regime and his Evil eye - sitting atop a pyramid at the back of the playfield - will open at regular intervals to watch over the interface robot. Should the eye be fully open - indicated by it turning red - when the robot is mid-jump, he will be spotted and destroyed, costing the player a life.

Once all of the coloured squares on a stage have been eliminated, the enemy's shield is destroyed and the Interface Robot will need to be guided to a final, previously inaccessible coloured square at the back of the playfield. The Evil Eye is then zapped and destroyed.

Some levels feature different background elements that affect gameplay, such as walls that must be shot and destroyed to reach coloured tiles, or indestructible moving columns that intermittently block access to coloured tiles, making timing difficult. There are also enemies to be shot or avoided, including birds, bombs and flying sharks.

		<name>Ikari Warriors</name>
		<desc>Ikari Warriors is a vertically-scrolling run 'n' gun shoot-em-up in which one or two players take on the roles of two bandana-wearing musclebound soldiers as they engage in jungle warfare, fighting over land and water to reach the village of Ikari.

Players can rotate their guns through 360 degrees, allowing them to fire and move in all directions. Standing between the soldiers and their destination is a multitude of enemy soldiers, tanks, helicopters and reinforced bunkers. 

The enemy soldiers utilise a number of different weapons, including machine-guns, grenades, super grenades and flame-throwers. The game's standard enemy troops wear blue uniforms, but there are also enemies in red uniforms that when killed, often drop power-ups that either give players more ammunition, increase the power of bullets and grenades or even kill all enemies on the screen. The players' munitions are limited in number so additional ammo and grenades must to be picked up along the way. 

While most of the action takes place on foot, unoccupied enemy tanks can be found that can be entered and driven. Tanks offer increased firepower as well as resistance to enemy shots. Too many enemy hits, however, will eventually see the tank explode, this is proceeded by a warning flash to allow the player to exit the tank before the explosion. Should the player be caught inside when the tank explodes, a life is lost. Tanks also have a limited amount of fuel but extra fuel can be found to replenish it.

Another obstacle that players need to be wary of, whether on foot or in a tank, are hidden land-mines. These cannot initially be seen put will appear and flash as the player approaches. These cannot be destroyed and contact with them results in an instant death.

Unlike most arcade games, Ikari Warriors is not separated into different stages; the game takes place over one huge, scrolling stage. Ikari Warriors does have a continue feature, but it's only possible to continue from where the last game ended by first holding down the FIRE button, then pressing the start button. Simply pressing the start button restarts the game from the very beginning.</desc>

		<desc>Image Fight is a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up with an original premise. The game's first five stages are supposed to be a 'simulation' and serve as training to test the player's abilities. Player's will receive a penalty if their hit-ratio is too low.

Once players have proved themselves on the opening stages, they will progress to the game's last three stages, blasting off into space on a mission to destroy the alien vegetation surrounding the Moon's main computer. If the player fails in the mission, they must endure the dreaded 'Penalty Zone'. Features a high level of challenge, a wide variety of weapons and the ability to change speed.

If the player's ship is equipped with one or more red/blue extra guns, pushing both Action buttons simultaneously will sling the guns forward in a boomerang-like fashion. This is a powerful and destructive method and can be done an unlimited number of times.</desc>

		<desc>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is an action games based on the movie of the same same in which the player takes on the role of action hero, Indiana Jones. Indy must infiltrate the lair of the evil Thuggee cult and their boss, Mola Ram, armed only with his trademark whip. The goal is to free the children the cult has kidnapped as slaves, recover the stolen relics known as "Sankara Stones" and escape from the temple.

The game that takes place over three different zones; the mines, a mine-cart chase and the temple. Players can choose to start the game on any one of three difficulty levels: easy, medium and hard. These are selected by entering the corresponding door.

The first zone is made up of ledges, ladders, slides and conveyor belts. Indy must free kidnapped children by finding their cages and whipping them open. Rattlesnakes and Thuggee guards patrol the ledges and must be avoided or whipped. Players must be careful to not fall from a ledge or a life is lost. Mola Ram himself occasionally appears and throws flaming hearts at Indy, these must be whipped or avoided.
The second zone is a recreation of the famous mine cart chase from the movie and the player must guide Indy's cart to the bottom of the mine, keeping ahead of enemy carts and avoiding dead ends and track-side enemies. The cart can be steered left and right to different tracks to avoid obstacles.
The third zone takes place in the temple itself and Indy must make his way to the altar and retrieve the Sankara stone. Indy must avoid guards, rattlesnakes and flaming hearts thrown by Mola Ram. Once a Sankara stone has been retrieved Indy must escape the temple through one of the four doors that opens.

The zones are then repeated twice more to collect the two remaining stones, although the lay-out and difficulty of the zones is different. Once all three Sankara stones have been collected, Indy must work his way through a final mine and mine-cart section, before making his escape on a rope bridge and facing Mola Ram for the final time.

Intrepid is a game in which the player must use a 4-way joystick to take up control of a secret agent Intrepid whose objective is to enter an embassy, find and retrieve a secret plan, then escape as fast as he can. There are eight items that Spy 001 must find by looking around the rooms these doors lead to which are all worth 300 points when collected: a key (which unlocks the locked door on the fourth floor), a combination (which is needed to open the locked safe), an ID card (which allows Spy 001 to bypass the embassy's security systems without electrocution), a disguise (this allows Spy 001 to bypass the sentry, without getting recognized), an umbrella (which allows Spy 001 to jump off the embassy roof without falling to his death), a wrench (which is to sabotage the elevator, and trap the guards at the bottom of its shaft), a map (which shows the locations of the remaining items) and a pair of running shoes (which allow Spy 001 to move faster). 

If Spy 001 should fall down the elevator shaft, get caught by the guards, or get recognized by the sentry at the safe, he'll lose a life. If he should jump off the roof before he's opened the safe (but after he's sabotaged the elevator), it is physically impossible for him to reenter the embassy. Should this happen, the bonus timer shall immediately decrease to 0 and cost him a life. Once Spy 001 accomplishes his mission, he'll proceed to his next mission which has more guards.</desc>

		<name>Iron clad</name>
		<desc>Ironclad is a side scrolling shooter developed by Saurus in 1996. Ironclad was first shown in its native MVS cartridge format at the March 1996 ACME show in Orlando, Florida. I saw and played the game at the show. We always knew therefore that at the very least, one proto was available on the MVS format. Although the game saw release on the NEOGEO CD system, it was never officially released in either the MVS or HOME cartridge formats. Ironclad was the most sought after of all the CD-protos because of its appeal to shoot 'em up fans. This was most likely why it had coincidentally caused the largest number of false claims; more then any other proto cartridge! 13 years later, in November of 2009, SNK finally released the native ROM data for the game and as a result we finally got the game and can now enjoy it forever!</desc>

		<desc>Iron Horse is a horizontally-scrolling platform run 'n' gun game set in the Wild West in which the player takes on the role of a train-robber. The cowboy can use either his fists, pistols or a whip and must work his way along a moving train, killing enemy cowboys and collecting money bags.

The action takes place either inside a moving train or on its rooftop, with ladders allowing players to move between the two. Player and enemy movement is on three planes and players can duck to both avoid enemy fire and shoot crouching enemies.

The weapon option the player chooses at the start of the games significantly alters the way it plays, with weapons arranged by ease of use. The three weapons and their qualities are:

The whip has good range and can knock out several enemies at once, making it the ideal beginner's pick. 
The pistol fires bullets that have longer reach and is the only weapon that can be used while still running, but each bullet can kill only a single enemy.
Fists have the shortest range but can lay out several enemies in one punch with a domino effect. Double points are awarded for each hit.

In addition to the main weapons, sub-weapons can be collected by killing special, box-carrying enemies. Lanterns create a wave of fire which burns enemies to cinders, bombs destroy everything within a ten-foot radius and lassos tie up enemy varmints.</desc>

		<name>Ironman Ivan Stewart's Super Off-Road</name>
		<desc>In his never ending quest for adventure and excitement, man invented off-road racing. These races were then brought before the masses by converting huge sports stadiums into dirt and mud obstacle courses in which off-road 'Ironmen' battled for top honors. 

Now the Leland Corporation brings this fast moving, hard driving sport to the video game arena. 

Ironman Ivan Stewart's Super Off-Road is stadium off-road racing at it's best. One to three players are asked to test their dirt track skills against the best dirt truck driver in the world. 

Contestants compete on eight different tracks with a total of 16 configurations and these courses are packed with enough jumps, bumps, hills, and holes to challenge even the most skillful driver. 

Winning drivers earn 'cash' prizes, and use this 'cash' to 'buff out' their machines. At the end of each race, players take their trucks to the 'Speed Shop' to buy better shocks, tires, engines, and higher top speed. They can also buy nitro packs to help them blast over the jumps and through the mud. 

The 'Convert-a-Credit' feature allows drivers to add to their winnings by using credits as 'cash'. Each additional quarter, when converted, becomes $200,000 in game 'cash' and this additional 'cash' may be used for purchases in the 'Speed Shop'.</desc>

		<name>J. J. Squawkers</name>
		<desc>J.J. Squarkers is a scrolling run 'n' gun platform shoot-em-up for one or two players in which several residents from the peaceful village if Pistachio have been kidnapped. Most of the remaining villagers have fallen under a mysterious spell, making them violent. Players take on the roles of two ducks called 'Ani Karasukun' and 'Ototo Karasukun' who set out to defeat the enemy minions and restore peace to their village. 

The ducks can fire projectiles to defeat the abstract enemies they face, with their default weapon being tomatoes. Other weapons - as well as bonus and health power-ups - become available when certain enemies are killed. Available weapons include pumpkins, watermelon seeds, screws and slinkys wearing red sneakers. 

Each weapon has different strengths and weaknesses; for example the slinkys simply walk in a straight line until they either meet obstacles or the edge of screen, making it easy to deal with enemies from a distance. On the other hand, watermelon seeds can only be thrown a short distance but several are thrown at once. This effectively gives players a 'spread shot' and is more effective when multiple enemies are attacking from several directions at once.

J.J. Squarkers consists of five stages with a powerful end-of-level guardian waiting at the end of each.</desc>

		<name>Jack the Giantkiller</name>
		<desc>This game plays a lot like "Donkey Kong" except that the controls are not quite as smooth. There are 5 screens to master if you want to help Jack in his mission. You do not get to play each screen at first, they are added on as you progress through the game. The first time through the game skips from screen 1 right to screen 4.
The 1st screen is fairly simple, you just have to climb to the top of the beanstalk. There are a few enemies, but they can be defeated by simply tossing beans at them. You can find the beans scattered all around the stalk, and picking one up adds one to your ammunition count (or two, depending on the dip switch settings).
In the 2nd screen, Jack manuevers through the clouds and attempts to cross the drawbridge into the castle, but lions and birds stand in his way.
The 3rd screen has Jack climbing the castle stairway in a scene that was obviously inspired by "Donkey Kong". Avoid the cat and the mouse and you can make it to the top.
On the 4th screen you have to jump from platform to platform until you reach the giant's lair. There will be several treasures, grab the flashing one and try to make your escape.
The 5th screen is the first one again, except that this time you are climbing down the beanstalk, and you have falling rocks to dodge, and the giant himself may even be after you (that one depends on the level).

After making it back to your house you get to watch a little intermission before going after the next treasure. There are four different treasures altogether. The last one is the princess, when you have her the giant himself will follow you down the beanstalk, and you must chop it down to defeat him. After rescuing the princess the game starts over with increased difficulty.</desc>

		<desc>A mass prison breakout has occurred and the prison warden has been kidnapped in this sideways scrolling shoot-em-up from Konami. The player controls a lonely police officer whose job it is to kill the hordes of escaped convicts and, eventually, rescue the kidnapped warden. Each level also has a number of civilian hostages that also roam the levels and need to be rescued.

The player begins the game with only a pistol, but 2 extra weapons, in the form of a bazooka and a tear gas gun, can be collected. The 'Weapon Select' button cycles through the player's weapons via a display at the bottom of the screen. When the desired weapon is highlighted, pressing the Fire button will select and fire the desired weapon.

Hostages will randomly run across the screen and can be rescued by running into them. Should the player accidentally shoot a hostage, all extra weapons will be lost leaving only the pistol.</desc>

		<desc>The game combines Capcom's trademark anime-inspired graphics, as seen in the Darkstalkers series, with the colorful characters and events of Hirohiko Araki's creation, resulting in a highly stylized and detailed visual style. It also features many of the gameplay mechanics seen on previous Capcom fighting games, such as the use of power gauges for super moves, as well as a brand new Stand Mode. In the game's storyline (based on Stardust Crusaders, the third story arc of the manga), a Stand is a manifestation of the psyche, or a spirit, that accompanies each character and can be summoned or dismissed at will by the player, resulting in variations on the character's move list and abilities. Despite their power, Stands hold one drawback; any damage received by the Stand is transmitted to its user.

Hirohiko Araki served as a consultant for the game and created exclusive pieces of artwork for its promotion and packaging; most notably, he developed from scratch a new character design for Midler, since Capcom was interested in using her in the game and she had been only vaguely shown in the original manga.</desc>

ON THE SCREEN: The game is made up of groups of 5 sequences for each rack. When play begins, all the performers run onto the screen and jump aboard their transport ship, the Scarab. The Scarab then lifts off and heads for a point in space that is at the center of a grouping of five planets. (The song that is played in the background during this scene is 'Lights'.) Each group member's instrument is on a different planet.

At the beginning of each sequence, when a 2-PLAYER game has been selected, the game tells which player is up.

		<name>Joust</name>
		<desc>Joust is a platform-based action combat game for one or two-players (with the two-player game offering either team-up OR head-to-head combat; the first time arcade gamers were given this choice) in which each player controls a knight riding on the back of a flying ostrich. 

The object of the game is to progress through platform-based levels by defeating groups of buzzard-riding enemy knights. This is achieved by 'jousting'; both enemy and player knights carry a lance and must fly around the level (actioned by repeatedly hitting the 'Flap' button) trying to oust rival knights from their steeds by ramming them with the lance. This can only be achieved if the attacking rider is above the enemy knight when the lance connects. A collision of equal elevations results in the two knights bouncing off each other, but if a player is lower than their enemy at the instant of contact, they themselves will be knocked from their steed and lose a life. 

A defeated enemy will turn into an egg that falls to the bottom of the screen. This must be quickly collected by players as if the egg lands on a platform and isn't retrieved in time, it will eventually hatch into another enemy knight that must be defeated again. 

Joust features three different types of enemy knights - Bounder, Hunter, and Shadow Lord - with each earning players different points values when defeated. A pterodactyl will appear after a predetermined time to hunt the players. 

Accurately navigating the player Knights can be initially quite difficult as control is strongly affected by both gravity and inertia. Players can lose a life by either being knocked from their steed by an enemy knight, or by falling into the lava pit at the bottom of each level.</desc>

On the planet of the floating cliffs, society calls upon its wing-mounted Gladiators to solve conflicts. You, the Gladiator, must enter the fray, participating in a challenge of honor, a Joust... where only the fittest survive! 

The legend of "Joust" continues in Joust 2. Players must solve the puzzle of what strategy will be most effective in dealing with the buzzards and other winged enemies on each of Joust 2's 35 different backgrounds. 

The object of Joust 2 is to defeat all winged enemies by colliding with them. To survive a collision (joust), the Gladiator's lance must be higher.

		<name>Joyful Road</name>
		<desc>A weird driving game with a car that has long arms that reach out to grab a variety of edible items that appear along roadside.

The object is to drive safely down the road. Pick up enough fuel to stay alive while avoiding other vehicles that go by, grab as many bonus objects as possible including apples, cherries, bananas, acorns, live fish and money, and park your car in the garage. Driving while trying to pick up the goodies is difficult and you can crash very easily on the narrow roads. The pace of the game is frustrating because the hands move slowly while the car itself moves really fast, especially in the later rounds. If one of your hands hits a tree or any other foreign object in its quest for food, the car winces in pain for a few moments until it can use its hands again.

You can get a bonus for putting used-up food into garbage cans. Grabbing fish which leap out of surrounding rivers is a safe bet, but most other bonuses are placed, so you can crash if you try to grab them. The best strategy is only to go for the fuel, since the car is a big gas guzzler and you can also get a bonus for leftover fuel at the end of the drive.</desc>

		<name>Jr. Pac-Man</name>
		<desc>One of many sequels to the legendary "Pac-Man", Jr. Pac-Man features the character of Pac-Man's son. For the first time in the series' history, side-scrolling mazes were introduced, with each maze being two screens wide. 

This time, the mazes have no exit tunnels through which players can make an escape. The bonus items that appear move around the maze and are now something of a mixed blessing, as not only will they destroy any Power Pills they come across, but they will also turn any normal dots they pass over into large dots that slow the player's movements considerably, but are worth more points than normal dots if eaten by the player. Any mutated dots in the maze will disappear if the player loses a life. 

The Pac character is once again pursued by four ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Tim) in his quest to eat all of the dots in each maze. And, as before, numerous Power Pills litter the mazes that, when eaten, allow Jr. to eat the pursuing ghosts. 

As with previous "Pac-Man" games, intermissions are featured between certain levels. Jr. Pac-Man's intermissions are episodic in nature, like those found in "Ms. Pac-Man". Jr. Pac-Man's story tells of the blossoming love between Jr. Pac-Man and a small ghost named Yum-Yum.

Jungle King has four stages, each with its own unique scenarios, so each stage could be considered a separate game in its own right. </desc>

		<name>Juno First</name>
		<desc>Juno First a vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up viewed from a third-person perspective in which players must destroy waves of attacking aliens. Unlike other shooters of the time, the game's enemies don't line up in a gallery formation but instead move freely around the screen. Because of this, the player's ship can move both forwards and backwards (in addition to left and right).

As well as the attacking aliens a spherical 'space capsule' occasionally appears on-screen and if shot, it releases an enemy astronaut that can then be captured. This must be done within a set time, however, with the screen having  a red tint for the period in which rescue is possible. During the capture phase, every enemy the player shoots is worth an additional 200 points. 

As a last resort players also have the option to 'warp' to another random part of the play area. This is highly risky as it may place the player's ship in a position more dangerous than the one it left. Players are allowed three warps per level.

Starting formations vary from stage to stage and the aliens mutate into more dangerous forms the longer they survive. To complete a level all aliens must be destroyed.</desc>

Jurassic Park features Sega's often-used and highly effective sprite scaled graphics and is very similar in style to another Sega Lightgun shoot-em-up, 1991's "Rail Chase". For subsequent games in the series, graphics technology had moved on somewhat and scaled sprites were dropped in favour of far superior textured polygons.</desc>

		<name>Kaiser Knuckle</name>
		<desc>Kaiser Knuckle follows the same fighting game conventions established by Street Fighter II. The player's character fights against his or her opponent in best two-out-of-three matches in a single player tournament mode with the computer or against another human player. The player has a character roster of nine fighters to choose from, and three bosses, each with their own unique fighting style and special techniques. The control layout is set to the six-button standard (a la most Capcom fighting games), but it can be switched to a five-button layout via dip settings. One unique feature is that Kaiser Knuckle was the first and only fighting game that has five strengths of basic attacks.  Another unique feature is that it introduced the power zones, which can be utilized via a successful hit of a special move when a player's "Crush Meter" is full. The power zones (either fire or electric) can affect the certain special move a character has. Backgrounds can be destructible when players get hit to charge up, and when those meters are full, the next special move that a player connects with his/her opponent will destroy the background's properties at will (other parts of stages, such as floors and walls are also destructible).</desc>

		<name>Kamikaze</name>
		<desc>Kamikaze is a simple 2-D shooter. You control your laser base against an endless stream of alien invaders. The invaders don't come in set waves. Instead, they come in a constant stream. Once you have gotten through one barrage of aliens, more are just behind to continue the action. Your job is to keep them from overwhelming you with their superiority in numbers. Kill or be killed, that is the objective.

Kamikaze is one of the follow-up games that rode on the wave of the "Space Invaders" craze. The game itself is simple in concept but the action gets fast paced real quickly. Especially since several things can be going on at the same time during the game.</desc>

		<name>Kangaroo</name>
		<desc>A platform game in which the player controls a mother Kangaroo who must climb through the treetops trying to rescue her captured son. Numerous monkeys, the kidnappers of her child, roam the levels set on stopping the player's progress. The monkeys constantly throw apples at the Kangaroo which must either be avoided (either by ducking or jumping, depending on the height of the approaching apple), or punched away, the latter of which allows the Kangaroo to punch the apple back towards the attacking monkey.

If the player stalls for too long or does not punch either an apple or a monkey, a giant ape will appear and steal the Kangaroo's boxing gloves, leaving the player temporarily defenseless. The gloves are returned after a short time.

Fruit and vegetables litter the levels and can be picked up for bonus points. Each level also has a bell hanging from one of its platforms, which can be punched to make fruit and vegetable items appear. The game consists of 4 different stages, once these are completed the game begins again with an increased level of difficulty.</desc>

In addition to kicking and punching, each character also has their own unique 'special attack'; a move that injures multiple on-screen enemies at the cost of some of the player's health.

While in no way original (drawing most of its inspiration from Capcom's "Final Fight"), Karate Blazers is both hugely playable and very fast and frenetic, with the amount of on-screen enemies at times overwhelming. The graphics are also well drawn and nicely animated.</desc>

Get all the pieces of the map and you get to the treasure. Your journey won't be easy though. You will be going through some rough environment such as towns, forests, oceans, and caves. To further make your travels a hazard, different enemies attempt to end Karnov's life prematurely and prevent him from getting to the treasure. To aid Karnov in his adventures, he has certain items that he can draw from his inventory. In addition, there are other items that can make Karnov a potent foe of those wishing to harm him. You must complete each scene in order to advance to the next scene. All in a days work of a hearty explorer.</desc>

The continuous industrialization that started in 1900, finally led to unavoidable consequences in the middle of the 21st century. The waterlevel rose worldwide and threatened many coastal countries. So the shorelines had to be modified In order to save the human civilisation from drowning. It was a time of great confusion about the future, and nobody thought about war. Well, almost ... There was one company called EVAC corporation, who made a great profit from underhand productions and exports of weapon systems. When the United Nations discovered their illegal trades, they pointed EVAC to the global ban of weapon imports and exports, and asked them to stop their productions and to destroy their weapon facilities immediately. EVAC rejected all accusations and refused to take any actions. So a preventive war was started by the United Nations to stop the EVAC corporation.</desc>

		<desc>10 genetically engineered fighters engage in 1-on-1 combat in a tournament arranged by the sinister 'Ultratech', the organization behind the genetic creation of the fighters. The tournament soon turns into a battle for survival.    Each player starts the game with 2 energy bars, which represent the amount of health each player has for the entire game. Once the first bar is depleted, the player falls, gets up and starts to use the second energy bar. A voice will subsequently announce either 'Round Two' or 'Killer Instinct!'. The player who wins the first round gets to keep their remaining energy, and still has the second bar to use in future fights. This gives an advantage to the player who wins the first round.    Killer Instinct introduced incredibly complex combos to the fighting genre, as well as including the Fatalities and Humiliations made famous by Midway's "Mortal Kombat" Series.</desc>

Eyedol's death at the hands of Orchid accidentally sets off a time warp, transporting some of the combatants back in time and allowing the Demon Lord Gargos to escape from Limbo.    Now, trapped 2000 years in the past, the warriors that survived Killer Instinct, along with several new faces, fight for the right to face Gargos in combat. Each character that survived the journey from the first game has a corresponding background story, while new characters on this installment are native inhabitants of this past time period. Some fighters, like T.J. Combo who survives from the original, just want to get home. Others, like new character Tusk, want to bring an end to Gargos and his reign of evil. This time there is no tournament or prize money, just a fight to the finish with the fate of the future hanging in the balance.</desc>

You must protect the King and prevent him from being captured and carried away by one of the balloons.

		<desc>The object of King of the Monsters 2 is similar to its predecessor. Choose from three monsters which include a large lizard, a large robotic ape, and a huge mutant human. Then walk through each city, making sure to destroy everything in site, including planes, buildings, and other creatures. When smashed, some buildings reveal power-ups that make your character more powerful. At the end of each city, you go head-to-head with the boss creature. There are small stages in between where you fight a second monster for bonus points, or you fall from the sky and land underwater where you try to collect points and power-ups while falling.

		<name>Klax</name>
		<desc>The tiles klank end over end down the ramp. Catch them on the paddle, or they fall in the pit. Flip them from the paddle into the bins, matching the same-colored tiles horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Each line of colored tiles is a Klax. When you've made a Klax, you hear a fanfare. When you complete a wave, the crowd cheers. Let a tile fall in the pit, and you hear a scream as it falls in. If you fail to complete a wave, the crowd is disappointed. Stay alive, complete the waves and don't drop any tiles!

Catch the tiles as they come to the end of the ramp on the paddle. Flip a tile into a bin by pressing the start/flip button. Pull the joystick forward to increase the speed of the closest tile as it klanks down the ramp. Push the joystick back and toss the top tile on the paddle back on the ramp and gain a little time.

The paddle can hold up to five tiles. As long as the green light is on below the paddle, you can pile more tiles on the paddle. When the red light appears, you must flip at least one tile in a bin or toss it back on the ramp before you can collect any more tiles. You can flip tiles into a bin as long as the green light is on below the bin.

To succeed in Klax, make points and also complete each wave. Create a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row of at least three tiles (just like in tic-tac-toe) in the bins to make a Klax and make points. You receive the most points for diagonals, less for horizontals and the least for verticals. When you create a Klax, the tiles in the Klax disappear to make room for more tiles in the bins.

		<desc>The game takes place in modern times where a great depression has swept over the world. Amidst the depression and its riots of jobless workers, a mad scientist starts his plan of world domination. Taking command in the titular fortress orbiting Earth, the evil Doctor Gegeben Funkerun uses his own robots, flying fortresses and mercenaries to wreak havoc across the globe until all his demands are met. Assisting the attacked and weakened governments, workers across the nations help develop a series of jet fighters called the Aizerun Geist to use against the forces of Dr. Funkerun and save the world.

Before each stage begins, players are given a choice of weapons to purchase at a hangar for the Aizerun Geist. There are four weapons within three tiers to choose from including Main Attack, Sub Weapon and Bomb. Of the Main Attack the player can choose Twin Shot, Laser, Heavy Laser and the Charge Shot. Of the Sub Weapons, players can choose additional firepower, Homing Missiles, Shielded Options or an energy barrier. Players can stock up on multiple bombs including Small bombs, rockets, larger bombs or napalm.

The Aizerun Geist provides tactical advantages during combat with the use of its manually directional Sub Weapon. Players are able to direct additional firepower in five directions including vertical and horizontal by pressing the bomb button while firing. The game runs for six stages through various settings such as a jungle, stormy skies, Tokyo and Fortress Strahl itself.</desc>

		<name>Krull</name>
		<desc>The left joystick controls the movement of the player character, Colwyn. He can be moved in any one of eight directions. The right joystick controls the movement of the player's weapon, the glaive. It can be thrown in any one of eight directions. Four glaives can be in flight at one time and will return to Colwyn with a boomerang-type action. The one and two player select buttons are also located on the panel.

Krull consists of five subgames:
The Mountain Game.
The Swamp Game.
The Fortress Game.
The Hexagon Game.
The Beast Game.

The player must accomplish a task in each of the five games with eight levels of difficulty in each. All eight levels can be reached in one task based on the time spent performing that task (amount of time spent on that subgame). The total number of lethal characters on the screen at one time increases as the levels increase.

FROM THE SKY WILL COME THE BLACK FORTRESS. FROM THE FORTRESS WILL COME THE SLAYERS, TO DEVOUR THE PLANET OF KRULL. THEN SHALL A GIRL OF ANCIENT NAME BECOME QUEEN, AND THE KING SHE CHOOSES SHALL RULE THE PLANET.

The planet Krull is threatened by the Beast. His army of Slayers has brought terror to the land. Colwyn must stop this terror and save the land and its people. On the day Colwyn is to wed the Princess Lyssa, the Slayers, army of the Beast, kidnap her to become the Beast's bride. Colwyn must reach the Black Fortress and reclaim his Princess. He who marries the Princess shall be king. The Beast must not be allowed to rule the planet.

A prophet acquaints Colwyn with the magical properties of the glaive, a five-bladed sword, which Colwyn must acquire. To accomplish this task, he must climb the mountain and collect the five individual blades of the glaive in order to assemble the weapon. The blade is picked up by touching Colwyn to the blade. Boulders are fatal and must be avoided. The weapon joystick is not utilized in this subgame. The player is awarded 1,000 points for each blade picked up. Points are also awarded for placing Colwyn in a dangerous position in front of one or more boulders.

During his travels to discover the Black Fortress, Colwyn comes upon an army of eight men that he befriends and recruits to help him in his quest to destroy the Beast so that Krull can be safe from his evil.

With no intentions of losing his newly acquired bride without bloodshed, the Beast orders an army of Slayers to stop Colwyn and his friends. Forging through the quicksand-riddled swamps, Slayers materialize from the soil and Colwyn prepares for battle. In the second subgame, Colwyn must save as many friends as possible while killing all of the Slayers. The friends are saved by touching them and the Slayers are destroyed by the glaive. The Slayers themselves and their spears must be avoided. The game begins with eight friends. The number of friends saved is the number of friends carried over into future subgames. The friends can eliminate the Slayers with hand-to-hand combat but can also be destroyed themselves. Receiving three blows either by hand-to-hand or by the Slayers spear is fatal to the friends. The subgame ends when there are no longer any friends to save and all of the Slayers have been eliminated. Avoid quicksand, as it slows Colwyn's attack. Each friend saved awards 1,000 points (maximum 8,000 points) and 100 points for each Slayer the player eliminates.

After days of travel, Colwyn and his men have found the Black Fortress in the Iron Desert where many dangers await them. While attempting to lead his men through the dangerous narrow passageways that lead to the Fortress, Slayers materialize once again in a second attempt to stop Colwyn's struggle. In this third subgame, Colwyn must pick up all of his friends and deposit them safely into the hexagon while again combating the Slayers. The total number of friends in this subgame is equal to the total number of friends saved in Subgame 2. This subgame concludes when all of the friends have been delivered to the hexagon. The player is awarded 1,000 points for each friend delivered to the hexagon, 100 points for each Slayer he destroys and 100 points for each Slayer remaining when the last friend is delivered to the hexagon.

Victorious in battle, Colwyn must now attempt to release his friends from the hexagon. Unlike entry, exiting the hexagon is a struggle deservant of its own merit. Once again Colwyn must call upon the power of the glaive. Release of his friends is accomplished by throwing the glaive at the front wall while it is black only. Any glaive striking the wall while it is not black will stick in the wall until the wall becomes black. The Slayers, of course, attempt to stop Colwyn's efforts. In his own attempt for survival, Colwyn must fight them off and avoid their spears. The subgame ends when the last black wall is broken through and the friends have escaped. The player is awarded 100 points for each Slayer he puts an end to, 100 points for each Slayer remaining when the friends are set free and 1,000 points for the first black wall destroyed, 2,000 points for the second, 3,000 points for the third and 4,000 points for the fourth.

Now inside the Black Fortress, Colwyn secedes from his friends in order to rescue the Princess Lyssa. He finds her in a large cave carefully guarded by the Beast. He knows that the only way to reclaim his bride and conserve the planet is to forge into battle with the Beast. In the fifth subgame, the player moves Colwyn towards the Princess in order to reach her. As he progresses, the Beast attempts to stop him by throwing fireballs at him. The fireballs must be avoided or destroyed by the glaive. If not destroyed, the fireballs will ricochet off of the walls. Destroying a fireball awards the player 100 points multiplied by the number of fireballs in flight. The Beast is momentarily stunned when hit with a glaive and awards the player 100 points. The Beast cannot be destroyed and the player must avoid touching him. When Colwyn reaches the Princess, his friends, following the pandemonium of the battle, appear and chase the Beast off, awarding 1000 points per friend. The total number of friends in this subgame is equal to the total number of friends saved in Subgame 2.</desc>

The game puts you in control of a team of 3 characters (with you controlling the lead character or the one with the ball at the time) that must defeat a selection of other teams in order to become the champion. This time around the teams are all formed by characters from the Nekketsu Kunio Kun universe, each representing different suburbs of Tokyo that compete in an amusement park for the ultimate title. Each character has their unique stats and special moves, which now depend on a power bar that can be charged-up by holding both attack buttons.</desc>

		<desc>With your super kung-fu skills, penetrate the enemy's headquarters to rescue the Chris family.

At the end of the 20th century, the world has gone through vast changes. Country borders around the world are constantly changing and every day brings further territorial expansion and new threats of power struggles. 

A member of the World Secret Police Organization (WSPO) has obtained information about an upcoming coup, but before it could be turned over to the WSPO he and his daughter were captured. Before his capture he was able to send a detailed letter to his counterpart in the People's Republic of China, code-named Kuri Kinton, along with a plea for help. 

It's all up to Kuri Kinton now to save the captives and restore the delicate balance of power.</desc>

As well as the sublime graphics and superb playability, Virtua Racing also allowed players to switch camera views to suit their preferred style of play.

		<desc>Last Duel - Inter Planet War 2012 take place in the year 2012 in an alternate galaxy, Last Duel involves the struggle between two planets Mu and Bacula. On planet Bacula, a strong warrior tribe known as the Galden rose to immense military power and conquered all of the societies on the planet. Unsatisfied with conquering just one planet, the Galden decided to conquer a neighboring terrestrial planet, Mu. Using advanced bioships, star fighters, and motor vehicles, the Galden invaded Mu, destroying many of its cities and taking the planet's ruler Queen Sheeta hostage. The remaining royal guards of Mu are deployed in space fighters that can transform into cars to rescue the queen and crush the Galden forces.

The player alternates each level between using car and space ship. The vehicle has two main attacks one of which varies depending on the form the vehicle took. In car mode, the vehicle can jump over pot holes and enemies. While in ship mode, the vehicle can perform a barrel roll, making it temporarily invincible.

The player can select Power-Ups that including a large, slow firing laser, a twin-shot, a wide shot and options that provided side attacks. Speed-Ups were only available in ship mode. Every driving section is timed and if the player is unable to reach the boss on time, they will lose a life. However, the moment the player encounters the boss, the timer will be removed.</desc>

Each player has a separate screen that shows, roughly, a fist person view of the maze. You can move right/left, up/down along the corridors and also rotate. You also have a weapon, a kind of gun that you can get upgraded if you stop at the shop  in the maze and have earned enough money by creaming the resident enemies on that level.

Lethal Crash Race ne comportant pas de licences officielles, vous monterez donc dans une Pherrari, Masda, Honta ...
Techniquement c'est en vue de dessus, comme Top Rally ou les premiers GTA. Toutefois il n'y a pas de zoom. Tout ça scrolle bien et plutot vite, la jouabilité ne pose pas de problèmes particulier, et les musiques techno-cyber collent bien à l'ambiance.
Sans etre un jeu incontournable, Lethal Crash Race permet de se divertir, au moins le temps de la découverte.

After charging up enough power, you can press the bomb button for a smart bomb attack which uses up the whole power gauge. With more power it creates a bigger explosion. 

Power-ups switch your weapon to fire different projectiles, like lasers that spread out at right angles, and a flamethrower that reaches farther with more power.</desc>

		<desc>At first glance, the gameplay resembles Taito's Qix. The player controls two "arrows", one red (Libble) and one blue (Rabble) with a line strung between them. The object is to wrap the line around poles and surround Mushlins and enemies with it. The player can either close the loops themselves (worth more points for the Mushlins) or move both arrows to the same edge of the screen. The player clears a "season" when he or she harvests all the Mushlins.</desc>

		<name>Liberator</name>
		<desc>The Liberator controls consist of a trackball, fire button, and shield button. The player controls a coordinated attack from four star ships at the corners of the screen. The primary target of the attack are enemy bases on a rotating planet in the center of the screen. The trackball is used to move a cross-shaped cursor. The fire button fires a missile at the cursor's location from your closest ship. The shield button is used to activate force fields around the ships. The shield can only take four hits each round, and the count is shared between all ships.

At the beginning of each level, the player is flying through outer space and spaceships fly on screen from the left and right and leave in an arc. They try to ram into your ships. Note that shields do not work during this stage.

After this stage, the player is taken to a view of a rotating planet. The most prominent enemies are red flashing missile bases. They shoot missiles, fireballs, and star balls at your ships. The enemy bases can also detach from the planet, turn into satellites, and orbit the planet while shooting missiles. Once all missile bases are destroyed, the player moves onto the next level. At higher levels, there is the white master base. It is very intelligent, and it can change the direction or speed of the planet rotation to avoid getting hit.</desc>

		<desc>In Lightning Fighters and Trigon, the original Japanese version, there are different rules depending on whether you start the game with one or two players. In a one-player game, you start with no bombs, and when you die the game restarts you at a checkpoint. In a two-player game, each life starts with one bomb, and when you die you respawn in place. There are some powerups that only appear in a two-player game and one that only appears in a one-player game. The game type cannot be changed once the game starts. A second player cannot join an originally one-player game; conversely, if one player dies in a two-player game the game remains in two-player mode and the second player can rejoin at any time.

In Lightning Fighters, even if you start a one-player game, the game is always in two-player mode: you respawn in place when you die and you start each life with one bomb stocked. This means that a second player can join midway into a one-player game. Unfortunately it also means that the powerup that only appears in one-player games in the other versions, does not appear at all in the US version.</desc>

The game is a maze game. Like "Pac-Man", you're trying to eat up dots while four cops (with the names Spiffy, Smarty, Scaredy and Silly) try to stop you. While you don't have energizers to eat the cops with, you CAN block them off with walls (or better yet, try to trap them in the corners). When you're finished eating dots, there are two exits for you to escape from the cops.</desc>

		<name>Lost Tomb</name>
		<desc>A shoot-em-up set in an ancient, South American pyramid, in which the player must explore a large number of single rooms in the search for treasure. Each room is filled with enemy creatures that must be killed or avoided. The player is equipped with a limited amount of whips and must collect as many items of treasure as possible.

The player is presented with options throughout the game, depending upon which rooms they wish to enter. Once a path is chosen, players must pick up treasures, kill all the monsters in their way, find the key and exit the room as fast as they can; avoiding the potential of setting off an earthquake. Upon exiting a level, the player is presented with a hallway which shows a number of doorways allowing access to any one of several different rooms. This allows players to pick their own route through the game, but the decision which room to tackle next must be taken quickly as players must reach their chosen room quickly or risk being attacked by a flock of screeching birds.

The player's character is armed with an eight-way firing gun (in a similar fashion to Williams' 1982 classic, "Robotron"). In addition to the gun, the player is also equipped with three whips, which can be used to either kill attacking creatures or to knock down any walls that bar the player's progress. Players are given the opportunity to purchase additional whips at the interludes between levels; this is done by inserting an extra credit into the arcade machine and pressing the relevant button.

Treasure must be constantly collected in order to stay alive.</desc>

		<name>Lunar Lander</name>
		<desc>Lunar Lander is a 1-player coin-op electronic game that simulates landing a manned spaceship on the moon. Various video-display phrases indicate score, time elapsed during this landing mission, fuel units consumed, altitude above the moon, and horizontal and vertical speed. The fuel consumption and both speed readings are important for the player to determine how to land the craft. Realistic engine rumble and crash sounds accompany game play. A high beep warns of an almost-depleted fuel supply, whereupon players can add coins to automatically extend the game and 'fill up' their fuel tanks. Depending on the quality of the landing or the crash, various messages are displayed on the screen.

Game play begins with engine rumble and the lander drifting towards the bottom
right corner of the screen. Horizontal and vertical speeds are constantly displayed, including two arrows to show horizontal and vertical directions of travel. Altitude is measured in distance above the surface of the mountain - not above 'sea level'. The screen also shows time in actual seconds, representing time elapsed in the current mission.

The operator can select from four different settings for fuel units - 450, 600, 750 or 900 fuel units per coin (free play is also available). As the lander module flies over the landscape, it approaches the mountains and a landing site. At a certain point near the mountains, the game 'zooms in' for a close-up view of everything on the screen.

If the player realizes the speed is too fast and the landing looks hopeless, he or she can press the ABORT button on the control panel. This will give the lander extra thrust and make it fly upwards at top speed. The abort feature does consume 120 to 180 fuel units, though, as a disincentive to overusing it. If the ABORT button is pressed too late, however, a crash cannot be avoided.

The four levels of mission difficulty are determined by the player and can be changed at any time during the game or the ready-to-play mode. The differences between the four are printed on the mission select panels and are self explanatory, except perhaps rotational momentum. This feature causes the lander to tumble around when either ROTATE button is pushed. The longer either button is held down, the faster the lander module will spin in that direction. The player gains control of the lander by pressing the other ROTATE button for the same amount of time.</desc>

		<desc>Lunar Rescue is a combination 2-D simple flight simulator and 2-Dimensional shooter. You start the game by floating within your mother ship. You then either must release your lander or after a pre-determined period of time, the mother ship will forcibly eject it. You first have to navigate through six rows of asteroids to make it to one of the landing platforms. You have six platforms initially but each landing will eliminate one since there is one platform per astronaut you have to rescue. On your return trip up, the screen changes and now you have saucers trying to destroy you with laser fire. Again, you will either have three or six rows of saucers depending if there are meteors in the area. You then must successfully land in the docking bay of the mother ship to get credit for a successful rescue of one astronaut.</desc>

M.I.A. Missing in Action is a horizontally-scrolling run 'n' gun platform game for one or two players in which Special Forces soldiers must penetrate enemy-packed combat zones to reach a POW compound and rescue captured prisoners. The rescued POWs must then be escorted safely through a final enemy-packed stage to the helicopter that awaits at the end. 

Players begin each stage armed with only a combat knife to protect them, but other weapons can be picked up from fallen enemy troops. The weapons are always carried by soldiers in red uniforms and range from an assault rifle, grenades, a flame-thrower and a bazooka. Players can carry more than one weapon and can cycle through them as needed. Each collected weapon has only a limited supply of shots.

The game's first four stages are presented in random order and may also be "mirrored", switching the action from from right-to-left instead of left-to-right, increasing the game's variety and adding replay value. The 'POW' and 'Helicopter' stages are always the last two stages, however. 

At the end of each stage players must fight off a wave of enemy troops as well as destroy gun emplacements and watch towers. Certain sections of each stage offer players a different route, with both platforms and underground tunnels that can be utilized and explored. At least one POW must be safely escorted to the rescue Chopper to complete the final mission, after which the game starts over with an increased level of difficulty.

The game consists of six stages:
War-torn battlefield
Airstrip
Jungle
Rail Yard
POW Base
Escort the POWs to the Helicopter

M.I.A. Missing in Action is the direct sequel to 1985's "Green Beret" but unlike its prequel, two-player games now have both players fighting side-by-side, rather than the alternating approach of the original game.</desc>

		<desc>By 2011, the only way to travel at top speed is on skyways build high above the ground. These become popular with boy-racers and general speed freaks pretty soon, and that's why you're aiming to hurtle across them in this arcade conversion.

The road scrolls vertically, with some moderately sharp bends in a manner similar to Spy Hunter You have a jump device to clear the many jumps, or to land onto and flatten the other maniacs who line the road. You must choose which path to follow at OutRun-style forks in the road. 

The roads contain bonus tags including bonus points, a battering ram to make contact with other cars more effective, and energy boosts to replenish damage. If you leave the road you must replace your car onto it using a directable winch which appears at the appropriate point.</desc>

		<desc>Mag Max is a horizontally scrolling shoot-em-up in which a single player takes control of the 'Maxcraft' hover-ship and must battle their way through an packed enemy installation to find and destroy the invading alien 'Dragonia' fleet.

The action takes place both above and below ground and transporters appear throughout the game that allows the Maxcraft warp between the two as players search for the three-headed 'Dragonship'.

At various points the player will come across robot components - either a torso, a pair of legs or a plasma gun - and collecting these will eventually see the player's hover-ship become a towering robot, vastly increasing its firepower in the process.

If the Maxcraft takes an enemy hit when additional components are attached, a component is lost. If the ship is hit when only in basic form, however, a life is lost.</desc>

You can hold multiple balloons of the same colour at once and cause consecutive collisions. There are special balloons that cannot be removed that easily and power-ups that clear entire rows or provide additional help.

Depending of the originating country, there are different game modes:

1. Survival: Play as long as you can - an endless flow of balloons appears at a rapidly increasing speed while you move up levels.

2. Puzzle: You have a limited time to clear a fixed set of balloons before time runs out.

3. VS Mode: Fight the CPU or a fellow player in a direct split-screen duel. Each character has specific item balloons during gameplay.</desc>

In the game you control a clown who throws marbles up on the screen into the cluster of multi-colored marbles, rocks and crystals. The goal is to get three or more of the same color to remove marbles, but you can also grab more than one at the time to create long chain combos and gain better "special" blocks at the top of the screen.

You can play the game in single player modes or versus a friend in versus mode. In versus mode you get to pick your character, much like in a fighting game, each with their own counter attacks and abilities.

For the PSX version, the first Magical Drop was included on a separate disc.</desc>

		<name>Major Havoc</name>
		<desc>Major Havoc is a vector-based shoot-em-up and platform game in which the evil Vaxxian Empire overran the galaxy many years ago. Most of humanity was enslaved and abducted to the Vaxxian home world, although a few human scientists managed to escape. The Vaxxian Empire has long since collapsed but numerous Vaxxian space stations, all blindly controlled and defended by robots, still remain in the galaxy, mindlessly following their original, pre-programmed orders.

The small band of scientists who initially escaped have cloned the great human hero, 'Major Havoc' and tasked him with flying his 'Catastrofighter' through a wormhole in space so that he may lead a clone army against the dreaded Vaxxian robots and to liberate the remnants of humanity by destroying the enemy reactors. The player controls Major Rex Havoc, the leader of this band of clones.

The game is broken down into two distinct gameplay genres. The first is a shoot-'em-up in which the player controls Major Havoc's spaceship against the numerous robot ships that defend the enemy reactors. The ships are encased in a force-field shield which must first be shot and depleted before the ship itself can be destroyed. 

The second section is a platform/maze game in which the player - after first landing on the space-station by centering their ship between a moving white line - enters the station. The object here is to reach the core of the station and sabotage its reactor by setting an explosive charge. Once the charge has been set, the player must quickly escape back to their ship and and reach a minimum safe distance before the space-station explodes. 

The Space-station has reduced gravity, making Major Havoc react slowly to players' input. Each station has a maze-like layout and red arrows guide the player towards the station's core. Once the charge has been placed, more arrows guide the player to the station's exit. The mazes of successive space-stations become more complex and harder to navigate as the player progresses. Players also have a limited amount of oxygen in a station but more can be collected by running over the 'O2' symbols scattered throughout the maze.

Major Havoc features a warp system that allows players to skip levels and gain bonus points or extra lives. The warps are activated by a utilizing a Breakout-style mini-game at the bottom-right corner of the screen. 

The mini-game is available at the start of each wave and the way it works is this: a two or three-digit number is displayed and players must move the controller until the number matches the one required to warp. For example, the RED WARP requires the number '23', so the player must move the controller left or right until the first digit matches '2', then must press the fire button. The Breakout game begins and must be played while moving the joystick to the '3'. Once players have successfully entered the warp code, they are transported to a higher level.</desc>

		<name>Major Title 2</name>
		<desc>Major Title 2 is a golf game for up to four players who choose to play as one of four different golfers. Each golfer possesses a unique skill-set that influences their ability to make certain types of shots (power hitter, all-round player, technician and magician). 

The game offers a choice of two different courses and provides the usual array of game modes: tournament, match play, stroke play and a skins game.

During play, the action is presented in two different perspectives. The pre-shot perspective is a standard third-person view from behind the golfer but once the ball is hit, the view switches to a top-down perspective to track the ball in flight. Once players are on the green, a window is displayed showing a zoomed-in overhead view detailing the green's contours. 

Major Title 2 takes a simplified approach to hitting the ball. Instead of setting the power and controlling the shot, the only function of the swing meter is to select the vertical angle of the shot, which sets the amount of back or topspin applied to the ball. The strength of each swing is selected prior to the shot by setting a power gauge to one of 16 levels. 

Draw and fade can also be applied to the ball by changing the players stance prior to taking the shot. However, the game specifies the maximum distance for the putter in yards, but measures distance on the greens in meters.</desc>

The game's goal is to guide a small glass marble over a three-dimensional maze and reach the finish line before the level's timer has expired. Any seconds that remain on the timer when the finish line is crossed are carried over to the next level. 

As well as having to negotiate the marble over treacherous walkways and ramps, numerous obstacles and unfriendly creatures will try to slow the marble's progress or knock it over the edge of a platform, wasting yet more precious seconds until a replacement marble appears. The two-player game has players competing to reach the goal first.

		<name>Mario Bros.</name>
		<desc>Mario Bros. is a superb, single-screen platform game in which the legendary "Mario Bros.", Mario and Luigi, must try to rid each level of a number of pests that have infested the waterworks: Shellcreepers (turtles), Sidesteppers (crabs that need to be hit twice) and Fighterflies (flies that can only be attacked when they touch a platform).

Players can jump upwards to hit the platform above them, which will 'flip' any enemies on the above platform onto their backs. The prone enemies can then be kicked into the water to remove them. A 'POW' button also appears on a number of screen; this can be 'butted' by a player, causing all on-screen enemies to flip onto their backs; as well as destroying any enemy fireballs that may be around. Each POW can only be used a maximum of three times. 

As well as the game's enemies, players are also hampered by the huge amount of inertia that comes into play when controlling Mario or Luigi. This is due to the low degree of traction that exists between the Mario brothers and the platforms. On later phases, ice appears on the platforms reducing the amount of traction even further. As the game progresses, water droplets hang below the platforms and freeze into deadly icicles, which will eventually break off and fall.</desc>

		<desc>Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes is the fifth Marvel Comics-licensed fighting game by Capcom and the third game in the Marvel vs. Capcom series. In contrast to X-Men vs. Street Fighter and Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, the game features characters from numerous Capcom franchises such as Mega Man and Strider, rather than just Street Fighter characters. The game takes place within the Marvel comic continuity, as Professor Charles Xavier calls out for heroes to stop him before he merges with the consciousness of Magneto and becomes the being known as Onslaught, the final boss. The game was developed in late 1997 and first released in January 1998.</desc>

On such occasion, it occurred to humankind that mysterious disappearances of women rise in waves in many places in the world. The cause is found by the investigation of a secretly organized 'Defending-the-earth-from-the-outside-organization'. That is, a strange contagious disease prevails throughout a planet 'Zancs' in a dark nebula, and women's generative power is lost, then, women on the earth were abducted as substitutes for having their descendants. Downson and Bogey, the choice out of the 'Defending-the-earth-from-the-outside-organization'. start on a journey to the space by using 'Megablast' which is a space fighter equipped with all available products of the earth's scientific power in order to rescue the earth women as well as lovable 'Sindy' who is also abducted together with the other earth women.</desc>

		<desc>Earth is under attack from an alien race from the 'Nemesis' region of space, and human civilisation now stands on the brink of collapse. The invaders have utilised energy molecules - known to earth scientists as 'Newalones' - to create powerful beam weapons with which to attack Earth. In response, Earth's scientists have developed the 'Black Fly' project; a powerful space craft that utilises the same Newalone molecule technology of the alien aggressors.

Metal Black is a very playable sideways scrolling shoot-em-up which manages to feel different to other games in the genre, due to the fact that it lacks a a player-definable weapon power-up system. Instead of collecting items that provide extra speed, different weapons etc. players must collect the clusters of 'Newalone' molecules that float around each level. These molecule clusters will gradually increase the player ship's firepower.</desc>

		<desc>Metal Clash is a futuristic fighter game for one or two players. In one player mode, the player pilots the metariod 'Saiber' to annihilate the alien robots.  

The player pilots his robot around the screen destroying enemy robots using punches and kicks. Flying saucers can be destroyed for a life energy boost.  Items in the background can be destroyed for points. After defeating a set number of enemies the stage's boss will appear. The boss is more powerful than regular enemies, and has his own life energy bar shown on screen. Some of these bosses can be disarmed of their powerful weapons (such as guns and energy shields) which the player can equip and carry on into further levels.

When hit by enemies, the player will lose energy and will drop any weapons that he has equipped. When the player's life energy is completely depleted he will lose a life. The game is over once all of the player's lives are lost.  The game features no continues.

The two player game is a vs. match between players. Gameplay continues until one player has lost all of his lives.</desc>

		<name>Metro-Cross</name>
		<desc>Metro-Cross is an abstract, horizontally-scrolling single player racing game set in an automated futuristic city. Players take on the role of 'The Runner', who must run through each of the game's 32 stages to cross the finish line before the time limit expires. If the Runner finishes a round within the time limit, remaining time is converted to bonus points and the next round begins. 

Obstacles that hinder the runner's progress include 'Slip Zones' that slow him down if he tries to run over them, 'Pitfalls' that  break under the Runner's weight and drop him into the holes and 'Crackers' that launch the Runner up into the air and cause him to land on his back. Later rounds also feature 'Jumbo Tires' that bounce towards the Runner, barriers that emerge from the ground before receding back into it, Cubes that move through particular columns of tiles, Mice that attempt to jump onto the Runner and slow him down and Chess Knights and Kings that bounce from one tile to another. Clinging mice fall off the runner if he leaps from a springboard.

Progress is aided by yellow springboards that hurl the runner forwards at great speed (players must press the fire button while on the springboard) and a skateboard, that is unaffected by the green 'Slip Zone' tiles that would otherwise slow the player's progress. Bonus points can be earned by kicking the static drinks cans that can be found throughout each level.

Every fourth round is special, using the remaining time from the three previous rounds as additional completion time. However, if the Runner has not finished the round before the time limit runs out, he will be electrocuted and the game is immediately over.</desc>

		<desc>"Midnight Resistance" is a scrolling platform shoot-em-up for one or two players, taking on the role of two commando brothers whose entire family has been kidnapped and must be rescued. The game consists of nine large, eight-way scrolling levels made up of platforms, ledges and ladders. Each is populated with enemy soldiers and gun emplacements, as well as occasional armoured vehicles. At the end of each stage players must defeat a large, powerful enemy boss. 

Players can rotate their guns through 360 degrees, allowing them to fire in all directions. Some enemies, when killed, will drop a red key; collecting these keys allows players to upgrade their weapons at the shop that awaits at the end of each level. A maximum of six keys can be carried at any one time and when the player loses a life, all weapons and keys in their possession are dropped. These can be recovered at the start of the next life providing they haven't fallen off-screen. 

In addition to main weapon upgrades, secondary weapons can also be bought. These appear as backpacks attached to the player characters and fire when the player pushes up on the joystick while firing their main weapon. Both the main and secondary weapons have only a limited amount of ammo but more can be bought from the end-of-level shops.

		<desc>
Millipede is a 1- or 2-player game with a color raster-scan video display. The game action takes place on a playfield filled with mushrooms, flowers, and deadly DDT bombs. The player tries to destroy a variety of insects that drop from the top of the screen or enter from the sides of the screen, most of them to attack the player. The player controls a bow-shaped vehicle called the Archer. The object of the game is to shoot and destroy as many objects as possible for a high point score, before the player's lives are all used up.

Player control consists of a Midi Trak-Ball control and a FIRE button. The Archer is moved by rotating the Midi Trak-Ball control. The Archer can be moved in all directions, but only within the bottom fifth of the screen. However, the Archer must move around mushrooms, flowers, and DDT bombs, since these are fixed and not 'transparent' objects. Pressing the FIRE button causes the Archer to emit an arrow that travels upward. The Archer may fire one or many arrows (by holding down the FIRE button constantly). But only one arrow will appear on the screen at a time.

		<desc>A horizontal tank shooter game, with great atmosphere Parallax scrolling background.

The mid-day heat is rapidly becoming unbearable as the supply helicopter lowers your battle tank on to edge of the desert. You have a whole day's travelling ahead, 90 miles across the seemingly endless desert, until you reach the target of your mission - the enemy's desert fortress. Only after you have managed to destroy it, will it be safe for the transport helicopter to collect you and send you on another full-scale mission.

Unfortunately, the going across the desert is not easy. Your tank has run out of super-missiles and you must replenish your armoury from the stockpiles on the way. If you don't collect enough you will not be able to destroy the forts and the enemy base, which is so well protected you need three missile hits to put it out of action. However, you have unlimited supplies of shells for your heavy duty gun that can fire in all directions.

		<name>Mirai Ninja</name>
		<desc>The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Future Ninja - Stealth Joy Cloud Device Side Story'.

Mirai Ninja was based on a Japanese movie of the same name, also produced by Namco. Both the game and the movie were released the same year.
The plot of the movie: A man's body and soul are stolen and used as part of a demon castle. What's left becomes Cyber Ninja. He teams up with the chi students whose cyber-earmuffs show matching red symbols. They fill their swords with ammunition, grab some neo-retro-cyber-antique guns and attack the demon robot expendable ninja squad. Each fight is won by whichever side uses more gratuitous special effects. They slay the Tron-like hover droids, who are destroyed in their shame. There's a showdown with a white-armored guy with dreadlocks, who is later reincarnated by the eclipse and a lot of multicolored lightning. After killing the make-up wearing effeminate spider person, the chi school fires a giant gun at the demon castle spider cyber robot. It blows up.</desc>

		<desc>Missile Command is a one or two-player game depicting the outbreak of a nuclear war. Players must defend six cities from waves of incoming nuclear missiles by launching their own anti-ballistic missiles (ABMs) from one of three missile batteries. 

The game is played by moving a cross-hair across the sky and pressing one of three buttons to launch an ABM from the corresponding battery (either Alpha Base, Delta Base or Omega Base). Upon reaching the cross-hair the player's ABM explodes, creating a fireball that lasts for several seconds and destroys any enemy missiles that enter it. Each battery is initially armed with ten anti-ballistic missiles and becomes useless when either all of its missiles have been fired or it's been destroyed by enemy missiles.

Instead of bubbles, MPE players (most of whom are presented as schoolchildren in pastel-colored fantasy costumes) stack coins that combine to make higher denominations--five 1 coins will turn into a single 5, two 5's become a 10, five 10's turn into 50 and so forth, on up to 500 (two of those will disappear completely). One-player games offer either solo endurance rounds or matches against a ladder of CPU opponents, but as with MD, it's the two-player mode that makes the game the most fun.</desc>

		<desc>MONSTER BASH is a fascinating cartoon theme game featuring colorful graphics in three exciting scenes of hunt-and-hide adventure. Light-hearted, suspenseful music and audio sounds add to the fun, and heighten player interest and intrigue.

DRACULA'S HOUSE
The player-hero of the game is LITTLE RED, a wily, red-headed boy who chases Dracula throughout his five-story haunted house. Up and down staircases and through Warp Doors leading to secret passageways, Little Red zaps defending bats while attempting to light candles in certain rooms. When a candle is lit a Magic Sword is energized with mystical powers. Little Red must touch the flashing Magic Sword to gain SuperZap power... only a SuperZap will defeat the sly Dracula.

FRANKENSTEIN'S CASTLE
Little Red enters the eerie castle of the hulking Frankenstein. He pursues Frankenstein around his six-story castle while avoiding the fierce Wolfmen.  The tricky Wolfmen can be zapped, but be careful, they can duck under the zap and attack Little Red. Fewer candles are now available to be lit. Warp doors to secret passageways can be used only when they flash. Special jump-down zones allow Little Red to jump down several levels at once, eliminating any Wolfmen in the way as he descends, but Frankenstein can only be defeated with a SuperZap.

CHAMELEON MAN'S GRAVEYARD
The greatest challenge yet... to dispatch the sneaky Chameleon Man and his horde of Spiders.  Entering the spooky graveyard, Little Red finds that only one candle is available for lighting which is found in a crypt guarded by giant Spiders. Chameleon Man changes his color to match that of the background and thus becomes invisible. Little Red must pass over one of the Color-Change Spots to change the background color making Chameleon Man visible again. Chameleon Man can do away with Little Red with a flick of his long tongue. Chameleon Man can only be done in with a SuperZap.</desc>

		<name>Moon Cresta</name>
		<desc>Moon Cresta is a single screen shoot-em-up with the player controlling an armed ship that moves horizontally along the bottom of the screen and must use their ship to destroy waves of attacking aliens. 

The player begins the game with a small ship armed with a single laser cannon. Upon successful completion of the first four waves of alien attacks, the player's ship will be able to dock with the next 'stage' of fighter ship, although the docking procedure must be completed within a set time. This larger, two-stage ship has increased fire power (three lasers).

After successfully clearing a further two alien waves and surviving a meteor shower, the two-stage ship will be able to dock with the third and final piece, giving the player the largest and most powerful ship, which is now armed with five lasers. Bonus points are awarded depending on how quickly the docking procedures are completed.

If the multi-stage ship is hit, the player continues with whatever stages remain. If players achieve a score of 30,000, they are awarded a free game and their score continues to accumulate.

Upon completion of the first eight screens, the player's ship will revert back to its small, single-stage incarnation and the game begins again with an increased level of difficulty.</desc>

		<name>Moon Patrol</name>
		<desc>Moon Patrol is a horizontally-scrolling shoot-em-up in which the player takes the role of a Luna City police officer assigned to Sector Nine, home of the toughest thugs in the galaxy. 

The player controls a moon buggy that travels over the moon's surface, trying to avoid or destroy any obstacles in its path, including craters, rocks and mines. UFOs attack the buggy from above by dropping bombs, some UFO bombs will create a new crater when they hit the ground, generating a new obstacle to avoid.

The buggy can jump to avoid craters, mines and rocks, it also has both front and vertically-mounted cannons that fire missiles simultaneously. The vertical cannon is to destroy UFOs while the front-cannon can take out obstacles that lie in the buggy's path.

Moon Patrol has five different stages spread over 26 check-points, each designated a letter of the English alphabet. The five checkpoints that denote a new stage are E, J, O, T and Z and each new stage sees a change in background graphics as well as an increase in difficulty. One example of this is the introduction of landmines in the third stage (stage 'J').

A status panel is displayed at the top of the screen that gives the player useful information. A progress bar showing the five major checkpoints and the player's current position is displayed at the bottom of the panel. Above the progress bar is an indicator of the current checkpoint, the time spent in the stage and three indicator lights: the top light indicates upcoming enemy aerial attacks, the middle one indicates an upcoming minefield and the bottom one indicates enemies approaching from behind.

At the end of each stage bonus points are awarded based on how quickly the stage was completed.

		<desc>The object of the game is to bump your enemies - space bugs - off the solar base using Motos, your ship. When you bump all of them off, you move to the next base or round. If Motos is knocked off the base, you lose one life. The game is over when you lose all your lives.

You can collect Power parts and Jump parts lying on the solar base by simply having Motos touch them. The collected parts will be displayed in the lower left corner of the screen and you can use them in the next round. Motos can be outfitted with no more than seven power parts; the more power parts added, the more powerful Motos is. However, Motos can only be outfitted with only one jump part per round. With a jump part, Motos can jump over two squares by moving the joystick in the desired direction and pressing the Jump button. One jump on a square cracks the square and a second jump in the same spot makes a hole in the solar base.

You can outfit Motos with these parts in the Power Parts or Jump Parts screen displayed at the beginning of each round. Select the number of parts you want by moving left and right with the joystick, and lock them in place by pressing the Jump button. You can use the selected parts for one round only; they will not be available in subsequent rounds.

Linger too long on the playing field and Shooting Stars will begin to fall periodically onto the solar base. The Stars are aimed at Motos, and when they miss they crack a square or break a hole in the solar base (like they do to the base behind the Motos logo in the attract mode's title sequence).

		<name>Mr. Do!</name>
		<desc>Mr. Do! is a colourful and addictive maze game in which the player takes on the role of the eponymous Mr. Do, a circus clown, who must clear each level of either cherries or monsters. The game's single screen levels are made up of tunnels surrounded by a colourful, soil-like substance. This soil can be dug through to create new tunnels, allowing Mr. Do to escape his enemies and to reach the many cherries that litter the levels. A number of apples are also scattered around each level, and Mr. Do can push them along tunnels (to block and/or kill monsters) or can tunnel beneath them to drop them onto the heads of any pursuing enemies. Mr. Do himself can also be killed by a falling apple.

Mr. Do is armed with a 'Powerball' that can be fired down a tunnel, it will then bounce around the tunnels until it either returns to Mr. Do, or comes into contact with, and kills, one of the level's monsters. The Powerball regenerates immediately the first time you use it, but takes longer each time it is used to return to your hands. As each level progresses, the monsters themselves start to dig tunnels of their own in their pursuit of Mr. Do. Monsters can also push the apples.

Each screen has a doorway through which the monsters enter the level. Once all of the monsters have appeared, the doorway will turn into a 'prize', (ice cream, biscuits, etc.). If Mr. Do collects the prize, the 'Alphamonster' and his three 'Muncher' henchmen will appear. The Alphamonster may be in the EXTRA box at the top of the screen or be moving around the screen. The Alphamonster and the Munchers cannot be easily crushed under apples because they tend to eat them. They can be killed individually with the Powerball or by killing the Alphamonster itself, at which point any remaining Munchers will turn into apples.

After every three levels, there is a brief intermission in which a tune is played and a large, animated Mr. Do appears, together with some of the game's monsters. The time to complete each level and the preferred method (monsters, cherries, Alphamonsters, or Diamond) is shown. The paths in the first level resemble a 'D', after this each level's tunnels resemble a digit, ('2', '3', '4' etc.) up to '0' for level 10.

A level can be completed any one of several different ways: either by collecting all of the on-screen cherries; by killing all of the monsters, by completing the EXTRA box, or by collecting the diamond. The latter appears only very occasionally ('Special' awards an extra credit).</desc>

		<name>Mr. Do's Castle</name>
		<desc>For the second game in the Mr. Do! series, the clown finds himself in a traditional platforms and ladders game. Each level is made up of six floors (seven including the castle's ramparts) and all are joined by a number of inter-connecting ladders. The ladders come in two different varieties: vertical ladders, which are fixed and cannot be moved; and diagonal ladders, which can be pushed left or right from the top of the ladder. This allows Mr. Do to reach other areas of the level and is sometimes necessary to redirect the path of any pursuing enemies. 

The enemies in Mr. Do's Castle come in the form of unicorns, and as with the enemies of the first game, they will hunt down and try to kill Mr. Do. Replacing the 'Powerball' weapon of the original game, Mr. Do is now armed with a mallet. This can be used to temporarily stun the unicorns and buy Mr. Do some time to escape; but its primary function is to knock out the floor blocks that form each level's platforms.

Most blocks are marked with a cherry and collecting all of these will complete the level (on later revisions only, see Updates below). A level can also be completed by killing all of the unicorns. This is achieved by using the mallet to remove blocks and knock holes in the platforms. The unicorns will fall into any holes that the player has created; some simply fall through to the platform below, whereas others are trapped. Trapped unicorns can be hit with Mr. Do's mallet and knocked to a lower platform - useful for buying a few extra seconds for the player. If left alone, however, the unicorns will climb out, filling the hole in behind them, and transform into much nastier enemies. These new enemies cannot be stunned with the mallet and must be killed by dropping blocks onto them from the platform above.

Some sections of a platform have two 'skull' blocks at either end of them, with normal blocks in between. When both skull blocks are knocked out with the mallet, all of the blocks in between will fall to reveal wooden floorboards. This is highly effective in killing several enemies at once.

Each level also has three 'key' blocks. If Mr. Do knocks out all three key blocks, a large door opens at the top of the screen to reveal a shield which, when collected, turns the unicorns into 'Alphamonsters'. The Alphamonsters flee from Mr. Do and can be killed either with the mallet, or by dropping a floor block onto them from above. When Mr. Do kills an Alphamonster, its letter appears on a flagpole at the top of the screen. If the players collects all five letters, an extra life is awarded.</desc>

		<name>Mr. Do's Wild Ride</name>
		<desc>Mr Do's third arcade outing is another platform game, following on from the superb "Mr. Do's Castle", released a year earlier. The synonymous Mr. Do! cherries are present and correct, but are not used in the same way as in other games in the series. In both "Mr Do!" and "Mr. Do's Castle", collecting all of the cherries available was a way of completing a level. In Wild Ride, however, collecting them merely changes the 'prize' awarded upon reaching the level's goal. This can be one or two letters from EXTRA, or other items which simply award bonus points. When Mr. Do reaches his goal, he waves a flag while the bonus counter is added to his score.

The gameplay is similar to that of Nintendo's legendary "Donkey Kong", with Mr. Do starting each level at the bottom of the screen, trying to make his way to the exit at the very top. Mr. Do doesn't have either his Powerball or mallet in this game, but holding the ACTION button makes him run faster along the track. The trade-off of this is that his bonus points deplete much quicker. When all of the EXTRA letters are collected, the player is awarded with an extra life.

Each of the game's six levels is set on a roller coaster, with each having its own theme, traps and pitfalls. Wild Ride doesn't feature the intermission screens that appear in previous Mr.Do games.

The levels are:
Level 1, Roller Coaster. 
Level 2, Pirate Ship. 
Level 3, Three Elevators. 
Level 4, Castle on Screen. 
Level 5, Multiple Columns. 
Level 6, Six Rings.

After level six the levels are repeated.</desc>

		<name>Ms. Pac-Man</name>
		<desc>In this, the first proper sequel to Namco's legendary pill eating maze game, players must once again run around a number of mazes, eating all of the pills that are scattered throughout. The ever-present ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Sue) return to hamper the player's progress. The infamous 'Power Pills' are also present and correct, with four appearing in each maze. 

Namco introduced a number of changes and enhancements over the original game. The first difference is in the main character. For the first time in video-game history, the game's lead character was female. Ms. Pac-Man is almost identical to the original character with two main differences; she wears a bow in her 'hair', and is also wearing lipstick. 

Another change from the original is that the bonus fruit items are no longer static but now move randomly around the mazes. 

Ms Pac-Man features four different maze layouts, which alternate every two to four rounds:

		<name>Muscle Bomber Duo: Heat Up Warriors</name>
		<desc>Professional wrestling experienced a sudden increase in popularity during the early 1980s, where many professional wrestling organizations were started all over the world. A severe rivalry existed among the organizations.

In order to resolve this conflict, 8 organizations combined to form the Capcom Professional Wrestling Association (CPWA), led by Victor Ortega, the CPWA?s first champion.

One day, Ortega suddenly vanished. He was considered to be the axis of the sport and his unexpected disappearance caused the CPWA to enter an age of confusion and disorder. The BPWA, a dark underground wrestling organization, chose to take advantage of this opportunity and began moving. With "Fighters of Muscle Bomber = Destiny" as the theme, the CPWA chief executives decided to hold a world tour called the ?Crash Carnival,? to decide the new king of the CPWA.

The gong that determines the new ?Master of Muscle Bomber? is sounded?</desc>

Mystic Warriors features five selectable characters, one of which is shown being kidnapped by SKULL once players have made their character choices. What follows is eight levels of platform 'run-and-gun' action, with an end-of-level boss waiting at the end of each stage.

Players are armed with both Shuriken throwing stars and with a sword for close encounters. Numerous boxes are scattered throughout the levels (or are being carried by enemies), all of which contain bonus items such as weapon power-ups or energy-replenishing food. Other power-ups include an invulnerability shield (known as the "Shinobi Shield") which lasts a few seconds and a "Smart Bomb" power-up, which destroys all on-screen enemies. Some boxes also contain points-giving items, such as bags of money, jewellery and gold.</desc>

There are several differently colored woodpeckers that hatch from the large eggs positioned on the left and right sides of the screen, which set out to stop him. The player has a single button with which to make Naughty Mouse jump over them.

Some of the ladders may also become electrified after Naughty Mouse has climbed them, forbidding him to go back down them again on pain of death. Once he has reached his girlfriend's house, he will receive the stage's remaining time as bonus points and proceed to the next stage.

The main difference between Naughty Mouse and Woodpecker is the color palettes, and stage arrangements.</desc>

Some blocks will uncover power-ups, and depending on which ones you collect, you will receive more bombs, more lives, more time, manual bomb detonation, expanded blast zone, and the ability to move faster. In some levels some blocks will reveal eggs that you can hatch to produce a bird that you can ride on and allows you to take an additional hit from an enemy or bomb blast without losing a life.</desc>

		<desc>Neo Turf Masters is a golf game that offers play in three different countries. You can play in the US, Germany, and Japan. There are 18 holes per course, just like in real life, which totals to 54 holes. The game features a two-player versus mode and three single player modes. You can choose from one of six different characters, who each have their own strengths and weaknesses. Like many other golf games, you use an accurate click type of play, where you click in an overhead map where you want to hit the ball, then adjust hook, slice, and power. In Versus mode, you can earn "super-clubs" that can only be used once. These can also be traded between friends.</desc>

		<name>New Rally X</name>
		<desc>New Rally-X is a scrolling, overhead mazed-based racing game in which the player drives a racing car around a maze and must collect ten yellow flags before the car's fuel runs out. In-game opponents consist of red enemy cars that pursue and try to ram into and destroy the player's car. The enemy cars are faster moving than the player's vehicle. 

The player's car automatically moves in whichever direction the joystick is pushed and if it runs into a wall, it will turn automatically and continue moving. To disrupt the chasing enemy cars a smoke-screen can be activated that trails behind the player's car, causing any pursuing vehicles to crash. Activating the smoke screen uses a small amount of fuel, however, so players must be careful to not overuse it.

Each maze also has rock formations and crashing into these will result in the loss of a player car. A radar display to the right-hand side of the playing area shows the relative positions of the flags, rocks and enemy vehicles. 

In addition to the standard ten flags, each maze also contains a special flag (indicated by the letter "S"). If collected, the value earned for the round's remaining flags doubles from 100 to 200 points. If the player dies before the end of that round, the flag value is set back to 100 points and the double bonus is lost. 

The mazes also contain a 'lucky flag'. This is marked with the letter 'L' and - providing there are still standard flags remaining - awards the player extra points for remaining fuel, after which the round will continue as normal. Upon completion of a round, bonus points are awarded based on how much fuel the player has remaining.

As players progress through the rounds, the number or pursuing enemy cars increases.</desc>

		<desc>Night Striker is a 3-D shoot-em-up rendered with fast moving, sprite-scaled graphics. Players must guide an armoured hover car through a number of scrolling levels - destroying waves of enemies in the process - in an attempt to rescue a scientist who has been kidnapped by a terrorist organization. A large guardian awaits players at the end of each level, with each one taking several hits to destroy.

Night Striker takes its influences from many landmark games of the sprite scaling genre, all of which are Sega releases. The basic shoot-em-up gameplay is similar in style to both 1985's "Space Harrier" and 1987's "Thunder Blade". Some of the game's levels resemble those of 1988's "Galaxy Force II" as well as "Thunder Blade", while the game's level structure - a 'pyramid' of levels that allows players to chose their own route through the game with the use of end-of-level forked roads - is borrowed from the 1986 classic, "Out Run".</desc>

		<desc>This was an ancient story when people still believed in witchcraft.

There lived one gravedigger at a very small village in a remote region. He lived a quiet, solitary life in a corner of the cemetery. He kept away from the village people due to his very ugly appearance. One day, he found the graves were ransacked and some corpses were stolen. He didn't want the village people to find out, so he decided to eliminate the grave burglars by himself. Thus, he patrolled the cemetery every night.

There are five stages with five levels each, and each one of them has you throwing fireballs at ghouls, ghosts, goblins, and zombies. When you keep throwing fireballs at these enemies, they will ignite into a giant fireball, which you can throw at other enemies to kill them, and get the remaining treasure before moving on to the next level. At the end of the fifth level, a boss must be defeated in order to continue the game.</desc>

		<name>Numan Athletics</name>
		<desc>An athletics game featuring 8 tournaments:

Interceptor
A real life missile defense style-contest as missiles are being launched from a ship, and you must use your mystical powers to stop the oncoming missiles. The outside buttons (1 &amp; 3) make you step to the left or right, and the middle button is fire. Failure to hit the missile results in you being blown up. If you select Sharon from France, most of her clothes would disappear except for the bottom part of her suit.

Niagara Jumps
The final competition in the tournament. It is also considered to be the most difficult competition in the game. Very similar to the Triple Jump competition in the Olympics. The object is this contest is to make it across the falls. Alternately press buttons 1 and 3 to build up speed, then press button 2 three times. If you don't time yourself properly, you will sink and drown and you will go down the steep falls.

Nonstop Rock Chop
You must smash as many rocks as you can before time runs out. Rapidly press buttons 1 and 3 alternately until the gauge is full, then press button 2 to smash the rock.

Numan Sniper
In this contest, monsters will jump out of the sea from three different locations. Your object, destroy them. Press buttons 1, 2 or 3 varying by their location to shoot.

Scud Toss
Just as in the Javelin competition in the Olympics. Played on a "Track and Field"-like field with an only exception -- a missile. Rapidly and continuously press the two run buttons and then push and hold the middle button to set the angle of which you would throw the missile. Again, like Interceptor, if you select Sharon -- then again if she is faulted, she will be missing most of her clothes.

Tower Topper
Here you are expected to climb up to the building rooftop with the fastest time possible. Press button 2 repeatedly to scale the side of a building. If you press it too early -- you won't move, but if you press it too late -- you will fall off.

Turbo Dash
Much like the 100m Dash in the Olympics -- only the core elements have slightly changed. You are racing against a drag racer and another player. Press the two outside buttons (1 &amp; 3) in alternate fashion until your RSI (or 'special speed') sets in.

VS. Express
Very similar to a familiar scene in the Superman comic books. You must stop the oncoming train using your magical powers and send it in the opposite direction backwards. Press button 2 to stop the train, then hammer the outside buttons to build up power before bunging it back down the track. If you don't time this right -- the train will run you over.</desc>

		<name>Off the Wall</name>
		<desc>Off the Wall is an arcade game produced by Atari and released in North America in 1991. A modern remake of Breakout, this game introduces many new gameplay features to the bat-and-ball genre, and it incorporates some elements from Pong as well. It supports up to three players simultaneously (though most cabinets only support two), and the game's graphics include many backgrounds modeled after modern abstract art.

The objective of Off the Wall is to score as many points as possible by destroying square blocks in a never-ending series of levels. The player controls a paddle using an analog knob or a joystick (depending on the machine configuration). The paddle moves along one edge of the playfield, and a ball flies around the playfield and bounces off the walls and the paddle. When a ball hits a block, the block disappears (unless it is indestructible). A square exit is placed on the screen, and directing the ball into this exit causes all remaining blocks on the screen to self-destruct, awarding bonus points and advancing the player(s) to the next level.

The ball occasionally splits in two (in multiplayer games, three balls may be on the screen at once), and the player can put spin on the ball, causing it to move in a curved trajectory. The player loses a life when the last ball on the screen moves past the player's paddle, though in some circumstances, the game gives the player a second chance. The game is over when the player has lost all of his or her lives.

As levels progress, the game introduces new features that make the game more complex and challenging. These features include blocks that move randomly or in circles, various powerups, indestructible blocks and bombs, blocks that parachute or fly in to replace destroyed blocks, objects that change the ball's speed and trajectory, and guns that can shrink the players' paddles. Depending on the number of players in the game, some levels may be skipped due to the exit being along one player's edge of the playfield. In multiplayer games, a bonus round occurs periodically where players compete directly against one another in an exact clone of Pong. The winning player earns an extra life.</desc>

		<name>Omega Fighter</name>
		<desc>While similar to most vertical scrolling shooters, Omega Fighter is unique in its gameplay, level and enemy focus: rather than flying through multiple levels, the player faces an enormous space battle cruiser which contains every level.

There are two weapons that the player picks up, and if the player picks up a different powerup, it will always reset to its lowest level:
(I) - Ion Laser: Shoots straight, pick up more to increase damage at a cost of decreasing length. Ideal for close combat.
(W) - Wide Shot: Shoots bullets in wider range when collecting more of them. Ideal for taking enemies from afar but deals less damage.

There are also two items that are pressed by the bomb button, and players may pick up to two of them:
Silver - Activate to slow down everything on screen. Useful to dodge bullets and getting closer for higher score.
Gold - Destroy all enemies on screen, score depends on closeness to player prior to using the item.</desc>

		<desc>Operation Wolf is a light-gun controlled shoot-em-up in which the player takes on the role of Special Forces operative 'Roy Adams' and must infiltrate and capture six heavily fortified bases, with the ultimate aim of rescuing five trapped hostages and guiding them to safety.

In order to complete each stage, the player must shoot as many enemy soldiers and vehicles as that stage requires. Enemy soldiers can throw hand grenades and knives, while enemy vehicles can shoot missiles and launch rockets. The player's ammunition and grenades are limited, but can be stocked up by shooting barrels and crates. Occasionally a high-powered machine gun power-up appears, allowing the player's gun to have unlimited ammo and an increased rate of fire for 10 seconds. Completing the 'Powder Magazine' stage fills the player's ammunition and grenade supplies to maximum.</desc>

		<name>Out Run</name>
		<desc>Out Run is a ground-breaking racing game in which the player drives a red Ferrari Testarossa through a number of colourful European locations, trying to reach each end-of-level checkpoint before the tight time limit expires.

Each of the game's stages is packed with civilian traffic that must be carefully avoided, as players try to negotiate the game's twisting, hilly roads. 

At the end of every stage players are presented with a fork in the road, allowing them to chose which route they wish to take next. This was not the first time this feature had appeared (Tatsumi's 1983 racer, TX-1, was the first to introduce forked roads).

As well as being able to choose routes, players could also - via the game's "in-car radio" - choose one of three different catchy tunes to listen to while driving. The songs are 'Magical Sound Shower', 'Passing Breeze' and 'Splash Wave'.</desc>

		<name>P-47 - The Phantom Fighter</name>
		<desc>P-47 is a two-dimensional, scrolling shooter type of game. You play as the pilot of a P-47. Your mission is to basically destroy as many of the enemies as you possibly can. This means eliminating as many air and ground units as you can. You will be going through four missions (each being broken up into two parts) and at the end of each of these parts is an enemy boss for you to tangle with. Although you have unlimited ammunition, the enemy will make you pay for the invasion into their homeland. You will be able to accomplish this with various power-ups and also a second player (if they buy in). Your mission won't be easy but it is necessary so you can secure both the skies and ground for our troops.

The game is broken up into four missions. Within these four missions, there are 2 parts. One part involves going over land and the other part has you either going over water or being up in the air. Regardless of which part you are on, you will still have to deal with the same basic things. After part two of mission four, the missions will repeat again with mission one.</desc>

		<name>P.O.W. - Prisoners of War</name>
		<desc>Prisoners of War is a horizontally-scrolling run 'n' gun platform game for one or two players in which Special Forces soldiers escape from a POW camp and must fight their way through enemy territory to reach the extraction point and rescue. 

The escaping POWs fight primarily using hand-to-hand combat, but limited-use knives and sub-machine guns can be retrieved from fallen enemy soldiers. The game consists of three action buttons for punching, kicking and jumping. There are also three special attacks performed by pressing two buttons simultaneously: a jump kick (jump, then kick), a back punch (jump and punch simultaneously) and a headbutt (punch and kick simultaneously).

The controls change when wielding a weapon; the knife is thrown by pressing the punch button, but can preserved by using kicks. When wielding the machine gun, players can fire it by pressing the kick button, or can conserve its ammo by pressing the punch button to gun-whip enemies from close-range.</desc>

Paperboy is a one or two-player game in which the objective is to deliver Newspapers to the Paperboy's customers from Monday through to Sunday. 

Each game begins with ten customers and ten non-customers. Paperboy's customers live in the brightly coloured houses, while non-customers live in dark coloured houses. To deliver to a customer, the player must throw a paper either into the customer's mailbox, or onto their front porch. Failure to deliver a paper to a customer results in the loss of that customer for the next day. Any damage done to a customer's property also results in the loss of that customer. Losing all ten of Paperboy's customers will get him fired and the game is over. However, on any day in which all customers have their papers successfully delivered, one of the non-customers will re-subscribe.

Non-customers' houses and yards are loaded with targets at which to throw your extra papers (windows, lamps, statues, etc.). Hitting these targets earns points for the "Breakage Bonus", which is displayed at the top center of the screen. The total Breakage Bonus is awarded to the player at the end of each day (or at the end of the game-whichever comes first). 

If Paperboy loses a customer, that customer's house will be dark coloured the next day. As a non-subscriber, this house now presents more targets at which to throw newspapers for building up the Breakage Bonus. At the start of each day, a map of Paperboy's route is displayed to indicate subscriber and non-subscriber houses. This helps to remind players of what customers they may have lost on the previous day and the location of remaining customers. 

Paperboy can carry a maximum of ten papers at a time, but can restock his supply by riding over paper bundles placed here and there on his route. A paper supply indicator is displayed underneath the player's score. 

While making his deliveries, Paperboy must avoid collisions with all stationary objects and other characters moving about the neighborhood. To avoid collisions, Paperboy can ride his bike anywhere - on the sidewalk, in the street, or into front yards. A collision with anything results in the loss of a life. 

In addition to the obstacles, non-subscribers are hostile towards Paperboy and will attack him and try to knock him down. If Paperboy damages a subscriber's property, that character may also attack. So the more customers that are lost, the more hostile the neighborhood becomes toward Paperboy. 

At the end of each delivery day, players have a chance to sharpen their skills by guiding Paperboy through the Paperboy Training Grounds. This obstacle course is filled with various targets at which to throw newspaper, as well as ramp jumps to be negotiated. This is a bonus round and no lives are lost for failing to reach the finish line.</desc>

		<name>Parodius DA!</name>
		<desc>

Parodius Da! is a horizontally-scrolling shoot-em-up in which the Great Octopus has threatened Earth. To help Parodius save the planet, the player and his friends must begin their search across the world to find the enemy and destroy him.   

Parodius Da! was created as a parody of Konami's own "Gradius" series of shoot-em-ups but adopted a graphical style that was entirely its own; something that becomes evident at the very start of the game when players can chose to pilot either a penguin or an octopus rather that the traditional Gradius ship. 

Parodius retains the selectable weapons system of "Gradius";  a 'power meter' at the bottom of the screen enables players to 'buy' weapons and upgrades using capsules left behind by certain destroyed enemies. Each collected capsule advances the power meter by one step. Players can activate the highlighted item at any point, after which the power meter resets. For this game, players can also choose to have weapons update automatically, with the game upgrading weapons simply by collecting the capsules.

Parodius Da! also allows players to pilot any one of four different characters: Vic Viper (from Gradius/Nemesis), Octopus, TwinBee and Pentarou. Another new addition is that of bell power-ups. These originally appeared in Konami's "TwinBee" series and act as one-time power-ups, allowing the player to destroy every enemy on screen, for example, or fire huge energy beams. 

Enemies and environments from the Gradius games and TwinBee are mixed in along with a host of anime-style opponents, including scantily-clad women. Parodius' eccentricity and unique humour is further demonstrated soon after the game begins; as players face such enemies as a giant belly-dancing woman and a half-cat/half-boat creature.</desc>

The idea is to destroy all of the on-screen enemies; once this a done, a circular key will appear; the player must pick the key up, whereupon they will be teleported to another screen which represents the second part of the stage. This screen has a silver doorway; the player must carry the key to the door - avoiding or destroying the on-screen enemies - to complete the level.</desc>

Le but du jeu, vaguement semblable au "ballon prisonnier",  est de se débarrasser de toutes les boules présentes de son coté en les renvoyant chez l'adversaire, ou mieux SUR l'adversaire. Dans ce cas vous l'assommez proprement et l'empéchez de renvoyer les siennes.
Le principe est simple mais du coup, rend ce jeu très accrocheur, malgré des graphismes sommaires et une bande son minimaliste.

		<name>Pepper II</name>
		<desc>Despite its name, there was no predecessor named Pepper or Pepper I. The gameplay is similar to the game Amidar by Konami and Stern.

There are four mazes per level in Pepper II. Each maze has exits leading to 3 other mazes. All four mazes must be filled to advance to the next level. To fill in a maze, the player maneuvers "Pepper" around different segments of the maze. As Pepper travels, he leaves a "zipper". Once he encloses or "zips" a segment, it fills in and points are awarded. If Pepper backtracks on an uncompleted segment, it unzips.

The character "Pepper" is an angel. There are two types of enemies that must be avoided: "Roaming Eyes" and the " Whippersnapper" who unzips all uncompleted, zipped segments by moving over them. Pepper's one defense is to enclose an area containing a pitchfork "energizer", which turns him into a devil for approximately four seconds. At that time he can go after all Roaming Eyes for points. At the same time, the Whippersnapper freezes. There are four pitchforks in the corners of every maze. A deluxe energizer is located in the center of each maze. This energizer alternates between being a pitchfork and a halo symbol. If Pepper encloses the middle area when the energizer is a halo, the Whippersnapper will disappear from the maze.

Points are made for enclosing a segment, consuming a pair of roaming eyes when energized by the pitchfork (similar to Pac-Man), obtaining prizes, completing a maze, and completing 4 mazes. A bonus turn is awarded at 40,000, 50,000, 70,000 or 90,000 points, depending on the dip switch settings.

Each maze also contains a prize in one of the segments. The player must enclose the area it appears in to gain the prize and points, and then the prize is shown beneath the maze.</desc>

A number of enemy creatures hinder the player's progress; these include rats, cats, dogs, bats and owls. There are 3 different levels to play through; a junkyard, a sewer and a tree.

As well as the objects that must be collected and taken to Peter's nest, additional objects can also be collected and thrown to stun attacking animals. Flying animals that have been stunned can be ridden around the screen for a short period of time. A round ends when all the desired objects have been collected and placed in the nest. Successive rounds add more objects and enemies, as well as changing the patterns of the shortcuts.</desc>

The idea is for the player to align other floating molecules onto their own molecule to create an increasingly complex pattern; this must match the "blue print" molecule that is situated in the middle of the screen. To make molecules adhere to the player's molecule, the player simply touches the target molecule with their own. If a molecule attaches in a place that does not fit the pattern shown in the middle of the screen, the player must press the reject button to make if float away. Groups of multi-coloured rotating spheres move around the screen and must be avoided.</desc>

		<desc>On stage 1, you can ignore as many yellow ships as possible, and only aim for the blue ones. When the yellow ones move off screen there is often a chance that the next wave will include a blue ship. Since the blue ships are worth more points they are worth waiting for.
On stage 2 the birds do not fire until they are fully developed. You can usually take out 3 or 4 of them before they start firing.
On stage 2 you can concentrate on continual fire on birds wings when there are only 2 or 3 remaining, as this awards 20 points per hit and does not destroy the bird. You can rack up a good score by doing this, but watch out for the falling bullets.
The asteroids positioning on the docking stage is totally random, so this stage is often down to chance. Do not use your thrusters to maximize your bonus points.
On stage 4, the ships which come down from the cloud move across you from left to right and back again. You can time your firing so that they are hit when directly above you. Note that only the mother-ship fires at you so you can take out the ships when not directly below the cloud, and be safe in the knowledge that you have no bullets to avoid.</desc>

These Martian attackers have the ability to transform from flying Martians, to walking Martians, or to UFOs. The walking Martians build barriers across the Earth City. These barriers must be destroyed.

The Earth Spaceship can be maneuvered right and left. With the use of the 'warp' button, it can be randomly relocated when necessary. These, plus a backup of stationary defense weapons, aid in protecting the Earth City and Spaceship, as well as in destroying the Martian Attackers. When all but the two final Martians have been destroyed, a tone of dusk shades the Earth City. As these two attackers meet their end, the Earth Spaceship ascends into space to meet the challenge of Stage II.

In this second stage of play, the Earth Spaceship encounters eight Space Monsters. To destroy these Monsters, they must be hit in the direct center. When a Space Monster with burning wings is destroyed, up to 400 points can be added to your score. When all the Space Monsters have been destroyed, the Earth Spaceship prepares for Stage III.

In this third stage of play, the Earth Spaceship is confronted with the Martian Space Battleship and its unseen forces. This Martian Battleship contains five closed chambers, each protected by a rocket flame. Each chamber opens periodically at random, to release a defending reserve of Martian attackers. When a flame below an open chamber is extinguished, point value of the Martian Space Battleship increases. This enemy ship can be destroyed by either eliminating all sixteen Martian attackers, or by extinguishing all five rocket flames. When the Martian Space Battleship finally explodes, the Earth Spaceship moves on to Stage IV.

This last stage of play begins with an emergency signal, SOS, SOS, SOS, AT ONCE RETURN TO EARTH. The Earth Spaceship is now ready to be guided on its journey, through a landing corridor, back to its home base. The Earth Spaceship must be carefully maneuvered around other spaceships in order to avoid destruction. Clearing flags will add bonus points to your score. When the Earth Spaceship has been safely maneuvered to its arrival target, 500 to 4,000 points will be added to your score, while bursts of fireworks greet your arrival and signal the beginning of a new round of play.</desc>

		<desc>Super Gem Fighter: Mini Mix / Pocket Fighter is a superb, abstract and humorous fighting game featuring miniaturized renditions from several Capcom fighting games; including the legendary "Street Fighter" series, as well as "Darkstalkers" and the little-known "Red Earth".

During a bout, players will be able to release coloured gems from successful attacks against their opponent, as well as from wooden chests that regularly appear. Collecting these gems will 'power-up' the player's character, giving them more powerful attacks. There are two bars and three sub-bars in the interface. The two main bars are the life bar and the super bar; the first indicates the player's health and the second their ability to throw super combos. The Super Bar itself can be filled up to nine levels, allowing players to execute more super combos. Each super combo has a level assigned to it, and it uses Super Bars depending on it.</desc>

In battle, players must defend against wave after wave of enemy planes (fighter jets and missile-dropping bi-planes) as well as enemy subs and destroyers. Players must also be careful to avoid the many mines and depth charges that litter the ocean.</desc>

		<desc>The player takes on the role of a bow-and-arrow welding pig who must protect her piglets from the pack of hungry wolves ballooning up or down the cliff face. The pig is suspended in a winch-controlled cage and must move vertically up and down, shooting the balloons and sending the wolves plummeting to the ground. Any wolves she misses will, having safely reached the ground, climb a ladder to try and bite her. Also, if any of the wolves reach the ground, more piglets will be captured by them. Mother Pig must try to kill as many wolves as possible without letting them reach the ground.

On the second level, the wolves use balloons to float upwards to the top of a high cliff. If enough of them reach the cliff, they will push a huge boulder down onto Mother Pig's cage. After this level has been completed, the piglets who have been captured are rescued and the game starts over with increased difficulty.

There is also a bonus round where Mother Pig will attempt to eliminate as many wolves on ascending balloons as possible by throwing as few slabs of meat as possible for a maximum bonus score.</desc>

		<desc>Popeye is a superb and demanding platform game featuring characters from the famous King Features Syndicate cartoon show of the same name. The aim of the game is to rescue Popeye's girlfriend, Olive Oyl. This is achieved by catching a set number of objects thrown down by Olive from the top of the screen; such as hearts, letters and musical notes. Popeye is constantly pursued in his quest by love rival, Brutus (originally known as Bluto). Popeye must either run away from Brutus or grab some spinach and punch him off the screen (he will, of course, return).

Should any of Olive Oyl's items fail to be caught, they will fall into the water at the bottom of the screen. Popeye will then have only a few seconds to retrieve the object or a life is lost. Several other Popeye characters also make an appearance in the game; namely Wimpy, Swee'Pea, the Sea Hag, and her vulture Bernard. The game's three levels are the dock scene, the street scene and the shipboard scene. These repeat with increasing difficulty.</desc>

As outlined in the family code, the bloodline must continue to grow even stronger and eliminate all those who are weak.

The Goketsuji Clan is currently the 3rd wealthiest family in the world. As a result, there are many who seek control the clan and the family fortune.

Some train endlessly building up their strength, others polish up their fighting skills with experience, and still others concentrate on their fighting spirit, all for control of the clan.

Because there were so many fighters vying for control of the clan, Oshima, the 3rd Goketsuji Leader, declared the following to all:

The clan will hold a fighting tournament every 5 years. 

The winner of this "test of strength" tournament will assume immediate control of the Goketsuji clan until the next tournament, at which time the seat for control will be open once again. Any member with blood ties to the clan may enter. 

- Decreed this day in the 14th year of the Taisho era -

One night, Oshima Goketsuji unexpectedly appeared in front of Oume and offered her help to take revenge of Otane.

According to the rules of the clan, if the leader dies or quits, one new tournament should be held immediately to find a successor.

That same night Oshima and Oume sent their servants to dispose of Otane, so while Otane slept, she was kidnapped and thrown to the ocean.

Next day Kuroko found a letter supposedly written by Otane, where she declined to her right to be the leader of the clan.

One week later all the competitors from the previous tournament and other family members were convoked to be informed about Otane's decision and the beginning of a new tournament.</desc>

Déroutant au départ, tout devient fun au bout d'une partie et l'on peut ensuite enchainer les ciseaux et autres acrobaties avec plaisir.

Des commandes simples (2 boutons - passe/tir), un choix de 4 vues différentes et une trentaine d'équipes disponibles pour essayer d'aller au bout des 7 matchs (+ 1 match bonus).

Au niveau des graphismes, on remonte hélas 5 ans en arrière, cest assez laids, très carré, tout comme les animations simplistes.
Même chose au niveau du son, on a droit au strict minimum.

Mais vous l'aurez compris le plaisir est ailleurs, dans le système de jeu original qui fait la part belle aux retournés et autres ciseaux acrobatiques.

		<desc>In a time when the industrialization of the world had just begun, various inventions appeared and changed the life of the peaceful kingdom. One of them was a propeller that evolved from pure wind generation by using the created electricity to re-rotate it. It was called 'The Professional Gear', or just 'Progear'. This invention was the key to conquer the great wide open sky. Another discovery made the ancient dream of the immortal body come true. But it was affordable only by some wealthy elderly. They formed a new council called 'the Motorouin' and declared the current government as a corruptive and greedy establishment and that they want to correct it by a new educational system, in order to create a new race of man. So they built a military force to realize the first step of their plan, which was the takeover of the kingdom. The government decided to stop the aggression by putting it's own army in motion. It was a dreadful battle with many victims. But it was won by the Motorouin. This battle is mentioned in the books of history as 'The Punishment of the Sages'.

A group of young pilots, actually children whose families were killed in that war, finally decided to fight back. They secretly developed a new powerful weapon which adults were not able to use. They called it 'Gun Flyer' and installed it in all of their planes. The Storm of Progear was about to begin!</desc>

PuLiRuLa's plot centres around the world of 'Radishland'. Each of Radishland's six towns is kept running smoothly with the aid of a giant key, which is necessary to keep the world's 'time-flow' moving. The key is stolen by a mysterious enemy and the timeflow is disrupted. Players must fight their way through waves of increasingly abstract enemies in their quest to recover the key and restore time to Radishland.</desc>

The yellow enemies move along the edges of the walls, while the green enemies move randomly and the red enemies bounce off the edges of the walls - and they all move faster, fire faster, and increase in point value, with every round. You should also watch out for "force-field" walls - they will kill your tank if it gets caught in one. If you shoot the Pulsar, it will explode into six enemies. </desc>

		<desc>An alien threat looms over the galaxy and only you and your trusty star fighter can defeat them.

Pulstar is a 2D side-scrolling shooter in which you control your ship as it makes its way past stages filled with waves after waves of enemies bent on your destruction. You can upgrade your main weapons by collecting power-ups and charging up energy allows you to release charged attacks at the cost of power-up consumption. Additionally your ship comes with an ever-prescent "option" gun pod that floats around your ship and which can be positioned in several configurations to help protect the ship or increase its firepower.

While completely 2D, the game uses pre-rendered 3D sprites and includes fully animated cutscenes between each level. Also features support for two-player gameplay.</desc>

During matches, the player's boxer is viewed from behind as a wire-frame (so the player's opponent can be seen). Players must time their punches, dodges and blocks in order to defeat the opposing boxer.

The player's opponents are each rendered as humorous cartoon-like caricatures - adding much to the game's atmosphere - and each boxer fights in a slightly different style, forcing players to adapt to their strategy. The top monitor is used for statistics while the bottom one is used to display the actual fight.</desc>

Players can hinder their opponent by forming Puyo combinations; a successfully formed chain removes some some of the player's Puyos and causes 'junk' Puyos to fall into the opponent's play area. As these Junk Puyos are transparent, they cannot be used to form a chain and can only be destroyed when a nearby chain is created.</desc>

It is instead to clear all the balls from around the level shape, referred to as the "drop token". Once this shape is freed, it explodes and the player travels onto the next level. There are 39 levels in the game, divided in groups of three levels. In the first two levels, the shape is something generic; in the third level the shape is a Zodiac sign, up to level 36 (since there are 12 signs). Level 39's shape is the Solar Symbol.</desc>

		<name>Puzzle Uo Poko</name>
		<desc>Uo Poko is a puzzle game for one or two players (co-operative). The aim is to clear the screen of coloured glass balls by dropping like-coloured balls down onto them. Connecting three or more like-coloured balls creates a chain reaction and causes them to disappear.

Balls are launched into the play area via a joystick controlled 'pinball-plunger' and as in Pinball, the further the plunger is pulled back, the further the coloured ball will travel. Mastering the strength and distance required is essential in order to drop each ball accurately onto its target. To allow players to learn how to use the plunger, the first two stages feature a guide line which shows exactly where a ball will drop. From the third stage onwards, players must use their judgement alone.

Bonus points are awarded if a stage is completed quickly enough. If too much time is taken, however, the bottom of the stage will start to rise, pushing the balls already in play towards the top of the screen. If the top of the screen is reached, the game is over.

Uo Poko features thirty stages of play.</desc>

Open up a space, and your balloon (shark-shaped if you're the boy) floats to the top, and it's on to the next floor in the tower. Sound easy? It is... at first. The tower is divided into multiple floors, with 10 stages (puzzles) per floor. There are over 50 puzzles here and the action gets pretty furious.</desc>

At the start of each level, the playing field is just a large, empty rectangle, containing the Qix - a stick-like entity that performs peculiar, erratic motions within the confines of the rectangle. The player controls a small marker that can move around the edges of the rectangle. To claim an area of the screen, the player must detach from an edge and draw Stix within the rectangle. Stix are simply lines traced out by moving the marker. When the marker traces out a closed shape, the area enclosed by the shape becomes solid and has been claimed. The player may draw either Fast Stix, which appear blue when solid, or Slow Stix, which appear red. Slow Stix take longer to draw, but are worth twice as many points. Once the player has claimed an area, the marker can safely move along the border of that claimed area. To complete a level, the player must claim 75% or more of the rectangle's area.</desc>

		<desc>Quantum is a reflex-based vector game set in the sub-atomic world of quantum physics, in which the player controls a probe (or 'Sparkler') and must fully encircle atomic particles for points without touching various other particles. Once the particles are surrounded by the probe's tail they are destroyed.

The game features numerous particle types that must be encircled and destroyed or avoided. First, there are nuclei around which electrons orbit. When a nucleus is encircled (snared) and explodes, the Electrons change into Positrons which, if they are encircled before flying off the screen, are worth extra points.

As play progresses, Pulsars appear. These travel towards the player's probe, pulsating their arms in and out as they move. The probe is destroyed if it makes contact with any part of a Pulsar. Other deadly particles include triangular Photons, self-deviding Splitters and diamond-shaped Triphons.

In later stages, the nuclei join together, forming bonds. The player's probe is destroyed if it crosses the bonds when they are red, but can safely cross when they are yellow.</desc>

The action takes place over a number of sideways scrolling levels, the bulk of which consist of straightforward platform action. On some levels, however, there are jet packs for the players to collect, and the gameplay's emphasis switched to that of a standard, sideways scrolling shoot-em-up.

The object of the game is to destroy an army of robots that have taken over an Earth colony satellite station. Each level has a boss character that must be destroyed. Upon its death it releases a door key that must be used to exit the level. Weapon and character power-ups can be collected to aid players in their task.</desc>

		<name>R-Type II</name>
		<desc>The sequel to the hugely successful original finds the evil Bydo Empire once again intent on the destruction of all mankind in this sideways scrolling, six-level shoot-em-up.

The innovative weapons system of the original game - the 'Beam Weapon' and 'Force Pod' - make a welcome return and remain unchanged for the sequel.

The tight, demanding gameplay and high emphasis on correct usage of the weapons system also return - although the sequel is, if anything, even more demanding than its already unforgiving predecessor; with more durable enemies and trickier level design. 

R?Type II features three new weapon shot types: 
Green - Search Laser - fires semi-homing lasers that can bend at 45Â° angles. 
Grey - Shotgun Laser - fires large shells that travel a short distance before exploding powerfully. 
Scatter Bomb - drops bombs to the ground; when these explode, the explosion scatters forwards along the ground. This is a supporting weapon that can be equipped instead of missiles.

In addition to the new weapons, R-type II's Beam Weapon has received an upgrade. As with the first game, holding down the fire button makes a power gauge fill up, releases the button then unleashes a powerful plasma shot. For the sequel, however, continuing to hold down the button causes the gauge to charge up further. This 'double-charged' gauge flashes blue and red and releases an even more powerful plasma burst.</desc>

Racing Hero is the spiritual successor both to Sega's wonderful "Hang-On" series, and to their most famous racing game, "Out Run".    Some of Racing Hero's stages mirrored the racing-through-traffic gameplay of the Ferrari-based racer, for example perhaps the biggest similarity to Out Run is that at the end of each stage, the player can choose which route he or she wishes to take next. This differs somewhat from "Out Run"'s highly impressive forked-road method. In Racing Hero, the player is presented with a seperate stage-select screen and simply highlights the flag of whichever country they wish to tackle next.</desc>

		<desc>As captain of the Sonic Spaceport, players must defend their station against enemy spaceships called Gamma Raiders, which attack with vengeance and swiftly retreat to formation. The object of the game is to destroy 48 enemy Gamma Raiders before there is total disintegration of all the Spaceports on the player's side.

Players can counterattack with the Rapid-Fire Laser Blaster which zooms the lasers over the three-dimensional-esque field of curving vectors, while it intercepts enemies. The lower on the radar screen that you destroy a Gamma Raider, the more points will be earned. If exploding decoys damage the Sonic Spaceport, the Laser Blaster's firing speed will reduce. The Laser Blaster's "Damage Meter" will light up as damage is incurred and when fully illuminated, will weaken the Laser Blaster's offensive powers. To reverse this, the players must attack and destroy all remaining Gamma Raiders.

Players are given a wide range of flexibility in controlling the difficulty levels of the game. Extra Spaceports are awarded at 7,000, 10,000, 15,000 and 20,000 points, as determined by the players. The initial number of Spaceports may also be pre-programmed at 3, 4, 5 or 6. When the required number of spaceships is destroyed, players receive an extra point bonus.</desc>

		<desc>This is an interesting take on the shooter genre, with three unique sections in each stage. You control a tire with the ability to jump and shoot. When you jump, you can only be hit by the enemies in the first stage.

In the first level, you need to dodge or jump over rocks as bat-like enemies rush down the screen, weaving across it. Occasionally a string of enemies will appear that give a bonus of 1000 if you hit them all. You can also pick up bonus items worth 300 points each.

In the second level, you are driving down a busy road. You need to doge cars as they erratically move across the screen. Occasionally an ambulance will drive up the screen, and if it hits a vehicle it will go flying across the screen. Watch out for the blue trucks in this section. Midway through this part, a green truck appears which drops stars. They are worth 500 each. There are broken down vehicles on the road, along with oil slicks. The pickups worth 300 points make a return.

The third level is a bonus round. You continue driving down the road, but now there are only oil slicks. You need to collect as many point pickups as possible. If you die in this section, it jumps to the next level, and you do not lose a life. You get a bonus if you get every pickup. You are then given a bonus based on your time for the last stage.

There is a difficulty spike at the third stage. The extra life is at 50000. You only get one extra life during the course of the game. The game is infinite.</desc>

The returning heroes have been asked to rescue the Rainbow Islands from the clutches of the various enemies who have overrun the islands in their absence.

Bob and Bob are each armed with the ability to create solid rainbows. This ingenious game-play device acts as both a weapon (to either kill an enemy instantly, or trap it then collapse the rainbow onto it, the latter essential for collecting bonus gems - as detailed in 'Tips and Tricks') and as a temporary platform that allows the players to reach previously inaccessible parts of the level, as they race to reach the top of the island before the game's tight time limit expires.</desc>

		<desc>In Rally-X, the player drives a car around a maze picking up all of the yellow flags, of which there are ten, before the car's fuel runs out. The game-play has a similar feel to another Namco legend, "Pac-Man"; although in Rally-X, the mazes are much larger and, with each maze having only ten flags to collect, is more sparsely populated than Namco's pill-eating legend.

In-game opponents consist of red enemy cars that try to ram into and destroy the player's car, a problem compounded by the fact that enemy cars are faster than the player's. A smoke screen can be activated which trails behind the player's car and causes any pursuing enemies to crash. Each maze also has rock formations which, if crashed into, will result in the loss of a player car. A radar display to the right hand side of the playing area shows the positions of both the flags, and the enemy vehicles.</desc>

Each player must then place a limited number of cannons inside their castle wall before the timer expires. Once the cannons have been placed the battle itself begins. Players must target their cannons onto the enemy's castle (or, in the one-player game, enemy ships and peons) and destroy as much of the enemy army as possible before the time limit expires. 

Once the battle is over the players must repair their castles, again using tetris shapes. The players' Keep must be completely encircled with castle wall or the game is over. In the single-player sea attack game, any enemy ships that manage to reach the coast nearest the player will unload peons that will attack the player's castle by land.</desc>

		<name>Real Bout Fatal Fury 2 - The Newcomers</name>
		<desc>SNK's Fatal Fury fighting series reaches its 7th episode bringing a lot of "innovations" and some significant changes, starting from characters: all the 20 fighters from previous game return with new artworks and battle stages completely redrawn, as well as some remodeled (or new) moves.

The traditional fighting system comes with sensible modifications, like the removal of both "Rank System" (SSS, SS, S, AAA etc.) and ground breakable objects. The match system using 2 battle plans (foreground/background) remains semi-intact, because now some battle fields (like Cheng Sinzan's stage) uses a single plane, forcing the players to use only the basic defense to avoid attacks.

But the main addition of this title (and the reason for subtitle "The Newcomers") are 2 new characters entering for Fatal Fury's main cast: Rick Strowd, a mysterious fighter with a particular fighting style and Li Xiangfei, a young female Chinese martial arts fighter.

		<name>Red Baron</name>
		<desc>Red Baron is a realistic flying simulation. Your player is a World War I fighter pilot searching the skies for the enemy. The horizon shifts and tilts as he maneuvers the joystick. Three dimensional hills and valleys sweep by below.

Suddenly out of the horizon, an enemy biplane appears. The pilot dives, climbs, lines up the plane in his sights! He fires a deadly hail of tracers and the enemy airplane tumbles to earth.

But watch out, there are more coming. The first four planes are relatively slow. As time progresses, the player moves more quickly and the enemy planes take more evasive action, adding to the difficulty and challenge.

Next the player faces ground targets. An observation blimp floats into view over a low rise of hills. Bright ground objects start to appear, a tank, a pill-box, then dimmer targets, a pyramid, a building. They make good targets for strafing runs but danger can appear at any time.

As the game progresses, tanks, pill-boxes and blimps will begin shooting back. The game is composed of randomly alternating series of ground and plane phases. Finally, the planes will also shoot at the player.

There are other dangers too. Dive too low and the player can crash and explode on a mountain. Squeeze the trigger too long and the guns overheat. And an enemy plane can get on the pilot's tail, almost certain death unless the player is a flying ace.

When a player is hit by a returning plane, bullet holes and cracks appear on the screen, his plane plummets to earth and explodes. If an enemy shell finds its mark, the result is the same but the shell remains visible.</desc>

		<desc>Repulse is a 1985 arcade game by Sega. It was renamed 99: The Last War when licensed to Kyugo (who developed the hardware) and Proma. There's also a bootleg version of it named Son of Phoenix.

With a spaceship, the player shoots several kind of robotic enemies and spaceships. At the end of every stage (except for the first one), the player meets a huge enemy spaceship as the stage's boss. Player's spaceship is equipped with a limited force shield which allows it to resist any kind of attack, though energy drains both while it is active and whenever the ship gets hit during use. Power-ups come in the form of ally helicopters and certain spaceships, that bring to the player a new shot(much faster than the normal one) and refills the ship's force field meter.</desc>

		<desc>The player pilots a rescue helicopter and must try to rescue numerous airmen who have parachuted into the sea below. The rescue chopper is under constant attack from enemy helicopters, while sharks swim in the ocean below and will kill any floating airmen they come across. Later levels also have enemy subs and ships all intent on foiling the rescue mission. Players must be careful to avoid the falling wreckage of any enemy helicopters they have just destroyed, and also need to be wary of hitting any parachuting airmen with their 'copter blades, as this will kill the airmen instantly.

In a very similar vein to Williams' legendary "Robotron", also released in '82, the rescue chopper is armed with a gun that can fire in eight different directions, irrespective of the direction the rescue chopper is flying in. In addition to the eight-way gun, the 'copter can also drop missiles from its underside, which is essential for destroying enemy subs and ships.

To complete a stage, players must pick up a set number of fallen airmen from the sea (determined at the start of each level) and deposit them safely onto a nearby island.</desc>

The player uses two 8-way joysticks to take  control of a futuristic vehicle. The left joystick is for moving while the right one is for firing. There is also a single button, with which to cycle through the three different types of special weapons. Its mission is to gather secret documents which shall reveal what an area of the radar map on the screen's right side is hiding - and it can also take enemy soldiers as hostages, refuel and earn more powerful weapons.</desc>

		<name>Return of the Jedi</name>
		<desc>Return of the Jedi is a scrolling shoot-em-up based on the legendary Star Wars trilogy (specifically, the third film, 'Episode VI: Return of the Jedi') and - unlike its vector-based prequel - is rendered in an isometric forced-perspective viewpoint, similar to that pioneered in Sega's 1982 classic, "Zaxxon". 

The ultimate aim of the game is to reach and destroy the Death Star and escape alive. Success is achieved by surviving an 'attack wave', which consists of four different scenes. Play switches between Endor and space-based scenes, with each one putting the player in control of a different vehicle from the movie. 

The scenes are based on three distinct locations taken from the original movie. They are: The forest moon of Endor, Attack on the Death Star, and Space battle. 

SCENE 1: Speeder Bike chase on Endor as Princess Leia. The goal is to reach the Ewok village alive. 
SCENE 2: Scout Walker chase on Endor as Chewbacca. The goal is to reach the shield generator. 
SCENE 3: Millennium Falcon attack on Death Star as Lando. The goal is to reach and destroy the Death Star power reactor. 
SCENE 4: Millennium Falcon escape from exploding Death Star. The goal is to escape the exploding Death Star. 
SPLIT SCENE: Play switches between scenes 2 and 3. 

The scenes loop for as long as the player has lives remaining; although to increase variety, the order in which they appear is randomised as play progresses. Each successive wave increases in difficulty.</desc>

		<desc>Riding Hero is a motorcycle racing game with three modes of play: W.G.P. mode, R.P.G. (Story) mode, and Multi-Play mode.

In W.G.P mode, you pick your bike that you want to use, and then race up to ten world circuits, including France, Germany, Italy, U.S.A, Spain, Sweden, and more. You race against the top riders. Try to aim for the top.

R.P.G. mode is interactive. You travel between locations, and explore them, and speak to any people here. You start with no bike, so you must go to the Bike Shop and purchase one. Then with some help with the owner, you can race against up to six opponents. The more races you win, the more money you earn. Keep winning and you will be able to race the Suzuki 8-hour. During this mode, a timer will count down. If this expires, you must insert a coin in order to continue.

Multi-Play mode lets you "link" cabinets together so that two players can race each other side-by-side.</desc>

A variety of traps and pitfalls await the Road runner - including cannons, land mines and cliff-top drops - that must be carefully avoided or negotiated. It is possible, however, to lure Wile E. Coyote into these traps to put some valuable distance between the Road Runner and his pursuer.

Piles of birdseed are littered throughout the levels and Road Runner must eat them (by running over them) whenever possible, as missing five seed piles will cause Road Runner to feel faint and stop running, resulting in his being caught by Wile E Cayote. A 'Seed Meter' at the top of the screen indicates Road Runner's seed enery level.

Road Runner's colourful, beautifully-drawn graphics capture the spirit and humour of the legendary cartoons perfectly. The music and sound effects are also faithful to the cartoon series.</desc>

		<name>Roc'n Rope</name>
		<desc>Roc'n Rope is an incredibly difficult yet playable platform game featuring four different levels. The player takes on the role of a an archaeologist whose mission is to return the missing tail feathers to the golden Phoenix. The archaeologist is armed with a harpoon gun and uses it to fire a rope into a platform above, in order to climb up the rope and progress up the level. This is vaguely similar to the superb 'telescopic arm' feature that appeared in Capcom's superb "Bionic Commando".

All levels are patrolled by enemies in the form of dinosaurs and cavemen and all are deadly to the touch. Some cavemen will pull on the harpoon rope while the archaeologist is climbing it. This will result in the player falling from the rope and losing a life. The archaeologist is armed with a light ray that will kill the enemies.

A breakdown of the game's four levels:

The first level is possibly the most difficult in the game. Players begin at the bottom left of the screen and must work their way up to the Roc, who is sitting at the upper right of the screen. There are many layers of ledges coming out from the sides of the screen. While the middle of the screen is open to the sky (except for a few floating platforms). To reach the top, players must use the harpoon gun to climb diagonally back and forth until they reach the top (ensuring that the Phoenix feathers have been collected on the way).
The second level is set underground. There are a lot of dinosaurs on this screen and far fewer platforms than on the first level. Many of the platforms stretch completely across the screen, so there aren't many pitfalls to be wary of. Once again, players must get the archaeologist to the top of the screen to complete the level.
The third level is set outdoors. A 'ferris wheel' style rotating platform sits in the center of the screen, but this can be avoided if players don't wish to use it. The easiest route to the top is on the right-hand side of the level.
The fourth and final level is shaped a little like a mountain. The player's main concern here is a large waterfall in the center of the screen. Players must time their harpoon climb just right to avoid being killed by the deadly waters. Once this level is finished, the game starts over with an increased level of difficulty.</desc>

Choose from Rockman/Megaman, Protoman or Bass and battle against classic bosses in the series. Features great 2-D graphics, solid control, and a nice use of strategy (since the right order of weapons will rid you of specific enemies in no time!).</desc>

		<name>Rod-Land</name>
		<desc>Rod-Land is a cute and colourful platform game for one or two players in which two fairy sisters - 'Tam' and 'Rit' - must rescue their kidnapped mother from the 'Maboots Tower' fortress.

The fairies are armed with the 'Rods of Sheesanomo' - two magical rods that enable the fairies to catch enemies in a force-field and slam them into the platforms to kill them - and must clear each level of enemies to move onto the next and eventually reach and infiltrate the Tower.

As well as the magical rods used for attacking enemies, the fairies can also create a magical ladder - in a fashion very similar to that used in Taito's "Rainbow islands" - which can be utilised anywhere on a level and allows players to reach other platforms or escape from pursuing enemies. Each player can utilise only one magically-created ladder at any one time and the creation of a new ladder removes the previously-created one.

A level is only completed when all enemies have been killed. Some defeated enemies drop bonus items, such as fruit, missiles and bombs.

Each of the game's levels features brightly coloured flowers. If players manage to collect all of these, the 'Extra Game' mode begins. During this time-limited mode all of the level's enemies turn red and move much faster. If the enemies are killed in time, they drop an alphabetic letter that can be collected to spell the word 'EXTRA' and earn players an extra life.</desc>

He can push the walls in the gardens over to crush the various enemies that pursue him, but they are immediately be resurrected in the form of eggs which hatch after a few seconds. Each round also has a preset time limit to ensure that the player does not dawdle - and once it runs out, a green-haired female vampire known as Tsukaima who cannot be crushed by the walls appears. The game's enemies include white blobs known as Pyokorin, flame-breathing pink Triceratops-esque creatures known as Kerara, armadillos known as Gororin which can roll over Chap, purple seals known as Todorin which can breathe ice, sponges known as Bekabeka, which can push walls onto Chap, turquoise blobs known as Fumajime Pyokorin, which occasionally pause to take a long drag on their cigarettes, helmet-wearing creatures known as Nachibo, which take two crushes to kill, wolves known as Taggus which can throw bombs at Chap, spiders known as Oogumo, which can spin webs for Chap to run into - and this game's main antagonist, an evil scientist named Gurerin who only appears in the final round, where players not only have to collect all the keys, but also push the walls onto his four clones (two of whom can breathe fire, the other two can breathe ice).</desc>

The game features ten different tracks, each with its own graphical theme. After the first race, in addition to the four racing cars a fifth 'drone' vehicle is added, whose sole intention is to hinder the four racers. The drone is visibly different from the racers and can be anything from a steam roller to a cement mixer.</desc>

		<name>Round-Up</name>
		<desc>The object of Round-Up is for the player to maneuver his white robot in 1 of 4 directions within a maze, capture a red character robot as they move about the maze, and race to the center to change the 9 white balls located there to red. The player may only change one white ball to red at a time after he has captured a red robot, and must evade 4 chaser monsters in the process. Bonus point may be earned when capturing the elusive 'red king' that appears on the screen. Capture him and momentarily immobilize the chasers, but do not come in contact with the yellow robots--or your much-needed red robots will be changed to white and force you to change strategy. Play is over when the chasers have captured all of the player's robots. But, should the player be successful in changing all of the balls in the center to red, the pattern clears and a different challenge is presented. A 3x3 or 4x4 tri-colored pattern will appear at the bottom of the screen and a slightly different tri-colored cube of corresponding size will appear at the center of the screen. The player may earn bonus points by moving the directional arrow and rearranging the colors of the cube at the center of the screen to match the sample pattern presented at the bottom of the screen. The player is given 90 seconds to rearrange the cube as many times as he can. Action returns to the maze whether you win or lose the cube challenge. All in all, an exciting and challenging game where patience and skill are required.</desc>

		<name>Rush &amp; Crash</name>
		<desc>It's the 21st century in America. Technology has improved by leaps and bounds, and now (most) people live in peace. But in a small town somewhere, a vicious terrorist group known as Zapper is terrorizing small towns and kidnapping innocent people so that they can build a secret weapon. And, as it turns out, the family and friends of someone code-named "Super Joe" just so happened to be one of the innocents caught! Now Super Joe's hungry for revenge. Can Super Joe and his armored car destroy the Zapper organization and save his town from utter destruction in time? The Speed Rumbler is a action game where the player races against the clock in an armored car piloted by Super Joe, destroying other cars and saving captives along the way. Super Joe's car is armed with a gun that he can use to shoot down enemy cars, but the enemy cars have a few tricks up their sleeve, so Super Joe should always be on guard. As the player progresses through the game's six stages, Super Joe can be given a boost by saving captives, who then award him with bonus points, increased fire power, or speed-ups. If Super Joe's car is destroyed, he can continue the fight on foot with his rifle. But unfortunately, Super Joe is not as powerful as his car - one hit and he's history. Super Joe has 24 "hours" to destroy Zapper. The game is over when Super Joe runs out of lives or time - or if he successfully completes his mission.</desc>

		<name>Salamander</name>
		<desc>Salamander is a 1 or 2 player sequel to 1985's superb shoot-em-up, "Nemesis". While it retained the same basic gameplay and feel of its predecessor (particularly the superb and innovative weapons system), Salamander featured both superior graphics and a more imaginative approach to level design. The earliest example of the latter appears towards the end of the very first level, in which imposing, organic obstructions grow before the players' eyes. The game's third level - the infamous 'lava' level - is another good example of Salamander's superb design; with huge solar flares constantly erupting both above and below the player's ship that must be carefully navigated to avoid instant loss of life. Salamander introduced further variety to the action with the introduction vertically-scrolling levels, which alternated with the standard side-scrolling levels.

Salamander's weapon power-up system is as follows:
SPEED UP: Five speed levels.
MISSILE: Press missile button to launch.
LASER: Your forward rockets turn into deadly lasers.
RIPPLE LASER: Use shoot button to fire.
FORCE FIELD: Protect your ship with barriers.
MULTIPLE: Increase your fire power by up to four times.

Multiple special powers can be obtained, but the LASER cannot be used in conjunction with the RIPPLE Laser.</desc>

		<desc>Bringing a new breath to SNK's swordsman fighting series, this 4th installment marks the return of 3 classic characters (Yagyu Jubei, Charlotte and Tam Tam, now with updated stuff), introduces 2 newcomers for the pantheon (the brothers Sogetsu Kazama and Kazuki Kazama) and brings some new backgrounds.

In spite of these little improvements, the game preserved (and improved a lot) many elements that did the previous one (Samurai Shodown III: Blades of Blood) a quite popular title, like the dodge move and the chance to choose between two versions of the fighter: the standard one and an alternative dark-styled one (SLASH and BUST, respectively).

With the intention to provide more action in the battles, the "No Contest" Moves were introduced: working in similar way (and under certain conditions) to the many games of Mortal Kombat Series, your fighter will execute an ultimate-slaughter move in a stunned opponent.

		<name>Samurai Shodown V</name>
		<desc>Seven years after the fourth game in the series, Samurai Shodown returns. In the game's time frame, this is the earliest game, hence the Japanese title Samurai Spirits Zero. It takes place in 1786 from January through the later summer. The game is therefore considered a prequel to the series.

The overall gameplay was slightly altered. It is a little faster, and the Slash/Bust system has been removed. Each character now has only one version, or the Bust mode is simply replaced by a new character of very similar setup. Combo slashes, sidestepping and fatalities have also vanished. The basic moves have been modeled after the first games in the series. They consist of three types of slashes, a single kick, and various dodge maneuvers similar to Samurai Shodown II.

There are 24 characters, a familiar cast with some new faces. Unlike the previous games, it is not possible to kill your opponent.</desc>

		<name>Satan's Hollow</name>
		<desc>Satan's Hollow is a 1- or a 2-player game. When playing this game, the Rocket Launcher is under YOUR control. YOU make it move back and forth across the screen to launch Rockets that will eliminate your attackers. These attackers are displayed in groups, called 'racks', across the top of the screen. The first rack is made up of a small number of attackers. The second rack is made up of a larger number of these attackers. And intermixed with the racks of attackers is a rack with only a single fire-breathing Devil's head. 

The attackers and the Devil's Head will try to wipe out your Rocket Launcher. If they do, you lose one player. In emergencies, you have a Shield which goes all around your Rocket Launcher for a short period of time. It is activated by pushing the Shield button on the control console. BUT BE CAREFUL!! This consumes a lot of power and will only last a VERY SHORT TIME! 

Each attacker eliminated will cause a Bridge Section to appear at the lower left corner of the screen EXCEPT: when there is already a Bridge Section there or when you have a Bridge Section in tow under your Rocket Launcher. Pick these Sections up with your Rocket Launcher and move them over to build a Bridge across the gorge at the right side of the screen leading into the land of SATAN. 

When you complete your Bridge into the land of SATAN, you can cross it and do battle with him. If you win you will be rewarded by increased fire power for your Rocket Launcher. If SATAN defeats you, you lose one player. 

As your skill level increases, the number of attackers is increased and the speed that the fire-breathing Devil's Head moves is increased also. 

Bonus Rocket Launchers are awarded to you periodically throughout the game as you reach or pass certain preselected point values. Each attacker has an assigned point value. 

The object of the game is to HAVE FUN while constantly improving your skills as you play, eliminating as many attackers as possible each time to get the highest score.</desc>

		<desc>The evil King Lion has crowned himself as the master of Fuun-Ken, a new style of martial arts that includes throwing weapons in addition to hand-to-hand combat. This does not sit well with the rest of the Fuun-Ken fighters around the world, so they all decide to beat each other up in classic 2 round fights to decide who gets to get down with King Lion himself.

Savage Reign is a one-on-one 2D fighter in which you select your character and try to defeat all challengers using your basic attacks and special moves. The game features 2 different horizontal planes to which the characters can freely jump to in order to avoid attacks a la Fatal Fury. You cannot escape completely however, as all characters have a throwing weapon they can use in different ways to reach each other no matter where they are.</desc>

However, unlike most other fighting games released at the same time, the game uses an 8-way joystick and 3 buttons: one for punching, another for kicking, and the last one first introduced in the game during the modern era of fighting games, the guard button. Every character can do moving and attacking in spite of repeatedly pressing the guard button; however, they can't block their opponents' attacks by using it. Other unique features introduced in this game are quick (or small) jumping, air-guarding, counter-attacking, guard-canceling and rush-attacking.</desc>

		<name>Scramble</name>
		<desc>Scramble is a sideways scrolling shoot-em-up in which a single player takes control of a spaceship and must try to fight through six different enemy-packed levels - destroying as many fuel tanks and ground intallations as possible - before reaching the enemy base and destroying it. 

Contact with any scenery, ground installations, enemy ships or projectyles results in an instant loss of life. The Scramble ship is armed with both a blaster and bombs. The blaster is forward-firing only while the bombs drop downwards to target ground-based enemy installations and to collect fuel from fuel dumps. 

The fuel dumps are of particular importance, as the player ship's fuel gauge constantly depletes as the player progresses through the game and the only way to re-fuel is by bombing the fuel tanks that are located on the ground throughout the levels. Fuel usage increases as the game progresses, until fuel usage actually outstrips the amount of fuel dumps available and the game becomes impossible. 

Scramble is rightly considered to be a classic and was the world's first ever 'multi-level' shoot-em-up.</desc>

Your character, Robop, must navigate his way around a playfied shooting records, snipes and bees to earn points. Gathering hamburgers, nuts, briefcases and atoms will light up the bulbs. The levels advance when all the bulbs have been lit. Robop must avoid the inchworm and pick up his hands if they become detached from his body. The game ends if all Robop hands are pushed off the screen by the inchworm or he is destroyed by the Cherry Bomb.

The left joystick moves Robop, while the right joystick fires. The joystick buttons activate Robop's Super!Charge that both speeds him up and shields him from attack.</desc>

The player maneuvers the space ranger throughout the enemy space station, which consists of 26 alphabetically ordered corridors known as "sections", starting from Section A and ending at the titular Section Z. The game is divided into five stages, each consisting of five sections (with the final stage having six sections to accommodate the spare letter). The player will fight an enemy boss at the end of each stage, concluding with the final battle against the "L Brain" at Section Z. The game's stages alternates between horizontal-scrolling stage (left or right) and upwards vertical-scrolling stages. The player will lose a life every time they get hit by enemy fire. Additional lives can be obtained if the player achieves a high enough score. The game will be over if the player loses all of their lives, although a chance to continue will be provided.

The controls consists of an eight-way joystick and two buttons, one for shooting and the other for changing the character's aim to the left or right. This allows the player to shoot at one direction while moving away towards the opposite. The player will shoot their rifle towards the left or the right with the fire button, while dropping bombs at the same time to the ground. By destroying certain dome-shaped containers, the player can obtain one of three power-up items represented by letters: S, P, and B. S increases the player's mobility speed, while P increases their firing power; each can improved for up to three increments. However, these power-ups will be lost whenever the player loses a life. The B item will simply give the player bonus points</desc>

Unfortunately for them they also get caught in a time-warping scheme caused by the evil Nobunaga who attempts to invade the time period with mythical warriors and evil creatures from the Japanese sengoku period.

The game thus takes you from the city to a spirit-realm from time to time, in which you must fight all sorts of Japanese mythical figures, and release three haunted spirits that can aid you in your battle. Collecting orbs from defeated enemies allows you heal up, gain weapons and even energy attacks and also summon the warrior forms of the spirits you released, which change your character's form and give you a new collection of attacks and powers.</desc>

As in the original, the game plays as a standard 2D side-scrolling beat 'em up, in which you have to proceed through each stage killing all enemies that cross your path and defeating the stage boss to proceed. New for the sequel is the inclusion of swords as your default weapons, which now feature both high and low attacks, as well as a block move that allows you to parry enemy attacks. Collecting orbs gives you weapon upgrades and energy attacks, as well as the ability to morph into any of the three spirits released in the original which give you a new arsenal of moves and powers.</desc>

The game incorporates a more complex fighting system similar to a one-on-one fighting game, by giving players different attack buttons, special moves based on directional inputs, combos and even a super bar used to unleash devastating super moves. You cannot change weapons or transform into other characters as in the previous games, but you can acquire different ranged weapons for additional attacks as well as unlock certain bosses to increase your available characters.</desc>

Shadow Force has 6 buttons: 2 for punches (low and high) 2 for kicks (low and high) 1 for jumping and 1 for possessing an enemy. Additional attack moves can be utilised by moving the joystick up or down and pressing punch and kick buttons. It's also possible to combine punch and kick attacks to obtain different combos and while the enemies can do the same, the number and variation of their attacks is generally lower than those available to the players.

In addition to being able to possess nearby enemies, Shadow Force also features something else new to the side-scrolling beat-em-up genre; at the end of each stage players take part in a bonus round consisting of a one-on-one fight. 

Players can choose to start on any one of the first three stages and the game features 14 different possible endings.</desc>

		<name>Shinobi</name>
		<desc>Shinobi is a scrolling platform beat-em-up in which the player takes on the role of Joe Musashi, a Shinobi Ninja, who must fight his way through 5 tough missions - each made up of between 3 to 5 stages - in his quest to rescue the kidnapped Ninja children of the Iga clan; now hostages of an evil Ninja syndicate called "Zeed". To complete a mission, the player must rescue all of the kidnapped children on each level, with the number of hostages remaining displayed on a meter in the bottom left corner of the screen.

Shinobi was a huge success for Sega, and deservedly so. Its perfectly realized blend of platform and fighting action and is as fine an exponent of the 'easy to get into, difficult to master' gameplay ethic as video games have seen.</desc>

The object of the game is to go toward the end of the level and defeat the end-of-level boss, which is usually a huge vehicle. Crates that are scattered throughout the levels can be broken into to reveal new weapons and power-ups.

There is a team mode where players have to select three characters. The characters can be switched on-the-fly during gameplay, which is useful if one of them is badly injured. Players can use the other teammates until life-ups can be found.</desc>

Side Arms is a horizontally - and occasionally vertically - scrolling shoot-em-up for one or two players. Each player has two fire buttons, one for shooting ahead and one for shooting behind; crucial for a game in which enemies attack from all directions. Shooting certain enemies will reveal power-ups - displayed as 'POW' icons - and shooting the icons will either change their type, or reveal a special weapon. </desc>

		<desc>Skull &amp; Crossbones is a swashbuckling adventure in which players portray two pirates competing for food, drink, booty, and revenge. Players use a joystick and button to control the unique sword-fighting action.

The game begins with an encounter with the evil Wizard, who robs our heroes of all of their booty. The pirates swear revenge and set off on a quest to destroy the Wizard and recover their treasure.

The adventure takes them around the world. The pirates battle the fierce captains and crews of opponent ships. They encounter the soldier guards and the merciless Executioner in the Spanish castle. In the ninja camp they fight the Ninja Master and his followers. On the beach the heroes encounter the dreaded Medusa and a horde of wicked skeletons that rise from the dead.

Finally, the pirates reach the Wizard's Island, where they must again do battle against the shadow figures of the Executioner, the Ninja Master, and the Medusa before they can fight face-to-face with the evil Wizard. If they make it to the throne room and overcome the Wizard, players are rewarded with a room full of treasure.

Players use a joystick and sword button in a combination of defensive and offensive maneuvers to battle the various enemies. Players can learn the lunge and back-slash, two. skilled sword-fighting moves that are the most effective.

In order to increase the long-term appeal of the game, players can select various difficulty levels of easy, medium, and hard to vary their paths through the game. By selecting the longer hard path, players are rewarded with more food, drink, and booty along the way.</desc>

These missions involved bombing specific targets. This would seem easy, however, there are a few obstacles Sky Kid must overcome to get to the target safely. First, the bi-plane is not equipped with the bomb. Sky Kid must pick up the bomb en route to the target. Second, there are both ground and air units that attempt to keep Sky Kid from accomplishing his mission. Last, Sky Kid may have to navigate through some very inhospitable terrain or navigate around cities in order to get to the target. The targets that Sky Kid must bomb will either be a fortress complex or a ship. As one moves farther up in the missions, it isn't uncommon to have multiple targets in one mission. Perhaps barnstorming would have been a better idea.</desc>

		<desc>Sky Soldiers is a vertical scrolling Shoot em' Up developed by Alpha Denshi and released to arcades in 1988 by Romstar in North America and SNK for the rest of the world. The game features a time travel theme as well as an organized weapon select screen at the beginning of each stage.    Players travel back in time starting in Great Britain 1945, Germany 1915, Japan 1945, Germany 1944, Vietnam 1974, France 1914, Russia 1974 and finally the space station in the present time, 2110. Each time stage has two levels, both ending in a boss battle save for the final stage, resulting in a total of 15 Areas.    The ship's weapon system is accessed in the beginning of each stage. The shipâ€™s main shot consists of a semi-automatic Wave Shot. The shipâ€™s bomb weapons include forward firing missiles, fireballs, homing missiles and the buster bomb. The ship can be equipped with only one bomb weapon from either category at a time. The ship can only be loaded with a certain number of Bomb weapons and they can only be resupplied at the end of the level. The only pick-up item in the game is a parachuting human pilot shot down from malfunctioning fighter planes/jets; collecting these pilots results in random bonus points.</desc>

		<desc>Secret Agent is a side-scrolling platform shoot-em-up which the player takes on the role of a James Bond-esque secret agent who must fight his way through a terrorist group called 'CWD' to reach the final Boss confrontation and prevent a stolen nuclear missile being launched.

The player starts the game armed only with a pistol, and this has a limited amount of ammunition. Once the ammo has run out, players can only kick their enemies. Machine guns are occasionally dropped by defeated enemies and can be picked up and used. Also, Golden Gun components are sometimes dropped; there are six of these in total and once all have been collected, the player is rewarded with a very powerful golden rifle. This weapon kills all enemies instantly but will only last for twenty-five seconds, indicated by a meter at the top-right of the screen.

Most of the game's eight stages are platform-based, but there are also two underwater scuba levels and a motorbike chase. All of the game's end-of-level bosses reappear on the final 'underground lair' level.

While not officially licensed as a James Bond game, Secret Agent is unmistakably meant to represent both the Bond character and movie series. The Bond villain Jaws shows up at the end of stage two and another famous Bond villain, Odd Job also appears. Another memorable Bond reference is the use of a Shaun Connery impersonator who tells players that they have done a Great job upon completion of a level.</desc>

		<name>Snow Bros. - Nick &amp; Tom</name>
		<desc>One or two players take on the roles of snowmen Nick and Tom as they battle a variety of monsters over fifty platform-based, single screen levels. 

The snowmen can throw snowballs at the enemies with the aim of encasing them completely in snow. The encased enemies can then be kicked in order to destroy them and this is achieved by standing next to the snowball and pressing the "kick out" button. This sends the giant snowball flying around the screen, killing any enemies that lay in its path. 

If players take too much time to complete a stage, an evil pumpkin head will appear and try to kill them. The pumpkin is invincible but can be stunned with snowballs. After a short time the evil pumpkin will spawn ghosts that can travel freely around the stage as they seek out Nick and Tom. These ghosts can't be killed or stunned, so the player's only hope is to avoid them while eliminating the remaining standard enemies, to move on to the next screen as soon as possible.

When players defeat an enemy, it may drop a coloured potion bottle. These can be picked up and act as power-ups:
Yellow = Long shot
Red = Speed up
Blue = Bigger snowballs (encases monsters quicker)
Green = Inflates the players like a balloon and lets them fly around the screen, killing any monsters they touch.

Every 10th level features a battle with a large end-of-level boss.</desc>

		<desc>Solar Fox is a space shooter and a Pac-Man type game all in one. The playing field is square and only has walls on the outside. Each wall has a moving cannon mounted that will fire odd shaped torpedoes at your ship. Scattered around the inside will be a bunch of pellets in various simple patterns. To complete each level you have to drive over, or shoot all of the pellets. If done quickly enough the game will skip a level (going from 1 to 3, etc), and award you point for the level skipped.

If you select Novice difficulty at the beginning, the Solar Fox's normal speed will be slow, and pressing the Speed Button will speed it up. If you should select Expert difficulty, its normal speed will be faster, and pressing the Speed Button will slow it down. Every fourth rack is also a bonus rack, and if you die in one, it will not cost you a life. After clearing ten racks, a player becomes a member of the "10-Rack Club" and the game will continue on as normal.</desc>

		<name>Solomon's Key</name>
		<desc>Solomon's Key is a single player platform/puzzle game in which the wizard Dana is on a quest to retrieve Solomon's key and vanquish the demon hordes that have broken through into his world. To achieve this Dana must advance through the fifty rooms of 'Constellation Space', before finally reaching the magical key.

Dana is armed with a magic wand that can be used to both destroy and create granite blocks, while blocks situated directly above Dana's head can be destroyed by repeatedly jumping up into them until they shatter. The blocks act as platforms, as well as barriers to defend Dana from the numerous patrolling enemies. Each room contains a golden key, retrieving this automatically opens the room's exit door and players must then try to find/create a safe route past the constantly spawning demons to reach the exit and progress to the next room. 

Bonus Items - some hidden inside pre-existing granite blocks - are scattered throughout each room. Collecting these earns the player extra points. Power-ups can also be found, these appear as potion bottles with a flame emblazoned on them and a maximum of three can be carried at any one time. When a potion is used, Dana shoots a fireball which will move along the walls and platforms until it hits and kills the first demon it comes into contact with.

As well as bonus items and power-ups, each room also contains a hand-bell. When collected this triggers the release of a trapped fairy, the fairy will then slowly fly around the room and can be rescued for bonus points. An extra life is awarded for every ten fairies rescued.

The game's levels are based on Zodiac star constellations. The main levels are divided into groups of four - making a total of fourty-eight standard rooms - with each group representing a separate constellation. In addition to the standard rooms, each constellation also has a secret bonus room that can only be accessed by finding the given constellation's 'Seal', which is located in the last room of each group. There are three further secret rooms - 'Page of Time', 'The Page of Space' and the 'Princess Room' - that are only accessible if the player has found the 'Hidden Seals of Solomon'.

The four room groups are:
1-4 Aries 5-8 Taurus 9-12 Gemini
13-16 Cancer 17-20 Leo 21-24 Scorpio
25-28 Libra 29-32 Virgo 33-36 Sagittarius

		<name>Son Son</name>
		<desc>Son Son is a 2-D sidescrolling platformer. The screen scrolls automatically, only stopping to fight major enemies. The screen features six continuous platforms that occasionally feature small gaps. Sonson and Tonton walk automatically across these platforms. Pressing up or down will cause them to jump up or down to the next platform. Pressing left causes them to move more slowly than the screen scrolls, essentially continuing to move forward but at a reduced pace. Pressing right does the opposite - SonSon and TonTon will move across the platforms faster than the screen scrolls. The duo have only one attack - the ability to fire energy blasts from their staves. Touching an enemy or an unfriendly projectile causes the player to lose a life. If a player has any additional lives, they will return to the screen riding on a cloud that will give them temporary invincibility. If the player presses the control stick in any direction, the cloud will disappear and the character will resume its usual walking mode. The cloud will eventually disappear on its own if the control stick is not used.</desc>

		<name>Sorcer Striker</name>
		<desc>Sorcer Striker, released in Japan as Mahou Daisakusen (Magic Armageddon) is a 1993 medieval-themed scrolling shooter developed by Raizing (now known as Eighting) for the arcades and later ported to Sharp X68000 and FM Towns computers and the EZweb mobile phones. It is the first game in the Mahou Daisakusen trilogy, which includes Kingdom Grandprix and Dimahoo.
The game is set in a fantasy world filled with magic and magic-fueled machinery. A peaceful kingdom is under assault by the encroaching Gobligan Empire, led by a mysterious human leader known only as the Gobligan King. As the kingdom finds itself unable to drive off the Gobligan Empire's advances, King Codwenna announces a huge bounty for the Gobligan King's head. Four heroes answer the call, and set out to defeat the Gobligan King and restore peace to the kingdom.

Characters
Gain, the Warrior: A master of swords and physical combat, Gain wanders the land with his pet monkey Shain in search of the ultimate weapon. Attracted by the large bounty offered for the Gobligan King, Gain takes up arms in his ship, the Valhallyzer, against the Gobligan Empire. His signature weapon is the Buster Sword.
Chitta, the Magician: Despite her appearance as a youthful girl, Chitta is a formidable magic user and the granddaughter of a legendary hero. Bored of the quiet life of her village, she sneaks away in her grandfather's magical ship, the Gun Dalf, to seek adventure. Her signature attacks are the Thunder Beam and Ice Cube.
Miyamoto, the Samurai Dragon: Well-mannered and wise, Miyamoto the samurai dragon seeks revenge against Tsumujimaru, one of his former disciples. Tsumujimaru turned his back on Miyamoto's teachings and murdered Miyamoto's own Master, then fled into the Gobligan Empire. Miyamoto does not use a magical ship, but rather flies with his own two wings, and attacks via shuriken, ninjutsu stones, and other secret techniques.

		<name>Space Firebird</name>
		<desc>Space Firebird is a one or two player game in which players are attacked from all sides by highly maneuverable Firebirds. Players can move space ship left or right and shoot a rapid-fire laser at attacking Firebirds. A special Warp Mode allows the space ship to escape danger and fire at the flock of aliens.

FIREBIRDS
The space Firebirds are a unique set of adversaries. There are three different birds, the Emperor, Eagle and Gull, which fly together in complex looping formations, firing and attacking from all directions. The player must keep track of the laser hits because each bird has a different resistance level to hits. The fearless Emperor is destroyed by four hits, the Eagle with two hits and the soaring Gull with one hit. The Eagle also has a deadly bomb which is launched at the space ship. Extra points are scored by hitting the bomb before it explodes. The bomb when hit, scatters into deadly shrapnel. To avoid the flying shrapnel, the bomb must be hit from directly underneath.

SPACE SHIP
The space ship can be moved right or left to evade attacking Firebirds. Depressing the fire button enables the space ship to shoot its laser at approaching Firebirds. Players receive 3 (adjustable) space ships per play.

WARP MODE
Activate warp mode to escape impeding danger or to strike out at approaching birds. There is only warp mode per space ship. When activated, the space ship is launched into space with a force field around it that deflects enemy fire. In warp mode, Firebirds can be eliminated by ramming into them or by firing at close range.

If all Firebirds are destroyed, the player moves into a new battle sequence that increases in difficulty. One new space ship is awarded for a score of 5,000 (adjustable) points. Game ends when all space ships are destroyed.</desc>

		<desc>Space Fury is a rather simple alien blasting shoot-em-up. It uses almost industry standard vector controls, which are four buttons, Left Rotate, Right Rotate, Thrust, and Fire. You begin the game in the center of four strange looking shapes. These shapes are both level selects and upgrades. Run into one of them and it will add itself to your ship, and then you get to do the level associated with it. Each level is different mainly because you have wildly different shot patterns on each one. But all of them are the same when it comes to your objective. What you have to do is blast all the spaceship parts before they can form into dangerous enemy spaceships. Blast them all, and you get to select a new level and watch a little interlude where the alien taunts you with his evil computer voice.

		<desc>Space Harrier is a sprite-scaling 3D shoot-em-up set in the 'Fantasy Zone'; a surreal world composed of abstract structures and a checkerboard landscape. The game's enemies are as abstract as its setting; with creatures including prehistoric Mammoths, alien pods, giant mushrooms and, at the end of most stages, a huge, fireball-spitting Chinese Dragon.

The player's on-screen counterpart carries a portable jetpack under his arm which allows him to fly. The player can also run along the ground to avoid overhead structures and enemies.

In addition to its flight capability, the jetpack is also equipped with a laser, used to destroy both the game's many enemies as well as some (but not all) obstructions, such as the trees and floating rocks on the first stage.

Space Harrier has a total of 18 stages, each with a boss fight at the end. Three exceptions are the bonus stages (5th and 12th) and the 18th stage, which is a 'boss rush' featuring some of the bosses encountered up to that point.</desc>

Residents of Mesquite, Texas, pushed the issue all the way to the Supreme Court in their efforts to ban the illicit machines from their Bible-belt community. A number of reported incidents of juvenile crime began to surface shortly after the game's release, adding to its 'controversy'. A girl was caught stealing $5,000 from her parents and gangs of youths were reported to have robbed grocery stores just so they would have money to play the game.

There are now 3 different game modes to choose from. These include a faithful recreation of the legendary original - available in both upright and cocktail versions - and replete with a simulation of the infamous "coloured plastic overlay" that was used to add the impression of full colour graphics to the original game.

The 2 remaining game modes are 'Versus', with simultaneous split-screen 2-player action, and "Parody", which features characters and graphics from other well-known Taito games, such as "The New Zealand Story", "Bubble Bobble" and "Liquid Kids". Despite the graphical changes, the Parody version plays identically to the original game, and all modes retain the original, legendary sound effects.</desc>

Space Panic lacks Donkey Kong's jump mechanic - the main character instead digs holes in the platforms into which he must lure the aliens. He must then hit them to knock them out of the hole and off the screen. In later levels, two or more holes must be lined up vertically in order to dispose of the aliens. There is also a limited supply of oxygen.</desc>

		<desc>S.C.I. - Special Criminal Investigation is  a direct sequel to 1988's "Chase H.Q.", S.C.I. once again puts the player in charge of an unmarked police car - this time a Nissan 300ZX T-Top Turbo - in which the player must chase and capture a criminal mastermind before the time limit expires. Graphically, S.C.I. is very similar to its predecessor, although there are slight improvements with both a better use of colour and the introduction of some new weather effects; such as the rain on the first stage. Unlike the first game, the player is armed with a gun; this is used to take out criminals and roadblocks as the player races against the time limit, and also to capture the criminal mastermind and make an arrest before the time limit expires.</desc>

		<desc>In Spelunker - which means 'cave-diver' - a caver has to work his way down through a number of multi-directionally scrolling caves - each one deeper underground than the last - in his bid to find the mythical 'World of Wonders'. To do this, the spelunker must find the exit to each cave, so he can move on to the next and get closer to his goal.

Spelunker is a platform game, and each tricky cave is filled with enemies - such as bats and ogres - and traps. Ladders, ropes, lifts and the obligatory minecarts must be used to reach other platforms and sections of the cave.

To aid him in his difficult quest, the Spelunker carries a gun and can shoot short-range fireballs at his enemies to stun or kill them. Numerous bonus items can be collected, such as bombs to destroy any rocks block his route, keys to open locked doors and potions to boost the caver's ever-decreasing energy meter. Treasure chests also litter each cave, and can be opened for bonus treasure items.</desc>

There are several weapons to acquire, ranging from a yo-yo (the standard weapon) to bombs, icicles, missiles and more. Weapons differ in range, shooting frequency, and power, and can be shot in all directions. Each weapon also has a unique chargeable attack as well as a super-attack (which uses up one bomb-symbol).

It is also possible to jump on enemies or perform a sliding attack.</desc>

		<desc>In this game you control a race car on a semi-circular track. You are looking down on the action from above. Your only goal is to drive around the track as many times as possible, and as fast as you can. There will be four cars on the track at all times (the computer lets you know that 'Grey cars drive automatically').You control the white car, while the computer controls a black car and two grey cars. The game will rate you at the end, you can get rated Granny, Rookie, or Pro, and getting a score over 250 points will extend the game an extra 30 seconds. The game has several different tracks available, and they change randomly throughout the game (they literally change while you are still driving). This is different than the original "Sprint 2", which allowed you to select your track manually. The graphics are simple black and white with two shades of gray thrown in for good measure. They are simple, but they get the job done.</desc>

The object of the game is to travel the freeways and waterways, hunting down and destroying as many enemy vehicles as possible, all the while not harming civilian vehicles. The view is top-down and the screen scrolls vertically underneath the player's car.

The game begins with the player driving the G-6155. Soon, the player starts to encounter enemy vehicles which try to force the player's car off the road and crash. Each enemy vehicle has its own special feature, such as tire slashers or bulletproof armor.

Points are scored for driving on the road and for destroying enemy vehicles. There is a lead-in time when the player has an endless supply of cars. After this time expires, the player will lose a life each time the car crashes. Extra cars can be earned with high scores. The first extra car is earned at a default value of 30,000 points, but this value can vary depending on settings.

		<name>Star Castle</name>
		<desc>Star Castle is a 1- or 2-player outer space action game designed with features geared for maximum player appeal: A progressively difficult competitive level and a clearly defined enemy which must be both attacked and avoided at various points in the course of play.

The center of the playfield is occupied by the Star Castle which is programmed to constantly home in on the players' ships. Surrounding the Star Castle are three concentric energy rings of twelve segments each, which serve as both a protective perimeter for the Star Castle and a source of points for the player. Contained within the energy rings are three protective mines which seek out the players' ships and destroy them upon collision. The movements of the mines are programmed to simulate the actions of heat-seeking missiles.

The object of the games of Star Castle is to score the maximum number of points possible. This is accomplished by the combination of three elements:
a) Exploding the ring segments.
b) Exploding the Star Castle.
c) Avoiding the Star Castle's mines. A player's turn is over when his ship has been destroyed. The number of ships per game is set by the operator.

For maximum scoring, a player will want to shoot out sections of the energy rings in order to give him a shot at the Star Castle in the center of the screen. As play progresses, there are 2 facts a player must keep in mind:
1) Exploding all segments in a given ring will cause the entire ring to reappear - thereby eliminating a potential shot at the Star Castle in the center.
2) Exploding the rings in a manner that gives you a shot at the Star Castle will also give the Star Castle a shot at you. The Star Castle is programmed so that its nose always seeks out the player's ship. If there is an open shot at the player, it will take it.

When the Star Castle is hit by a player's missile, it will first implode and then explode with all remaining ring segments. After a one-second delay, the Star Castle will reappear with all three ring segments. If the Star Castle shoots the player, his turn is over.

As play begins, the Star Castle will appear in the center of the screen surrounded by its 3 energy rings. The player's ship appears about halfway up on the right hand edge. By using the control buttons to move forward, right or left, the player maneuvers about the screen using the firing button to launch missiles.

Points are scored by destroying the energy ring segments or the Star Castle itself. Exploding the Star Castle gives an extra ship as well as points. No points are given for the mines that attack the player.

The player's ship can be destroyed in 2 ways: By collision with the mines or by a hit from the Star Castle's torpedo. The mines are launched from the rings and attack the player for approximately ten seconds or until shot. The Star Castle's torpedoes are launched only when there is a clear shot at the player through all 3 rings. At this time the player also has his shot at the Star Castle. Both the Star Castle and the mines get smarter and faster as the game progresses.

The game of STAR CASTLE is not based on time units. The battle rages on until all the players' ships are destroyed. The length of the game depends solely on the skill of the player. It's the age-old challenge of man versus machine.</desc>

		<desc>Star Force is a single-player, vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up in which the player pilots a spaceship called the 'Final Star' over series series of islands floating in outer-space space and must destroy waves of enemy spacecraft and ground-based targets. 

Special symbols appear at regular intervals that can be shot or collected for bonuses and power-ups. The Final Star is only equipped with forward-firing guns but these can be upgraded occasionally by collecting the relevant power-up. This resembles a small space ship and doubles the length of the Final Star, while also increasing its fire-power. 

The stages in Star Force are designated by letters of the Greek alphabet and each has an end-of-level guardian in the form of a Greek letter that must be defeated to progress to the next level. The guardian moves down the screen and if the player fails to destroy it before it disappears from view, they will have a play a little more of the level in order to reach the guardian again.</desc>

		<desc>Star Jacker is an early vertical scrolling shooter with some interesting characteristics.  The player starts out with three fighters with all of the fighters moving and shooting at the same time. Two fighters trail the lead fighter. Star Jacker features a similar scheme with the Namco game Xevious in that the fighters shoot at enemy fighters in the air while dropping bombs on enemies and targets on the ground level.

When any of the fighters is killed, the game momentarily pauses and re-centers the player fighters before continuing at the same point.  The game is over when all of the player's fighters are destroyed. Star Jacker allows no continues.</desc>

		<desc>Stargate, also known as 'Defender II', will transport you to a whole new dimension in video games! Not only will the skills you learned with "Defender" be challenged and refined, but new strategies must come into play if you are to be victorious in rescuing the humanoids from the clutches of the aliens and in entering the Stargate! Your ability to react quickly and with on-target precision will be tested against the evil Yllabian Space Guppies, Dynamos, Space Hums, Firebombers and their Fireballs, Phreds, Big Reds and Munchies! If you succeed in maneuvering your ship into the Stargate, you'll be instantly trans-located to that part of the planet where the humanoids are being abducted! To open up spectacular scoring possibilities, rescue four Humanoids, re-enter Stargate and you'll warp 3 waves ahead in space and time, setting off dazzling special effects and racking up high points! 

If you must destroy everything in your path or risk self-destruction, activate the Inviso anti-matter cloaking device and become invisible and invulnerable! Inviso time plus a new ship and a Smart Bomb are earned with every 10,000 points you score! 

If all ten Humanoids in a wave are abducted, the universe will explode into smithereens, leaving deadly Mutants on the attack! Survive until Wave 5 and the universe will be restored, the humanoids safe... but you'll be the target of an Yllabian Dog Fight! There'll be no Landers to abduct the Humanoids, but all the other aliens will have stronger and larger forces concentrated against you! It will be an out space battle reaching the outer limits of aggression and will call up your last ounce of determination and courage!</desc>

		<desc>Street Fighter II' - Hyper Fighting is the second SFII follow-up. Here's what's new: 
Gameplay is SIGNIFICANTLY sped up to intensify the pace of the game. 
More special moves (ie. Chun Li's fireball, Dhalsim's Yoga Teleport) are added for each character except for M. Bison. 
New color schemes are added for each character (but the color schemes for the stage backgrounds are still the same as they were for Champion Edition). 
The addition of mid-air special moves for Chun Li, Ryu and Ken are introduced. 
Platform graphics (resembling the medal ceremonies in the Olympics) are added to each character's ending, featuring the character you completed the game with at the first-place platform, M. Bison at the second-place platform, and Sagat at the third-place platform. The musical setting for this display is the music from the home stage of the character standing on the 1st-place platform (If you completed the game with Sagat or M. Bison, the one you used stands on the 1st-place platform, the other one on the 2nd-place platform, and Vega occupies the 3rd-place platform).</desc>

The new moves available for each fighter, called Super moves, allow them to fire off very powerful moves. A bar at the bottom of the screen represents the power that you have to use for the moves. You start the first round on 0, and each attack that you make adds power to the bar. Once you reach level 3, you can unleash the special attacks, that can sometimes KO the opponant.

The other major change over the Street Fighter 2 series are the Alpha counters. These can be used to counter an on-coming attack after blocking.</desc>

		<desc>Strike Force is a side-scrolling shoot-em-up and is the third game in Midway's seminal "Defender" series. Saurian lizard men have overrun all twenty-two planets that form the New Earth Solar System colonies, capturing and mutating the resident humans into reptiles to use as slave labour at their stronghold base, the Saurian 'Mega-Star Apocalypse'.

Players fly a spaceship over the surface of the of planets, destroying enemy waves and rescuing humans from the alien invaders, with rescued humans hanging from the underside of the player's ship. Once these tasks have been completed, the mothership arrives to pick up the player's ship, together with any humans they have rescued. Players can decide which planets to attack, when to purchase additional firepower and when to attack the Apocalypse.

Strike Force adds several new features to the series. Two players can now share the screen at one time and the surface of each planet is littered with various special weapons that can be picked up and deployed. Humans can be 'mutated' into small green creatures that will fight against the player (although players can still pick them up for points as, with the unmutated humans). The mutants can also use vehicles found on the planet's surface against the player.</desc>

		<desc>In 1945, the second world war ended. Soon, there was peace, but an organization of high-ranking military officers from all over the world form a global army known as CANY. Their mission was to conquer the world. CANY activity was found in areas like the Soviet Union, America, Japan, and even Germany. It is revealed that CANY had weapons never seen before from rockets to mechanical walkers. The world quickly formed a group of pilots and planes called the Strikers whose mission is to rid of CANY from the world.</desc>

However, a small group known as the FGR stole the sources and technology responsible for the last events and planned to continue CANYs work by initiating world-warfare with massive mech technology. Once again, the Strikers are called into action.</desc>

		<desc>The player chooses one of six planes or can opt for a random choice. The first four stages are in random order, while the last four are sequential. Players collect weapon powerups, bombs, and gold bars for points. Each plane has a unique "supershot" which is charged by damaging enemies and fired by holding then releasing the fire button. Supershots can be stored, although the number varies from plane to plane. Using a bomb results in a large friendly fighter swooping onto the screen and blocking shots while returning fire for a few seconds.

After the player beats the final boss, the game starts again from the beginning, albeit at a much higher difficulty level. All level are similar to the ones in Strikers 1945 II. Only one of the four bosses that are randomly chosen and the sixth boss is changed.</desc>

When one of Joe's old rivals, Rikishi, died in the ring in 1970, Kodansha publishing actually held a funeral service for him. Over 700 people attended from all over Japan. An actual Buddhist priest presided over the funeral, held in a full-sized boxing ring.</desc>

		<name>Sunset Riders</name>
		<desc>Sunset Riders is a horizontally-scrolling platform shoot-em-up for up to four players set in America's Wild West. Four sharpshooter bounty hunters (Steve, Billy, Bob and Cormano) set out to claim the bounties for killing the most wanted outlaws in the West, before a final showdown against the infamous Sir Richard de la Rose.

The action takes place both on foot and on horseback, with play sometimes broken up with a wild west pursuit; such as having to run along the backs of a herd of fleeing Buffalo. Each level ends with players entering a one-on-one battle against one of the wanted men they have been pursuing. 

Power-ups and bonus items can be obtained by entering saloons or defeating certain sack-carrying bandits. The power-ups comes in the form of either a golden sheriff badge (that gives the player's weapon auto-fire) or a silver badge that gives the player a second gun (making it possible to shoot in two directions simultaneously). Both power-ups can be equipped at the same time. 

Other weapons that can be used by players include sticks of dynamite carried by female bandits that can be thrown back at the enemy before they explode and a mounted Gatling gun available only in the last stage. 

A bonus mini-game appears at the end of Stages 2 and 5 in which players must shoot at enemies from a first-person perspective before the timer runs out.

Sunset Riders features eight stages of play.</desc>

		<name>Super Breakout</name>
		<desc>Super Breakout allows the player(s) to select any one of three different action-packed Super Breakout games by turning the game select knob on the control panel to the desired game. The three available Super Breakout modes are the following: 

Double Breakout: before serving the ball, the Double Breakout playfield contains 52 orange bricks (4x13) at the top of the screen and 52 green bricks (4x13) immediately below the orange brick wall. 
Two paddles are displayed at the bottom end of the screen. When the Serve pushbutton is pressed, two balls are served. If the first ball served is missed, it counts as a missed serve and goes against the player's allotted serves per game. Otherwise the second ball is served. If the second ball served is missed after striking the first served ball, the player may continue with the first ball. 

Cavity Breakout: before serving the ball, the Cavity Breakout playfield contains 44 orange bricks and 52 (4x13) green bricks located immediately below the orange brick wall. At approximately 3 columns in and 2 rows down into the orange brick wall, from both the left and the right side of the wall, two cavities appear. These two cavities occupy the space of 4 bricks (a 2x2 brick area).
One paddle is provided in this game, and only one ball is served, unlike in Double Breakout. When enough bricks are removed to release a captive ball from its cavity, the score doubles for each brick removed by any of the two balls in the playfield (as long as the served ball and the freed ball both remain active in the playfield). If the third ball is freed and all three balls are played in the playfield, the score triples. If any one of the balls is missed and lost, the score returns to double points. If the second ball is missed and only one ball remains in the playfield, points are then scored as normal. 

Progressive Breakout: before serving the ball, the Progressive Breakout playfield contains 4x13 brick walls (one blue and the other green). The blue brick wall, which consists of 52 bricks, is at the top. Then occurs a space equivalent to this wall. In the middle of the screen is a green brick wall consisting of 52 bricks. 
The brick walls move or 'scroll' toward the paddle at a rate determined by the number of hits on the ball. As the bricks are knocked out and the walls progressively creep up on the player's paddle, new bricks enter the playfield at a progressively faster rate. Four rows of bricks are always separated by four rows of blanks. 
As the brick walls scroll down, their colors change, indicating a new point score for that brick at that instant of time.</desc>

The object of the game is to invade ten SUPER COBRA defense systems of increasing difficulty and safely pick up the BOOTY.

Use the joystick to move up, down, accelerate and decelerate. Use the Laser and Bombs to destroy defenders. Hitting tanks scores Mystery Value worth 100, 200, or 300 points. Rockets, Tanks, Missiles, and UFO's may all fire at invader. Hit fuel tanks for extra fuel for CHOPPER. The Chopper uses up fuel as it flies, except in between defense levels.

At 10000 points, the player is awarded a BONUS CHOPPER.

At the end of the game, the player can continue at the defense level he left off on by depositing extra coins and pressing the discharge button on the left-hand side of the panel.

If the Booty is destroyed on the BASE level, the player may try again. When the Booty is safely recovered, a Bonus Chopper is awarded and play resumes at defense level Number 1 where the fuel is used up faster and the defenders fire more often.

SUPER COBRA Defense Level Descriptions:
 Fuel Tanks appear on every defense level.
 Tanks appear and fire on all levels except level 8 where they do not fire.
Level 1 - Player must maneuver the chopper over mountainous terrain against fast and slow firing rockets.

This time around the teams are all formed by characters from the Nekketsu Kunio Kun universe, each representing different suburbs of Tokyo that compete in an amusement park for the ultimate title. Each character has their unique stats and special moves, which now depend on a power bar that can be charged-up by holding both attack buttons.</desc>

		<name>Super Hang-On</name>
		<desc>Super Hang-On is a checkpoint-based racing game and is the sequel to the acclaimed "Hang-On", released two years earlier. As with the prequel, players take control of a superbike and must race over twisting road-based circuits, avoiding rival bikers and trying to reach the end-of-stage checkpoint before the time limit expires.

For the sequel, Sega introduced the hilly, undulating roads that had been executed so superbly in 1986's "Out Run". The gameplay was further enhanced with the introduction of the 'turbo' button. Upon reaching the bike's maximum speed of 280kph, players could press and hold the turbo and push the bike up to 324kph - something that was necessary to beat the game's extremely tight time limits. This had to be used carefully, however, as the increase in speed made the bike harder to control and accelerating at the wrong time would invariably see a head-on collision with either rival bikers or the road-side objects that litter the stages.

Players could chose to race on any one of four courses: Africa, Asia, America and Europe. Africa is the easiest and shortest of the four, with each subsequent course becoming both more demanding - with tighter bends and more aggressive rival racers - and having a greater number of stages to have to beat. Africa, for example, is made up of only six stages, while the hardest course, Europe, has eighteen stages.</desc>

		<name>Super Pac-Man</name>
		<desc>Super Pac-Man is a 1- or 2-player game where you are in control of the legendary Pac-Man. As in the original "Pac-Man" game, the goal is to clear each maze, but this time, instead of dots, the maze consists of prizes which are locked away behind gates. There are two ways to access the prizes. You can eat the keys which open a particular gate, and not always the gate which is closest to that key. Or you can crash through the gate after you eat a Super Pill and become Super Pac-Man. You are not required to eat all of the keys in order to complete the stage. 

Four Power Pills are in maze and allow Pac-Man to turn the tables on the ghosts and eat them for a short time. When the ghosts begin to flash, time is running out and they will switch back, so beware. 

New in this game is the Super Pill. There are two Super Pills in the maze which allow Pac-Man to become Super Pac-Man for a limited period of time. While in Super form, Pac-Man can crash through the maze gates, fly over the ghosts and avoid being killed (or eat them when they're blue), and travel at super speed whenever the player presses and holds the Super Speed button. When the super power is about to run out, Pac-Man flashes white and then returns to his normal form. You can extend the duration of Super time by eating a regular Power Pill. The Super time will then be extended by the duration of the ghosts' blue time. 

Pac-Man loses one life whenever a ghost catches him when the ghost is not blue and Pac-Man is not in Super form. You start with a set number of lives ('Lives' dip switch), and bonus lives can be awarded to you as you reach or pass certain preselected point values ('Extra Lives' dip switch). 

The tunnel is a great way to put some space between you and any ghosts that are on your tail since they can only move half as fast as you when they are in it. In Super Pac-Man, the ghosts are also slowed down by travelling through the passage directly beneath the ghost pen.

Occasionally, a star will appear in the middle of the screen with a picture on the left, and a rotating picture on the right. You may eat the star at any time for bonus points, but if you manage to eat the star when the right picture matches the left one, you will receive a larger bonus. 

As the stages increases, the ghosts speed up their pursuit of Pac-Man and they stay blue for shorter and shorter periods of time after he eats a Power Pill until, in the high stages, they do not turn blue at all. 

Super Pac-Man also features bonus stages in Stage 3, Stage 7, and every fourth stage thereafter, where there are no ghosts, a time limit, and Pac-Man is in Super form throughout the stage. Your goal is to eat all of the prizes in the given time limit. As with gameplay on the regular levels, you don't need to eat all (or any) of the keys. You are awarded the remaining time in the counter as points for successfully eating everything. With each Bonus stage, the walls and gates change color.

		<name>Super Pang</name>
		<desc>Super Bang is a sequel to the 1989 original in which one or two players control characters armed with harpoon guns who must destroy the numerous different-sized balloons that bounce around each single-screen stage. When hit by a harpoon, the balloons break down into smaller fragments, in a similar fashion to Atari's 1979 classic, "Asteroids". 

Players can only fire the harpoon guns virtually upwards but can move left and right and climb the ladders that appear on many of the stages. The game has two different modes of play:

PANIC MODE
In this mode, players face an endless rain of bubbles and must simply last as long as possible. The default weapon is the bubble shot and cannot be changed at any time. Each time a bubble is popped, a rainbow bar at the bottom is slowly filled. Filling the bar all the way raises the level number and the bar depletes back to zero. As more bubbles are popped, both remaining and incoming bubbles move faster. A 'Panic' music plays when there's a very large amount of bubbles on the screen, but the normal music returns once enough bubbles are popped.

There is also one special type of bubble that appears rarely. The bubble has a clock image engraved. Whenever the bubble bounces, the engraving changes to a star, and when the bubble bounces again, the engraving changes back to a clock. Popping the bubble when the clock engraving is present causes all bubbles to stop movement completely for 9 seconds, while popping the bubble when the star engraving is present causes all bubbles to be popped and the game screen gets cleared.

TOUR MODE
In this mode players move from stage to stage, travelling around the world. The introductory stage is set in Japan and is the only stage set in this location. After Japan, players travel to parts of Asia, Europe and the Americas. Each location has three stages, with each set at a different time of day: daytime, evening and night. The few exceptions to the three-stage rule are Venice (evening and night stages only), The Mayan Ruins and the Caribbean Sea (both having only day and evening stages).

Each stage has a set layout, consisting of walls, destructible glass walls, invisible walls, ladders and ice. There are forty different stages in the Tour mode.</desc>

		<name>Super Pinball Action</name>
		<desc>A pinball game featuring 4 boards:  On the Carnival Board, there are two ways to work towards the goal: knocking out the drop targets on the upper board, or hitting the button targets that light the word 'Rhythm' on the lower part of the main board.  On the Border Board, the 'INPUT' button targets in the center upper part of the board are the ones to hit to work your way towards your goal.  On the Monster Board, you must complete 7 different target areas, each one referring to a body part: 2 roll-throughs for arms, two holes for eyes, two sets of targets for legs and the top rollovers work towards the 'head'.  On the Sniper Board, you knock down the 'LOAD' drop targets, then shoot the Shot Bonus button target when lit. You do this 6 times to reach your goal.    As you go follow through on the game, the warp shots let you see how far you've gone in your quest to finish each board. The fewer clothes each girl has, the further you have gone on that board. Once the women are topless, you've done all you can on that board.</desc>

		<name>Super Punch-Out!!</name>
		<desc>Super Punch-Out!! is an update of the superb boxing game, "Punch-Out!!", featuring five new larger-than-life opponents. The player once again assumes the role of a green-haired boxer who must fight his way up through five boxers to earn the title of 'Champ'. 

As with the original game, the player's boxer is viewed from behind with his torso rendered with wire-frame graphics (allowing the player's opponent to be easily seen). Punches, dodges and blocks must all be well-timed in order to defeat the opponent. 

Both the player and the opponent have stamina meters displayed at the top of the screen. These decrease when either boxer takes a punch and boxers will get knocked down if their stamina meter runs out completely. Faster knockdowns will cause the fallen boxer to recover less stamina upon getting up; the same happens if a boxer is knocked down by a knockout punch. 

Thanks to the refined roster of new and hugely distinctive enemy fighters, Super Punch-Out!! is considered to be an improvement over the first game.</desc>

		<desc>SRD: Super Real Darwin is a vertical scrolling shooter arcade game developed and published by Data East. It is the sequel to Data East's 1986 arcade game, Darwin 4078. The player takes control of a small fighter ship capable of mutating into different shapes. The ship's appearance will change with upgraded weapons as the player obtains more powerups.

The story starts on the planet Lakya where the technologically advanced inhabitants of the planet unwittingly unleash the planet's life force known as Evol. As the released Evol drifts from planet Lakya, it is received by the inhabitants of the nearby planet Cokyo; the people of Cokyo initiate the Shlohe project, a plan to use their captured Evol to develop advanced biologic ships and weapons to invade planet Lakya. The inhabitants of Lakya retaliate the Cokyo invasion by using their own evolving fighter ships.</desc>

After beating it, your team goes into the World (Cup) Tournament, in which you are grouped with three other countries in a round-robin. After winning against all of them, you go into an elimination tournament: the quarterfinals, semifinals, and the final for the World Cup. This type of tournament thus is more reminiscent of the real-life World Cup. If a match ends in a draw, you also have the option of replaying a full game, go to the penalty kick tiebreaker, or play a sudden death game.</desc>

		<name>Super Space Invaders '91</name>
		<desc>Export versionof "Majestic Twelve - The Space Invaders Part IV".
The third sequel to Taito's seminal "Space Invaders", Majestic Twelve leaves the classic Invaders game-play intact, but adds a slew of new alien invaders and power-ups to the mix. This, together with the vastly improved graphics that introduce colorful new backdrops - some of which scroll vertically in a similar fashion to the star-field in Namco's "Galaxian" - ensure that Majestic 12 is a worthy sequel to the legendary original.

The original game's flying saucer still makes an appearance, but instead of merely awarding bonus points when shot - as in the original game - it now drops a power-up pod for the player to retrieve. Power-ups include shield, faster shots, a laser (activated with the second button) and a giant butterfly, which freezes the invaders for a limited time.

One of the game's most memorable features was the 'Cattle Mutilation' bonus screen, in which the player must protect a heard of cattle from a number of fast-moving saucers, intent on stealing the animals. If a cow is snatched; the player must shoot the relevant saucer to free it; being careful not to actually shoot the cow itself. The '91 incarnation also introduced 'bosses' to the series for the first time; giant, screen-filling aliens that required several shots to kill.

Another major difference to the previous games in the series is that if an invader reaches the bottom of the screen, the player will simply lose a ship (in the original, the game would end once an alien had landed). Also, the player's ship now comes equipped with a shield that can withstand several hits. The shield's strength is depleted every time it takes a direct hit from one of the invaders, and too many hits will result in the shield disappearing altogether. A direct hit on an un-shielded ship will result in the loss of a player life.</desc>

		<desc>TAC/SCAN is a one or two-player vector-based shoot-em-up in which players control a formation squadron of seven fighter ships. All seven ships fire at once when the FIRE button is pressed, producing a spectacular missile salvo.

The player begins the game with a seven ship formation and a supply of reserve ships (shown above the player score). The object of the game is to accumulate points by destroying enemy ships while avoiding incoming fire. As well as the main squadron, there are a number of reserve ships and an ADD SHIP button. This transfers one of the reserve ships into the squadron formation. The 'add ship' position continuously cycles between the empty squadron positions, allowing players to time the ADD SHIP function to place fighters at their desired location.</desc>

		<desc>At its core, Tactician might seem like another Space Invaders / Galaxian clone - you control a small ship at the bottom of the screen, which can actually move up or down a bit, instead of just left and right - but it has a pretty cool gimmick going for it. 

At the beginning of each stage, you can "draw" a barrier by placing little dots around the playing field. After several seconds, enemies are released from their bases and begin to swarm the screen. They'll usually make quick work of the barrier, but if you shoot the red ball it'll explode and destroy anything near it. Quite a cool concept for something from 1981 - it's a shame that Tactician is so unknown, and that the idea was never expanded on in any other games. Some versions list the game as copyrighted by Sega, but they apparently only distributed the game in certain territories.</desc>

The players' characters are armed with a magic wand, which can be used to both destroy and create blocks to use as platforms and barriers. Players can remove platform blocks directly above their characters' heads by repeatedly jumping up into them until they break.

To complete a level, players must collect all of the circle/diamond items that litter each screen. Once all of these have been collected, a door will appear through which the player must exit to complete the level.</desc>

		<name>Terra Cresta</name>
		<desc>Terra Cresta is a vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up set over a constantly scrolling landscape of islands and enemy installations. The player is under constant attack from enemy spaceship waves, ground-based guns and turrets, dinosaurs and three different mothercraft ships. 

The levels are littered with ground-based silos bearing numbers between 2 and 5. These can be shot to release a player ship component, which then attaches to the player's current ship, increasing both its size and firepower. Power-ups available are 2-Wide shot, 3-Rear Shot, 4-Front cannon and 5-Rear shield. 

Using the 'Formation' button splits the ship parts into a formation for limited time, giving increased fire power. The number of parts acquired determines the formation. For example, if the player has picked up two ship parts then a triangle is formed, with the player's main ship at the rear of the formation, with additional two ship components positioned at the front edge of the triangle. 

When all four numbered parts have been collected, the player's ship transforms into a flaming Phoenix, and is indestructible for a limited time.</desc>

Homing torpedoes, Polaris missiles, mines, Stingray style vessels and other boat-wrecking hazards make up the threats to avoid or destroy. Bonus capsules which float up to the surface boost the boat's speed, increase depth charge power, give the player temporary invincibility and other normal features but of a marine vein. The depth charges take their time to float to their target so plan ahead using the map, submarines at different heights in the water pose further problems. This game also has good backgrounds.</desc>

		<name>The Empire Strikes Back</name>
		<desc>The third arcade outing based on the legendary trilogy of films; "Empire Strikes Back" eschews Jedi's Zaxxon-inspired gameplay and returns once more to the 3D vector graphics of the first game. Empire features four stages of play, with the first two putting the player in control "Luke Skywalker's" SnowSpeeder, and the second two in control of "Han Solo's" Millennium Falcon.    The first level, Probots, takes place on the ice planet of Hoth, with the player flying the Snowspeeder over the planet's surface to find and destroy the Empire's search droids that are sending signals to the Empire warning them of the rebels' presence.  The second Snowspeeder stage sees the player taking on the Empire's "AT-AT" Imperial walkers, as well as a number of smaller, bi-pedal "AT-ST" walkers. On this level, as well as the standard guns, the Snowspeeder is armed with a limited number of harpoons; these can be fired at the AT-AT's legs to send them crashing to the ground. AT-ATs can also be destroyed by shooting a small, highlighted area on the AT-ATs' head.  The third level has the player piloting the Millennium Falcon and is a repeat of the original game's in-space Tie Fighter battle.  For the fourth and final level the player must pilot the Millennium Falcon safely through a densely packed and fast-moving asteroid field.    Bonus points can be earned by destroying a certain number of targets. A JEDI letter will also be awarded in addition to the bonus points. Once all the letters that spell the word 'JEDI' have been awarded, players will have attained true JEDI FORCE, making them invincible to the Empire's forces for a limited amount of time.    In all levels of play, collisions with objects and enemy shots will cause damage to the player's deflector shields.</desc>

In 'The End' you control a ship whose mission is to zap as many bug-ships as possible, before you run out of lives, or the bugs manage to spell out the word END with little chunks of brick. You can move left and right, and the bugs attack from the top of the screen, coming out of a large mothership. But the bugs have another mission besides just blindly attacking you. That other mission is to systematically steal the bricks from your three bases, and use them to spell out the word END up near the top of the screen.</desc>

		<name>The Great Ragtime Show</name>
		<desc>A superbly playable, humourous and utterly unique shoot-em-up from the Date East stable. The player begins each life in control of a bi-plane with a huge metal hook attached to its rear. This hook can be used to pick up enemies, objects, bombs and vehicles which can then be thrown both at other enemies, and at any walls and doorways that may be barring the player's route.

If the bi-plane takes two hits from enemy forces, it will explode and the player is forced to continue on foot. The on-foot sections play in a vaguely similar fashion to SNK's legendary "Metal Slug" series, but while on foot, the player has no protection from enemy hits and is very vulnerable to attack. As such, a replacement vehicle (which appear in the form of tanks, motorbikes, giant robots, elephants etc.) must be found quickly.

Boogie Wings features highly detailed and completely destructible scenery, with a multitude of background animations making the game feel 'alive' and giving it much of its distinctive character. The game's settings are as original as its gameplay; with museums, fairgrounds, the inside of skyscrapers etc. all making an appearance. Boogie Wings soundtrack is also unique to the genre, with a mixture of well-known jazz and blues tunes accompanying the frenetic on-screen action.</desc>

		<name>The Karate Tournament</name>
		<desc>Karate Tournament is a one-on-one fighting game for one or two players, based on the ancient and most well known of martial arts, Karate.

Players enter a karate tournament - having first selected their preferred skill level, from either White, Brown or Black belt - and fight against a number of progressively tougher opponents. Each victory awards the player with a higher belt grade within their current belt colour - white grade six to white grade five, for example - and if the player wins the tournament, he or she is awarded a higher belt colour and the game ends. If players chooses to play the game on the 'Black Belt' skill level, defeating opponents is awarded with a higher grade, or 'dan' of Black Belt.

Karate Tournament uses a distinctive graphical technique in that it 'morphs' some of the combatants' movement graphics to simulate speed and motion blur. The game was also unique upon its release in that, in a world of "Street Fighters" and "Mortal Kombats" - replete with fantastical special moves - Karate Tournament was a genuine simulation of a recognized martial art; something not really seen since the first appearance of Data East's legendary genre-defining fighter, "Karate Champ", released eight years' earlier in 1984.</desc>

		<desc>The King of Dragons is a 1991 side-scrolling hack and slash video game by Capcom that allows players to choose from five characters (Elf, Wizard, Fighter, Cleric, and Dwarf) in order to travel through the kingdom of Malus and defeat the monsters that have taken over, as well as their leader, the red dragon Gildiss. Like Capcom's Knights of the Round, it features a level advancement system, allowing character attributes to be upgraded as players progress through the game. The setting is very similar to that of Dungeons &amp; Dragons and other medieval fantasy worlds, with familiar monsters such as Orcs, Gnolls, Harpies, Wyverns, Cyclopes, and Minotaurs.

The game was ported to the Super NES and released in 1994. An emulated version of the game was released as part of Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 2 and Capcom Classics Collection: Reloaded.</desc>

		<desc>The first sequel in the King of Fighters series picks up a year after the end of the first tournament. Once again, fighters from all over the world receive a mysterious invitation to a team-based fighting tournament. And just like last year, it appears that the notorious criminal Rugal Bernstein is behind it, apparently returning from the dead to raise havok once again...

The King of Fighters '95 introduces Kyo Kusanagi's rival Iori Yagami, and firmly places Kyo as the main character for the rest of the series. The gameplay of The King of Fighters '95 is essentially unchanged from the previous title, though it does introduce the "team edit" concept which would remain as a standard feature of the series. Using the "team edit" feature, it is possible to create a totally customized team using any of the available fighters, or use one of the default teams if you wish.</desc>

The storyline of the series receives heavy focus in this release with the Orochi Saga swinging into high-gear. Other features carried over from the previous year include the ability to choose between the default "Team Fighting" mode or the traditional "Single Fighter" style of gameplay, plus the "Versus" and "Survival" gameplay modes.</desc>

		<desc>Another year, another KOF. Additions this year come in the form of slightly improved graphics and sounds, new moves and a new game mode. Gameplay is much more plot-driven, as you have middle-bosses that can change depending on what team you select. In addition, there are several special endings which are only shown when certain "Edit Team" combinations are selected. New characters include the New Face Team, the Fatal Fury Outlaw Team (featuring the KOF debut of "Blue" Mary Ryan and Ryuji Yamazaki, and the return of Billy Kane), and Kyo's pupil Shingo Yabuki. In total, The King of Fighters '97 sports 29 separate characters.</desc>

This year's tournament is sponsored by the Ikari Warriors in an attempt to discover more about the NESTS organization, and to derail the plans of potential NESTS agents K' and Maxima. Not everything is as straight-forward as it usually is, however, and even the Ikari Warriors themselves are at risk of being betrayed from within by the end of the tournament.</desc>

The King of Fighters 2002 also has five characters exclusive to the X-Box, the PS2 and/or Dreamcast systems: Shingo Yabuki, King, Geese Howard, "Riot of the Blood" Iori and Leopold Goenitz. Shingo and King are available on all the non-Neo Geo systems, while Geese and the rest are only available on the PS2 and X-Box platforms.

The gameplay system has also changed. The striker system and four-character teams found in the last three KOF releases have been totally removed. In their place are the old-school three man teams and the "Advanced system" from The King of Fighters '97 and The King of Fighters '98.

		<desc>A jewel heist gone wrong sees Mr Burns's sidekick, Smithers, kidnapping Maggie and making his escape. Between one and four players take on the role of either Homer, Marge, Lisa, or Bart in this colorful, horizontally-scrolling beat-em-up from Konami. Each Simpsons character possesses an attacking move specific to them; Marge is armed with a vacuum cleaner, Lisa has a skipping rope, Bart has his skateboard, and Homer fights with his fists. The players must battle their way through a variety of Simpsons-themed levels - such as Springfield and Krustyland - fighting goons, thugs, zombies, drunks, firemen, and several Simpsons regulars. Many Simpsons characters that don't appear as enemies have 'cameo' scenes in the game (Otto working at a burgerstand in Krustyland, for example). The archetypal 'boss' character awaits the players at the end of every stage. The game ends with a final showdown with the evil Mr. Burns in his luxurious mansion.

The Simpsons was designed to Konami's typically-high production standards and was, like the 'Ninja Turtles' games that appeared a couple of years' earlier, very faithful to its source material. The colorful, smoothly-animated sprites captured the spirit of the legendary cartoon superbly, and the game's many humorous touches were timed to perfection.</desc>

You drive you car around the maze, picking up the money that is laying around everywhere (just like the dots in "Pac-Man"). Now to avoid being any more like" Pac-Man", the designer decided to give you four enemies, who each move around the maze with a distinct personality (but they are cars, not ghosts). In a final attempt to make this game different from "Pac-man", the designer then added dollar signs in each corner of the screen, running over these allows you to chase after your foes, and run over them (not at all like "Pac-Man"). In later levels these dollar signs may be in places other than the corners (finally, something that actually is different than "Pac-Man"). Each level is finished by clearing all the dollars bills from the board (the game will also rate you with a new 'Crime Level' every time you complete a screen).</desc>

		<desc>Thrash Rally is a fast-paced racing game, similar to Neo Drift Out and Overtop, but using a top-down view. You can either participate in a World Championship or do a complete Paris Dakar rally.
Using basic controls: accelerate with automatic transmission, brake and a combination of both to power drift, you have to follow a set path of courses. In the World Championship, each location consists of different stages that need to be finished in a single run. There is a strict time limit and you receive a time bonus upon finishing a section. The Dakar mode is one long track without stops. The championship uses regular cars, but in the Dakar race you can also choose a sand buggy, off-road bike or a truck.

A global ranking is kept while racing, but it is based on your time, not on the number of cars you pass during the race. Aside from your opponents, you'll also find water, animals, hills, bridges, bushes and different obstacles in your path.</desc>

His sprite is like an enlarged version of his sprites from Midnight Wanderers, he shares the same position stance, his trademark jump in which he holds his hand on his hat, and also the same shooting animation. The sprites are recoloured in a more vibrant cartoon-esque style, as opposed to the washed out effect from the games, to match the style of the Marvel vs Capcom series. If two players get Lou, then the second player's pallette is Green, and is most likely based on Siva's color clothing from the Midnight Wanderers game. Player two's firestorm is colored orange.

Lou's Companion Siva, has a character based on him as a tribute, featuring on Capcom's Cannon Spike game. The character is called Shiba Shintaro.</desc>

Thunder Blade consists of four stages, which are as follows:
Stage 1: The game begins in a skyscraper-packed city. Enemies consist of rival choppers, jets, and ground-based tanks and gun emplacements. The level ends over the sea, with the player facing a huge and heavily-armed battleship. 
Stage 2: This stage begins with the player navigating a desert canyon, before switching to the into-the-screen view and taking the player through a number of stalactite-packed and densely populated caves. A huge ground-based tank awaits the player at the end of the stage.
Stage 3: This begins in a river canyon, before moving on to a rain-forest river network. As well the the usual line-up of enemies, heavily-armed boats are introduced. the end-of-level battle takes place in the skies as the player attempts to destroy a massive jet fighter.
Stage 4: The 4th and final stage begins with a repeat of the first stage's city level, only this time the action takes place at night. The second half of this stage takes the player deep into an industrial complex, eventually leading to an end-of-game showdown with a massive and heavily-armed gun emplacement.</desc>

		<name>Thunder Cross II</name>
		<desc>Taking place in the future of space colonization, the planet Haniamu IV is under attack from a relentless, unknown military force known only as Black Impulse. The strongest Earth ships capable of stopping the total conquering of the planet are the Blue Thunder M-45 (player 1) and the Red Thunder M-24 (player 2).

Thunder Cross is a classic horizontal shooter with 7 stages. Players control the Thunder fighter with up to four "options", which arrange up and down vertically and add to the player's attack power. Three weapons are selectable ranging from the Vulcan shot to the Laser and the Boomerang shot (which doubles as a ricochet weapon). Typical of a Konami shooter, Thunder Cross forces the player to beat the game twice in a harder loop of the first seven levels.</desc>

		<desc>The game uses variable rate scrolling (the screen scrolls at different speeds or not at all), and is played from a top-down view. Unlike space shooters, Thunder Dragon 2 is played in-atmosphere on a single world with contemporary airplanes.
The game contains eight stages, with popcorn enemies and ships with varying degrees of durability throughout. Each stage culminates in a boss fight, preceded by a warning. The player chooses between two different ships, a slow but powerful ship on the player 1 side, and a fast but weak ship on the player 2 side. Scoring is accomplished through enemy destruction, accumulation of medals dropped by enemies, and special bonus awards for completing specific tasks.</desc>

		<name>Timber</name>
		<desc>Timber is an abstract action game in which one or two players assume the role of a lumberjack and have a limited amount of time to chop down a given number of trees that pop up from the ground. The game is controlled with two joysticks, with one stick controlling the player's movement and the other corresponding to left or right chops with the player's axe. Difficulty increases with each level, with the number of trees needed to be chopped down gradually increasing (maxing out at 19) and the allotted time decreasing. 

During a round players must avoid beehives that are thrown at them by grizzly bears. The beehives, however, can be destroyed with the player's axe for a 500-point reward. Some trees contain birds that will run around the level after they have been chopped down, awarding 1,000 points if touched by the player.

Every couple of levels players are given the opportunity to amass bonus points. The bonus round begins with the lumberjack standing on a floating log. As the log begins to rotate, players must use their reflexes to stay on top of the log. The first two times this is played, the log is relatively large; on future attempts, the size of the log shrinks considerably. The bonus round ends if the player falls off the log or balances atop it for the duration of the round, in which case 1,000 bonus points are earned.

The two-player simultaneous mode can be played either competitively or cooperatively. In this mode, chopping or pushing down a tree such that it falls on the opponent awards you with 1,000 points.</desc>

		<desc>Time Pilot '84 is an eight-way scrolling shoot 'em up and is the sequel to 1982's 'Time Pilot'. As with the prequel, the game's stages are set over different periods in time. Players must destroy a set number of enemy ships, after which an end-of-level guardian appears. Once this is destroyed the player's ship warps to the next stage. 

The player's ship is armed with both a forward-firing gun and an infinite number of homing missiles. Each stage consists of both green and metallic enemies, the green enemies can be destroyed with the standard gun, but both metallic enemies and the end-of-stage guardian can only be killed with homing missiles. As the player's ship gets close to a metallic enemy, a "lock-on" square will appear over it, fired homing missiles will then follow and hit the enemy. 

Unlike the prequel, which displayed the year in which each level was set, the time periods of 'Time Pilot '84' are indicated by new enemies and different backgrounds.</desc>

They have the power to drop their Tinker power balls, which are both invulnerable to the enemies, and move around by pressing the Line button, therefore creating a line between them and their power balls. Releasing the button makes their power balls come back to them; the enemies are killed by having the power balls slam into them. There are also pieces of popcorn which can be picked up around the mazes - and pressing the Popcorn button, Pitt and Patti can throw them at the enemies, and they shall bounce off the walls until they hit one (or evaporate if they have not done so by the end of the stage). 

Killing all enemies in a maze advances the player to the next stage; however, in the event of one enemy remaining, he will make for the nearest corner of the maze, say "Bye-bye!", and disappear - which will detract from the "Pursuit Bonus" that the players will receive after they defeat Mao at the end of the game.</desc>

It features elements of tongue-in-cheek humor combined with the action. The player takes control of an enchanted ape who must battle hordes of jungle monsters with energy balls from his mouth (described humorously as "monkey-spit" or "monkey-vomit" by some gamers). The ultimate goal is to destroy the evil wizard who cast a spell on you; therefore transforming yourself from an ape back into a human, and rescuing the kidnapped princess. The game was ported to several video game consoles and home computers.</desc>

		<name>Bionic Commando</name>
		<desc>Bionic Commando aka as Top Secret is a scrolling platform shoot-em-up set ten years after the end of World War III, with the player taking on the role of 'Super Joe'; an elite Commando tasked with infiltrating the enemy's heavily defended military base to discover their secrets plans and destroy their missile silos. 

To aid him in his mission, Joe is equipped with a bionic arm; a telescopic grappling hook that is used to traverse the many platforms and ledges that make up the game's levels. The arm can also be used to temporarily stun enemies or knock them from platforms, as well as to retrieve the bonus items, wooden crates and weapons that are occasionally dropped into the war zone by parachute. 

As well as the bionic arm, Joe is armed with a shotgun used to kill enemies and destroy obstructions. The shotgun can only be fired left and right, however, and cannot be used at the same time as the bionic arm. More powerful guns can be picked up throughout the game. </desc>

		<name>Tron</name>
		<desc>Tron is a 1- or 2-player game set inside the 'Tron' computer, and is based on the ground-breaking Disney movie of the same name.

Tron consists of twenty-two stages - or 'phases' - of play. Each phase consists of four separate games called "domains", all of which must be completed before moving on to the next phase. Players can determine the order in which each of the four domains is attempted, but the domain position is random and is only revealed once that domain has been chosen.

The four domains that make up a phase never change throughout the game, although both the difficulty level and number of enemies increases with each subsequent phase. The domains are as follows:

LIGHT CYCLES: The player controls a Light Cycle that leaves a blue light trail in its wake. The aim is to 'box in' the yellow enemy Light Cycles, making them crash into either a cycle trail (theirs or the player's) or a wall. The player must also avoid any collision with either walls or light trails. The joystick controls the direction of the bike and the trigger controls its speed.
I/O TOWER: Destroy the Grid Bugs that emerge from the grid surrounding the tower. The bugs will multiply and fill the entire screen if not stopped. Players must attempt to clear a path to - and enter - the I/O Tower before the timer runs out. The stick controls the movement of the player's character and the spinner controls the direction of fire.
TANK MAZE: Destroy all enemy tanks that are patrolling the maze. The player's tank can fire in all directions and can bounce shots off walls, but can be destroyed by a single shot; while enemy tanks can only fire in the direction of travel but need three shots before they are destroyed. "Recognizer" tanks also feature in later phases; these Do NOT shoot but move quickly and will try to ram the player's tank. The joystick controls the movement of the player's tank and the spinner controls the direction of fire.
MCP CONE: Destroy the blocks in the descending, rotating coloured column to clear a path and move the character up into the light cone above the blocks. A bonus is awarded if all of the blocks are destroyed. The stick controls the movement of the character and the spinner controls the direction of fire.

Bonus lives are awarded periodically throughout the game as specific point scores are reached. Each enemy and item has an assigned point value (see the "SCORING" section for details).</desc>

		<desc>An abstract take on the 3d racing genre, Tropical Angel puts the player in control of a female water-skier who must dodge the many rocks that protrude from the water while attempting to steer through a set number of gates - in the form of a pair of flags - before the time limit expires. The acceleration button needs to be held down all the time while the 'trick' button makes the water-skiing girl spin through one-eighty degrees and proceed to ski backwards. The player cannot steer while traveling backwards, but will earn bonus points for the duration of the trick. As the game progresses, small ramps, buoys and sharks come into play. The small ramps can be jumped to add to the player's score, although they're always in difficult to reach locations. The buoys are usually very close together, but skiing between them earns bonus points. Finally, the shark will appear from time-to-time, running into it means game over, regardless of how much time the player has left.</desc>

		<desc>Tumble Pop is a platform game for one or two players in which the aim is to clear each level of enemies by sucking them into - then ejecting them from - a portable vacuum-cleaner. 

Holding down the fire button sucks the enemies into the cleaner, releasing the button causes them to be expelled back out. Ejected enemies act as projectiles that can damage and kill any other on-screen enemies that they collide with. All enemies must be killed before players can progress to the next stage. 

Throughout the game, letters of the alphabet randomly appear in bubbles. These can be collected to eventually spell the word "TUMBLEPOP". Once this has been achieved players are transported to a time-limited bonus level, giving them the opportunity to earn bonus points and extra lives.

		<desc>A vertical shoot-em-up that places the player's helicopter against multiple attacking targets in the air, sea, and land. Collecting the weapon and speed power-ups throughout the game is vital since the gameplay is quite difficult.

The object of the game, which is not explained further, is to avenge Joe's brother - which is probably not assumed to be the player, but presumably a friend of the player who lost his brother to the enemy. (It uses bad English grammar on the subtitle of the screen, using "revenge" as a verb, as apposed to "avenge".  That being said, it's a pretty tight game otherwise.)  To do so, you must destroy the fortress on the very last level. When you start the game and it scrolls onto the starting screen, the background contains the different levels that you must survive. The starting position of the various enemies does not vary from game to game.</desc>

		<name>Twin Eagle II - The Rescue Mission</name>
		<desc>Twin Eagle II is a vertical scrolling shooter where one or two players pilot heavily armed helicopters through three stages with three areas each.

At the start of each stage, the players select their path of attack through the three areas.  Areas with ground level enemies and targets are presented in a 3/4 isometric view, while areas with no ground targets feature scrolling landscape images.  Players use their guns to attack flying enemy aircraft and bombs to attack ground targets such as tanks, rocket launchers and high-rise skyscrapers.  If things get too hairy, the player can use a missile barrage to clear the screen of enemies and enemy firepower.  Destroying some buildings reveal primary colored trucks which drop weapon power-ups and point items when destroyed.  Each area features a boss at the end, which must be destroyed to advance past the area.  The final stage features one additional boss before the end of the game.</desc>

Power-ups and extra points can be found in special bells hidden in some enemies that, when shot a certain number of times, will change color and then, when touched by the player, will provide a powerup, such as extra speed.</desc>

The player can also walk over holes to change them to black tiles, which then can be changed to purple by doing either of those 2 things. Sometimes, a crown will appear. By walking over the crown, the level automatically ends and the player is transported a few levels beyond the last one. There are several enemies including various soldiers, knights, elephants, ostrich like birds, archers, and royal characters like princes, queens, and kings that the player can shoot to temporarily defeat. There is also a flat block that can only be defeated by shooting at its narrow side (not directly from the front or behind). There are also flashing tiles that the player has to get to prevent the cracking of the tiles. Once the player steps on or shoots these, he is temporarily invincible until the screen stops flashing.</desc>

In single-player mode, one person controls both characters on a team. In two-player mode, the players either cooperate by playing on the same team or compete against each other by controlling opposing teams. The American version allows the game to be played by up to four players (if the cabinet allows it). The single-player mode consists of two cycles with four stages: the Minor Circuit and the Major Circuit. The stages in the game are Daytona Beach, New York, Los Angeles and Hawaii. After completing the Major Circuit, the player faces against the U.S. Navy team, set in a naval base.

The controls consist of an eight directional joystick and two buttons for jumping and receiving. The characters perform several moves including power spiking, back spiking, jump-serving, blocking and diving.

There are a few minor differences between the Japanese and American releases. The Japanese release features an opening cut-scene explaining the plot. Between matches, intermission sequences depict the main characters visiting a car dealership to purchase a vehicle. As the player progresses, the cars increase in quality, shifting from used cars to new cars during the Major Circuit. The American release removes these cut-scenes, but extends the multiplayer support to up to four players with multiple game modes: 1 or 2 players against the computer, 1-on-1, 2-on-1, or 2-on-2.</desc>

		<desc>Undercover Cops is a horizontally-scrolling beat-em-up for up to three players in which Dr. Clayborn and his henchmen have taken control of the city. Police Commissioner Gordon has called on three of New York's Finest undercover cops: Bubba, an ex-professional football player; Flame, a former Miss America; and Claude, a retired philosophy teacher. They must fight every lackey and vanquish Dr. Clayborn in order to restore law and order to the city. 

Besides the usual human thugs, players fight strange mole creatures and mutants with jet packs and blades for hands. Players can never use enemy weapons, but the stages contain objects that can be picked up and used instead, These include burning oil drums, steel girders, concrete columns that shatter on impact, boxes of hand grenades and giant fish. 

As well as the standard punch and kick moves, each character also has a special attack. This move is more powerful than standard attacks but each time a special attack is executed, some of the player's health is lost.

Player characters can eat mice, frogs, birds and snails to restore their health. The game consists of five stages with a powerful enemy boss character waiting at the end of each one.</desc>

The game introduced two new playable characters, Donovan Baine and Hsien-Ko, who were out to hunt the other Darkstalkers (hence the Japanese title, Vampire Hunter). The two bosses from the first game, Huitzil and Pyron, were now playable characters as well. The game was first released for arcades and later ported to the Sega Saturn. Character art was done by Ikeno.</desc>

Keep a close eye on your ever decreasing fuel gauge, luckily each enemy that you destroy will add to your remaining fuel. Find the energy pods to be temporarily invulnerable; the energy pods will also increase your fuel level. At the end of each level you must defeat a boss that is guarded by two moving force fields with holes in them. The computer will announce the name of the each zone using some nifty early 80's synthesized speech. The different levels include Mountain Zone, Rainbow Zone, Styx Zone, Rainbow Zone 2, Stripe Zone, Rainbow Zone 3, Bleak Zone, and the City of Mystery.</desc>

		<desc>Venture is a 1- or 2-player "Gauntlet" style game (although Venture pre-dates the Atari legend by 4 years) set in a multi-level dungeon. The player, armed with a bow and arrow fights through enemy infested levels in the quest to collect treasure.

Each dungeon is represented as a floor plan, populated with a number of "Space Invader" like monsters. Numerous rooms and their corresponding doors are clearly marked; these rooms are the treasure rooms and each one must be cleared. When the player enters a room, the viewpoint zooms in on the action and the room takes up the whole screen. Each room has a treasure or weapon guarded by one or more creatures. Players must try to retrieve the treasure while avoiding (or killing) creatures and obstacles. Only in the rooms themselves can players use their bow and arrow.

When the treasure is successfully taken out of the chamber, bonus points are awarded. The screen image then returns to the original, zoomed-out floor plan and the player moves on to the next room of their choice. Once a room has been cleared of its item, the player no longer has access to that room. The player must collect all of the treasures on the current level before descending to another dungeon.</desc>

The guardians must be defeated as quickly as possible as their energy bars will replenish in between the player's attacks.

A weapon, in the form of Nunchakas, can occasionally be found and picked-up; adding to the player's 'kick' and 'punch' fighting moves. Some of the game's many enemies are also armed, with either clubs, chains, knives or guns. The game ends once Madonna is rescued.</desc>

		<desc>Control different characters with various fighting styles and engage in single or two-player bouts.

In the early 1950's, a game called Violence Fight was popular in the US crime world. Fighters from all over the USA would compete against each other to become that year's champion. The winner stood to make a considerable amount of money. 

In downtown LA, a manager called Blinks is training up a new fighter called Bad Blue. He is a strong contender to become the champion and desperately needs the prize money.</desc>

		<name>Violent Storm</name>
		<desc>Violent Storm is a sideways-scrolling beat-em-up for up to three players set in the aftermath of World War III. The survivors of the war are attempting to rebuild their world but are being terrorised by violent gangs . Three vigilante heroes called 'Boris', 'Wade' and 'Kyle' are trying to protect the citizens but are hampered in their efforts by the evil and corrupt 'GELD' gang. As the heroes are patrolling the streets, they see their friend, Sheena, kidnapped by the gang. The vigilantes must fight through seven enemy-packed stages to rescue their friend and destroy the gang.

As well as the standard punch and kick moves, each character also has a special attack. This move is powerful enough to fell several enemies at once, but with the trade-off that each time a special attack is executed, some of the player's health is lost. Health levels can be replenished by finding the food that lies hidden in breakable crates and barrels. 

Some of the gang members will drop a weapon when they are felled. These weapons can then be picked up and used by the players. Destructible crates and barrels also contain weapons and random bonus items. Stunned enemies fall to the ground and can still be attacked while prone.</desc>

The player takes control of Mikey and must explore a variety of caverns and rooms, searching for the three keys needed to unlock the huge, metal door that bars progress to the next level. The keys are hidden behind a number of doors which can only be removed by placing a bomb in front of them and blowing them open. Mikey's progress is hampered by the many enemies that roam the levels. The bombs needed to blow the doors appear when certain enemies are killed.

A fellow 'Goonie' is trapped behind one of the doors on each level, and can be rescued, although this isn't necessary to progress to the next level. A catapult, or 'slingshot', can also be found, allowing Mikey to attack enemies from a safe distance.</desc>

You only have two weapons, your blaster, and a limited supply of bombs. This title uses the time honored top-down vertically scrolling format. The background moves eternally forward, but you can move all around the screen, and can make the screen scroll both left and right. Your enemies consist of an assortment of fairly realistic looking spacecraft, some of which have a distinctive 'insectoid' look to them. This game is endless and it doesn't seem to have a level format. You just move forward and shoot. The backgrounds will change from time to time from planetary surfaces to space scenes and eventually they will start repeating once you blast this particularly large alien formation.</desc>

		<name>Warlords</name>
		<desc>Atari's Warlords depicts a third-person view of four castles. The player-controlled Warlords and computer-controlled Black Knights use shields to defend their castle walls from the fireballs that ricochet around the playfield. 

Players can capture and catapult the fireballs at opposing castles, using their shield control and 'Power Stone' pushbutton. When a fireball hits a castle wall, it destroys one or more bricks, depending on its speed. 

A castle not paid for is controlled by the computer, with a Black Knight displayed in the appropriate castle. The Black Knights catapult fireballs at the players with increasing accuracy, to provide challenge. 

Game play begins when any start button is pressed and the countdown has ended. The game ends when the last Warlord's castle (containing a crown) has been penetrated by a fireball. At this point a white cloud envelopes the crown, and the latter disappears. 

During the countdown, a dragon flies back and forth across the screen with a fireball in its mouth. At the end of the countdown, a position activated by a Start button has its Black Knight changed to a Warlord's crown. A position not activated remains as a Black Knight and is controlled by the computer. The dragon then spits the fireball from its mouth toward a Warlord's castle. 

The objective is to destroy the three other castles, while protecting one's own castle with the moving shield. The LED pushbuttons have dual functions: in the Ready-to-Play mode they work as Start switches, and during game play they become 'Power Stones' to allow players to capture and catapult fireballs at opponents.

Players must then fight their way through a multitude of enemy-packed levels set in a variety of different locations, such as castles, a forest, a swamp and on board a sinking ship. Certain levels also have the players riding on animals, such as horses and dragons. Coins and treasure items can be found in the numerous barrels and chests that litter the levels, as well as being dropped by some defeated enemies. Bonus points and "vitality" - depending on the amount of treasure collected - are awarded upon the level's completion.</desc>

The objective is to complete the course in as fast a time as possible to reach the next course, while avoiding rocks, sharks, motor boats, wind surfers and numerous other obstacles.

The player can move their skier left or right, and can press buttons to either slow the boat's speed or to jump over obstacles. Small rocks are the most common obstacle and can either be avoided or jumped over. As well as the small rocks that litter each course, there are also occasional large rocks; these cannot be jumped and must be avoided at all costs. Also, players must be watchful of the direction their tow-boat takes them otherwise they risk being dragged into oncoming obstacles or having their tow-rope snapped on one of the large rocks.</desc>

The track itself was incredibly demanding and contact with either a rival racer or one of the many track-side objects would send the player's vehicle flying dramatically through the air, costing valuable seconds in time.</desc>

		<name>Wild Fang</name>
		<desc>Wild Fang is a sideways scrolling beat-em-up for 1 or 2 players with a medieval setting. Players take on a variety of orcs, ogres, demons and other mythical creatures in their bid to destroy Satan, decapitating each enemy they encounter in order to collect their skulls for points and power-ups.

The player's character is an armor wearing beastmaster who sits atop of a fist-fighting giant.  Upon the player's command, the player may switch his mount into a tiger and attack with his mace.  Within each stage, there are also power-ups that allow the player to morph into a laser breathing dragon for a limited period of time.

The player's life bar is represented by a fire breathing dragon in the upper corner.  With each hit the player takes, the fire breath grows smaller.  Once the life bar is depleted the player's mount is killed and the player travels on foot and fights with throwing daggers.  If hit in this form then the player loses a life.  The game is over when all of a players lives are lost.</desc>

		<desc>Windjammers is based on a real-life sport known as Saucer Tennis or Frisbee Tennis. You and an opponent face off in an arena with a low net in the middle. Points are scored by throwing a disc into the goals behind a player or whenever your opponent is not able to catch the disc in time. There are two moves: a regular throw and a lob. By using quarter-circle movement, you can also add effect to the throw. To catch difficult discs, you can slide to move more quickly. There are six characters to choose from, with specific abilities and their own court fit for their skills. A single game consists of short sets of thirty seconds. The game is won after two winning sets or sudden death after two draws.</desc>

		<desc>Wizard of Wor is a maze-based shoot-em-up featuring one or co-operative two-player gameplay. In a two-player game, player one controls yellow Worriors while player two controls blue Worriors. Players are also able to shoot each other's Worriors, earning bonus points and causing the other player to lose a life. Team-oriented players can successfully advance through the game by standing back-to-back and firing at anything that comes at them.

Each single-screen dungeon consists of a grid forming walls and corridors. There are doors situated at the left and right edges of the screen that are inter-connected, making the dungeon wrap around. Whenever a door is used by a player or monster, it deactivates for a short period, making it impassable. A small radar display indicates the positions of all active monsters.

		<desc>Wonder Boy in Monster Land is a multi-directional scrolling platform hack 'n' slash game with RPG elements, in which the game's hero, Wonder Boy, has seen his home of Wonderland invaded by the evil 'MEKA Dragon' and its army of minions. 

At the start of the game Wonder Boy is unarmed, but the mayor of Wonder Land (as it was known before the invasion) gives him a short sword to help him in his quest. Wonder Boy has a life meter represented as a series of red hearts and whenever he sustains damage, the hearts deplete. When all the hearts are depleted, Wonder Boy dies and the game ends. As well as the life meter, there is also an Hourglass Timer at the top of the screen; whenever this runs out, Wonder Boy loses some life. The Timer can be refilled by collecting hourglasses or by visiting hospitals or taverns.</desc>

		<desc>The game centers around an unusual alien invasion against a colony planet in the year 2249 the aliens themselves are microscopic creatures that invade, infect, and kill the colonists. Scientists have deployed the microscopic fighter X-002 into the body of the hapless woman whose body has been invaded by the alien queen.

The game itself is a side-scroller like R-Type, albeit with a short vertical-scrolling area towards the end of the sixth level. Instead of the Force pod, however, the main power-up apparatus takes the form of two flexible tentacles. The tentacles are invulnerable to all enemy attacks, and can be positioned with careful maneuvering of the X-002.</desc>

Now the Xevions want Earth back -- minus humans! Their invasion forces are fierce -- the land is crawling with deadly Domogram Rovers; the sky is black with Toroid Patrol Fleets and Zoshi Death Squads.

Our puny weapons offer no defense. Earth's only hope is our powerful new Solvalou Fighter Plane. Its pilot will have a single mission: Penetrate the enemy ranks and destroy the Xevious Mother Ship.

The mission is dangerous. We can't guarantee success. But at this point, it's do or die!

One small problem. We still need a pilot. Any volunteers?</desc>

		<name>Xexex</name>
		<desc>Xexex is a horizontally-scrolling shoot-em-up in which players pilot a ship called the 'Flintlock' and must save the blue-haired Princess Irene of the planet E-Square from an evil lord named Klaus. 

The player's ship has a detachable orb attachment called the Flint, which behaves in a similar fashion to the 'Force Device' from Irem's "R-Type" series. Power-ups can be obtained to increase the Flint's power, movement speed, change the main weapon, or even give the player an extra life.

The player starts the game armed with the Proton Laser, which emits thin stream of weak bullets. Defeating certain enemies will drop other weapons:
Homing Laser: A 3-way laser with weak "bending" homing for top and bottom lasers.
Shadow Laser: A laser beam that creates a damage-inflicting shadow as the ship moves up and down. 
Round Laser: An unusual spread shot (different from the overseas version's main weapon)
Spiral Laser: A spiral laser of considerable width.
Search Laser: A laser with strong homing that travels in square trajectories.
Ground Laser: Fires an upgraded Proton Laser along with a laser beam that travels along the ground.

The name of the current weapon is displayed at the bottom of the screen. In the non-Japanese overseas versions, the only available weapon is the Proton Laser and picking up power-ups simply increases the spread of the weapon. Missiles are a secondary weapon.</desc>

		<name>Xybots</name>
		<desc>Xybots is a 3-Dimensional, 3rd-person perspective shoot-em-up for 1 or 2 players. Taking on the role of either 'Major Rock Hardy' or 'Captain Ace Gunn' (in the 2-player game), players must shoot their way through a huge, multi-level underground city - made up of a series of mazes - and destroy the evil 'Xybot' robot warriors that have invaded the planet and established their underground fortress. The players' on-screen counterparts walk 'into' the screen and players must manually rotate the maze's viewpoint left and right when changing direction in order to be able to look in the direction they are moving. 

Each level has at least one exit that must be reached in order to progress to the next (some levels have extra hidden exits that 'warp' players to later levels). Players can find energy pods to restore energy levels, keys to open doors, and golden coins. Some of the levels also feature transporters that connect different parts of the same level.

At the end of each level, players can enter a shop where supplies and power-ups can be purchased with any coins they have collected. Some supplies, such as 'Shield' or 'Speed' are permanent, whereas others are only temporary and must be replenished.

A map of each level is displayed at the top of the screen. For some levels, all enemies, objects and walls are shown. On later levels, however, the map may only display the enemy robots and/or objects; with the maze walls and layout only becoming visible once a player has 'looked' at a wall section. Xybots' gameplay feels highly reminiscent of a 3-Dimensional "Gauntlet" (with good reason, see TRIVIA for more details). The game also uses a split-screen display to allow for two-player simultaneous play; something of an innovation for 1987.

Like the "Gauntlet" games on which Xybots is based; the game is endless and play will continue until all lives are lost and players no longer wish to use the 'Continue' option.</desc>

		<desc>Yie Ar Kung-fu is a single-player one-on-one fighting game in which the player takes on the role of 'Oolong' who must fight and defeat eleven martial arts masters. His ulimate goal is to win the title of "Grand Master" and honour the memory of his father, who was killed while fighting the current grand master.

The player faces a variety of opponents, each with a unique appearance and fighting style. Some opponents are also armed, with weapons including nunchaku, throwing stars and a club. The player can perform up to 16 different moves using a combination of buttons and joystick movements while standing, crouching or jumping. Moves are thrown at high, middle, and low levels. 

Yie Ar Kung-Fu plays incredibly quickly, with the player having to be constantly on the move to avoid getting 'pegged in' by some of the game's tougher opponents. There is no time limit in which the opponent must be defeated but Oolong possesses a finite amount of health, represented by a health bar at the top of the screen. Once Oolong's health is fully depleted, the match is over.

On deep space you must fly the 'Zogram' (your spaceship fighter) and destroy hordes of enemies, while dodge space objects.

Destroy eight 'Mitiohro' around the 'Goke' (the enemy base) for takeoff and landing of 'Ahro' (the enemy's fighter). After destroying all the 'Mitiohro', return to the 'Battlestar-asat' base.

The color of 'Mitiohro' on the picture changes when the gates for takeoff and landing of 'Ahro' opens. It is the time to attack!

As you destroy 'Ahro', 'Mitiohro' becomes to leave the 'Goke's' body, but you cannot destroy those 'Mitiohro' with your laser beam.

You can get a higher score depending of the precision landing of your spaceship at nearer spot to the center of the 'Battlestar-asat' base.

When you score 20,000 points, you can get one more Zogram and at 50,000 points you can get another Zogram.</desc>

Lola -- whose affection is not easily captured. ZZYZZYXX's vulnerability increases (as he collects gifts, as well as points) not only because of Lola's untouchable attitude, but because of obstacles such as rattifers trying to put an end to ZZYZZYXX's quest for Lola's love and affection.

Intelligent as the rattifers may be, there are 2 defenses ZZYZZYXX can use to outsmart the destructive creatures. ZZYZZYXX can brick himself within a brick when he sees an approaching rattifer or ZZYZZYXX can move into the space where there is a gold helmet. The gold helmet intensifies ZZYZZYXX's goal to reach Lola by allowing ZZYZZYXX to use the helmet to enclose a rattifer or break through one brick which is obstructing ZZYZZYXX's course towards Lola.

As irreproachable as Lola appears. Lola is overjoyed by ZZYZZYXX's success to retrieve enough presents and she whistles resoundingly to let ZZYZZYXX know. After ZZYZZYXX's triumphant deed for love. ZZYZZYXX becomes invincible, enabling him to elude the rattifers by imprisoning them within their spaces.

Other dangers testing ZZYZZYXX's skillful maneuvering are falling bombs, rising missiles and cracked bricks, each capable of disintegrating ZZYZZYXX.

As an added attraction, when a game player completes each level, there are animated cartoons depicting ZZYZZYXX's passionate desire to impress his love for Lola. Also delightful music throughout the game leaves the players humming and their foot tapping.</desc>

		<name>1942</name>
		<desc>"1942" is a vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up set in the Pacific theatre during World War II, in which the goal is to reach Tokyo and destroy the entire Japanese air fleet. 

The player pilots a plane dubbed the "Super Ace" (its appearance is that of a Lockheed P-38 Lightning) and has to shoot down waves of enemy planes while avoiding incoming enemy fire. The 'Super Ace' can perform a limited number of rolls or 'loop-the-loops' to evade enemy planes and shots. 

During the game, waves of red enemy planes periodically appear. If the player manages to destroy a red wave, a power-up, in the form of a 'POW' symbol, will be dropped and can be picked up. The power-up will award either increased fire-power (doubling the player's guns from two to four), a smart bomb that destroys all on-screen enemy planes the instant it's collected, two wingmen planes that flank the Super Ace and increase fire power, or simply extra points.

At the end of each stage the 'Super Ace' lands on an aircraft carrier and bonus points are awarded based on player performance. "1942" differs from other games in that its levels are numbered in reverse order, so the game begins at stage 32 and ends at stage 1.</desc>

		<name>Aliens</name>
		<desc>Aliens is a scrolling run 'n' gun game for one or two players based on the classic 1986 science-fiction movie of the same name. Players take on the role of either Ellen Ripley (in the single-player game) or Corporal Hicks (in the two-player game) and must shoot their way through the alien-infested levels of the LV426 base to make their escape together with 'Newt', the little girl who survived the alien invasion of her settlement.

Players begin the game armed only with a pulse rifle but will have opportunities to upgrade to other weapons, including flamethrowers and grenade launchers. Bombs can also be found that cause greater damage to the enemies. Each player life starts with eight health points which deplete upon contact with either an alien or an enemy projectile and once all health points are lost, the player loses a life. Each stage ends with a Boss encounter, with the game's final boss being the Alien Queen herself. 

As well as the standard side-scrolling stages, intermittent into-the-screen stages also feature that have the players riding atop the Marines' APC vehicle, shooting the hordes of aliens that swarm towards it.

As well as the standard Aliens and Face-huggers from the original film (that now come in a variety of different colours), there are many enemies that were created only for the arcade game and have never appeared elsewhere in the Alien franchise. These include flying aliens and mutated humans, as well as all end-of-stage bosses prior to the Alien queen.</desc>

		<name>Bomb Jack</name>
		<desc>Bomb Jack is a fast-moving platform game in which the aim is to collect all of the bombs on each level before progressing to the next. A variety of constantly spawning mechanical enemies patrol the platforms and airspace so the longer a player takes to collect all of the bombs, the more difficult progress becomes. 

Extra point bonuses are awarded for collecting bombs with their fuses lit. Only one bomb at any time has a lit fuse, and collecting twenty or more of these lit bombs on any given level will earn the player points bonus (see TIPS AND TRICKS for details). Jack is pursued around each level by the spawning enemies and when he gets killed, he drops down to the nearest platform, always landing on his head. 

A 'Powerball' appears at semi-regular intervals and moves diagonally around the screen. If the player manages to grab this, all of the level's monsters are frozen for several seconds and can then be killed by having Jack fly into them (similar to the 'Powerpill' feature in "Pac-Man"). Collecting the Bonus 'B' symbols will increase the amount of points awarded for collecting bombs with their fuses lit. Picking up an 'Extra' symbol awards the player with an additional life, while catching the 'Special' symbol will give the player an extra credit. 

Each of Bomb Jack's levels feature one of five different background pictures, some of which represent famous historical landmarks. They are: the Sphinx in Egypt, the Acropolis in Greece, Castle Neuschwanstein in Bavaria, skyscrapers and a cityscape by night. While the backgrounds themselves are repeated as the game progresses, the platform layouts for each level are completely different. At least until level 18, after which the levels are repeated. 

The basic play mechanic of collecting objects to clear a level, as well as the powerball feature, is hugely reminiscent of Namco's seminal "Pac-Man".</desc>

		<name>Bombjack Twin</name>
		<desc>Bomb Jack Twin is a direct sequel to the 1984 original and retains the same platform-based collect-the-bombs gameplay of its predecessor.

Changes over the original game include a slightly faster playing tempo and the option for simultaneous two-player action. As with the prequel, extra points and bonuses can be earned by collecting bonus coins and bombs with their fuses still lit. Bomb Jack Twin also retains the 'Powerball' feature of its predecessor which, when collected, freezes the level's enemies for several seconds, allowing them to be destroyed.

The way the sequel's levels are structured differs significantly from the original game. In "Bomb Jack", each screen was simply numbered sequentially and the background picture changed on every screen, but the stages in "Bomb Jack Twin" are grouped into 'rounds', each consisting of three screen layouts but retaining a single background picture for the duration of that round.

Another new addition is the bonus screen. This appears every couple of rounds and players must try to collect all bombs on the screen within a tight time limit to earn extra bonus points. There are no enemies on the bonus screens and the background is plain black.

As with the first game, "Bomb Jack Twin" takes place in different locations throughout the world. A map screen is displayed before the start of each new round showing the next location. The available locations are: Germany, Thailand, Nevada, Japan, England, Hong Kong and China.</desc>

		<desc>A classic 1 or 2-player western gunfight game, featuring a monochrome display overlaid via mirror onto back-lit plastic background. Each player uses a small joystick to move their cowboy up and down the play area, while a second, much larger joystick is used to aim the pistol and shoot - this larger stick also has a trigger button. The game's single goal is simply to shoot the other player, who is situated on the opposite side of the game area. Wagons and cacti litter the middle of the play area, providing temporary cover from the opponent's gunfire (while, of course, providing the opponent with cover from the PLAYER'S shots). These obstacles slowly disintegrate as they are shot; much like the shields in Taito's "Space Invaders".

Boot Hill is time-based NOT life based, with the factory default set at ninety seconds. This is, of course, operator adjustable via the dip settings. The computer opponent is quite easy to beat with a little practice, but a human opponent provides a much stronger challenge.</desc>

		<name>Alien Storm</name>
		<desc>Alien Storm is a side-scrolling beat-em-up in which up to 3 players take on the role of one of 3 futuristic warriors. The game heroes are charged with destroying the hoards of repulsive aliens who are invading the Earth. Many of the aliens are disguised as a variety of everyday street objects; such as telephone booths, oil cans, trash cans and mailboxes. The aliens reveal their true forms as the warriors approach.

Each of the 3 heroes carries their own individual weapon; Gordon has his plasma gun, Karla has a flamethrower and Scooter has an electric whip. At the end of each level, the warriors will enter a building and the shoot-em-up action will switch to a first-person perspective.</desc>

		<name>Alien Syndrome</name>
		<desc>Alien Syndrome is a overhead-view run and gun game for one or two players in which a number of Mankind's space ships and bases have been overrun by an alien race, who have taken the human inhabitants hostage.

Players control two soldiers named Ricky and Mary and must fight their way through large eight-way scrolling levels to rescue their captured comrades. Once a set number of hostages have been rescued, an exit opens and players can pass through it to fight the end-of-level guardian. Once the guardian is defeated, play moves onto the next stage.

A time-bomb is automatically set at the start of each stage, which must then be completed before the bomb's timer runs down. Failure to finish the level in time results in the death of the player characters. Weapon upgrades and maps of the current level are available at certain points and are accessed via hatchways in the wall.

Alien Syndrome consists of 6 full stages plus a 7th final mini-stage, consisting solely of a fight to the death against the game's final, massive guardian.</desc>

		<desc>San Drad, California, has been overrun by the Aliens, and the cybernetically-enhanced Major Dutch Schaefer and Lieutenant Linn Kurosawa have been abandoned by their superiors and are cornered by a swarm of the Alien drones. Before they can be killed, a pair of the Predators appear and destroy the Aliens. The Predators offer an alliance with the two humans in order to stop the Alien infestation.

The players take control of up to three of four characters: Dutch, Linn, a Predator hunter, and a Predator warrior, and battle the Aliens through several environments. In the process, the characters discover that the Alien presence on Earth is the result of an experiment headed by a renegade General Bush of the U.S. Colonial Marines in conjunction with the Weyland-Yutani corporation. They destroy the Alien hive by crashing a military ship into San Drad, causing a huge explosion. The Predator warrior then gives his wrist blades to Dutch and Linn in recognition of their skills as warriors, before the Predators depart back into space.</desc>

There are six rows of rocks to deal with. You start with a 6-storied platform and you lose one platform per row of rocks cleared. You score points for those rocks you prevent from reaching the ground. Of course, the farther the row of rocks, the smaller and faster they become. Your ultimate goal is to get enough points so that you can continue your game should you lose your first one. Get your hard hat out and prepare to catch some rogue rocks.</desc>

		<desc>Bubble Bobble II, also known as Bubble Symphony, is the first direct sequel to Taito's 1986 platform classic, "Bubble Bobble" ('Rainbow Islands' was the first official sequel, but played very differently) in which one or two players take on the role of the infamous bubble-blowing dinosaurs who must once again fight their way through a large number of single-screen platform-based levels, trapping monsters with their bubbles before bursting them to destroy the trapped enemies. 

While the game plays identically to its predecessor, several new changes and additions have been made to breathe new life into the classic gameplay. As well as new bonuses, weapons, enemies and characters, players can now create 'Multiple Bubbles'; if the player holds the button down for a few seconds before releasing, up to three bubbles are produced at once. </desc>

But sponges, roaches, brushes, and razor blades are deadly to a small bubble. Don't worry too much though, because your bubble grows in size as it swallows up the dirt in the sink. When it gets big enough it will be able to hit brushes and sponges (but still not razors).</desc>

The game was notable for its fast pseudo 3-D scaling and detailed sprites. The game would later go on to influence the 1985 Sega hit Space Harrier. Buck is never seen in the game, except presumably in the illustration on the side of the arcade cabinet, and its only real connections to Buck Rogers are the use of the name and the outer space setting. In Japan, the game was known as Zoom 909.</desc>

The chef must create a set number of burgers per level by collecting the separate ingredients needed to make each one (two pieces of bun, the burger itself and/or a garnish, such as lettuce or cheese). 

Each screen is made up of platforms joined by connecting ladders. At the bottom of the screen are a number of empty plates while the burger ingredients lay across the platforms directly above the plates. The chef must walk across the entire width of the ingredients to make them drop to the platform below. A burger is only completed once all of its ingredients have been dropped onto the corresponding plate at the bottom of the screen. 

The chef's efforts are hampered by the rogue ingredients that are constantly chasing him. They are called 'Mr. Hot Dog', 'Mr. Egg' and 'Mr. Pickle'. Any contact with them results in the loss of a life. The chef can temporarily freeze the enemies by throwing pepper at them. He only carries a limited amount of pepper but this can be replenished by collecting the bonus food items that randomly appear (ice cream cones, coffee, and fries). In addition to the pepper, any enemies located on a platform below the chef can be killed by dropping an available burger ingredient on top of them. .</desc>

To stop the fight, Metro police detectives dispatched two dangerous characters, Duke and Billy, to Japan. With the support of the famous Japanese detective Ryu, they decided to rush into the enemy's fortress. Ruthless violence in the neon lights of Osaka. Will there be an end to this war?

Burning Fight is a side-scrolling street-fighting game similar to Final Fight. As Duke, Billy, or Ryu, you must fight your way through the various locations in Osaka. At the start of the game, you can only use your fists to deal with gangs, but by by breaking things like phone booths and street signs along the way, you can get new weapons and more health. At the end of each location, you will have to defeat a boss in order to continue the mission.</desc>

		<name>Cabal</name>
		<desc>Cabal is a war themed shoot-em-up with one or simultaneous two-player gameplay in which two unnamed commandos must battle through five different stages - each containing four screens of play - to reach and defeat an evil dictator.

The game is an into-the-screen shooter with the action viewed from an over-the-shoulder perspective. The commandos can move left and right to avoid incoming fire while the enemies themselves are targeted by moving an on-screen cross-hair over them and pressing fire. If the fire button is held down, the commando remains static, allowing for more accurate targeting of the cross-hair. While static, the commandos are vulnerable to incoming enemy fire.

Initially, the commandos are armed with only a standard single-shot gun (albeit with unlimited-ammunition) and a limited number of grenades, but additional grenades and weapon power-ups can be earned as play progresses.

As well as enemy troops, vehicles such as tanks, armoured cars and helicopters also appear and take numerous shots to destroy. When destroyed or killed, some on-screen targets release points bonuses and weapon power-ups that drop to the bottom of the screen and can be picked up by the commandos. Weapon power-ups include additional grenades, a rapid-fire machine and an automatic shotgun, which has a slightly lower firing rate but has a larger targeting cross-hair, allowing it to strike a wider area with each shot.

Each of the game's screens is littered with buildings and barricades that can also be destroyed. This removes enemy cover as well as earning players bonus points.</desc>

		<name>Caveman Ninja</name>
		<desc>Caveman Ninja is a horizontally-scrolling platform beat-em-up set in prehistoric times with one or two players taking on the roles of cavemen Joe and Mac. Rival caveman have invaded Joe and Mac's village and kidnapped all of their women and it's up to the two heroes to venture forth and save them. 

Joe and Mac must battle through numerous prehistorically-themed stages, fighting enemy cavemen and marauding dinosaurs. The heroes are initially armed with throwing axes that can be tossed either vertically or horizontally, travelling in a short arc. By holding down the attack button, larger, more powerful weapons will be thrown. When close to an enemy, Joe and Mac will utilise a wooden club to whack them. Players can also jump much higher by holding UP and JUMP.

Joe and Mac each have a life meter that gradually depletes over time, with additional energy losses incurred when players are hit by a enemies or projectile. Food can be collected from defeated enemies to top up the players' energy levels. Different weapons can be found throughout the stages including stone wheels, fireballs, and shadowy doppelgangers that charge forward and attack enemies. Other power-ups include hot sauce or jalapeno peppers that give players temporary invincibility and fiery breath. 

Certain enemy strikes - such as being hit by a thrown boulder - will flatten Joe and Mac like pancakes for a few seconds, although they can still move and attack while in this form, albeit more slowly. During the simultaneous two-player game, both characters are capable of damaging each other. The game allows players to select between different routes after each boss battle. Also, after defeating the final boss, the players can choose between three exits, each one leading to a slightly different ending sequence.</desc>

		<name>Championship Sprint</name>
		<desc>Championship Sprint is an updated version of the old Atari Sprint series, with the added ability for players to upgrade their vehicles as the game progresses. Upgrades are won by collecting the bonus wrenches that appear once during each race, and once players have collected four wrenches, they will be presented with an upgrade screen; allowing them to choose better traction, top speed, acceleration, or a faster helicopter.

Collisions with barriers should, of course, be avoided, as they invariably cost the player valuable time. Also; a direct, head-on collision can cause the players' vehicles to explode - particularly if the player is moving at speed when this happens. In the event of a car exploding, a helicopter will automatically airlift a replacement vehicle to the track; this replacement will retain any previous upgrades made by the player. Waiting for the replacement car takes precious time and allows rival drivers to gain a distinct advantage. Car replacement time can be shortened upgrading the helicopter.

The tracks themselves are all variations on the basic 'oval', with gates, jumps, ramps and crossroads ensuring a demanding, yet incredibly playable game.</desc>

Bonuses can be picked up to increase the firepower, and barrels can either be smashed to reveal bonuses, or picked up and thrown at the enemies. In addition; the Ninja can perform high jump by pressing the JUMP button, then pressing it again while the Ninja is in the air. This is useful for avoiding enemies and essential for reaching high platforms.</desc>

		<name>Chiller</name>
		<desc>This is a gun game, and there are four different screens (plus two different bonus screens). The object is simply to shoot everything in sight (and to try and locate any hidden targets on the screen). The game is based on time, and the timer moves faster when you are shooting poorly.
The first screen is a torture chamber. There are four (still living) human targets on this screen. From left to right they are; a man chained to the wall, a person in a guillotine (shoot the top of the guillotine to decapitate them), a woman strapped in a strange machine, and a man in a head vise (shoot the vise to crush his head). The rest of the room is strewn with blood and loose body parts. You don't simply shoot each target once, instead you shoot each part of the target, which reduces that part to a mess of blood and bones. This is thankfully the most disturbing level in the game.
The second room is another torture chamber with a river of blood flowing through the middle. This one has five human targets; a man strapped to a board, a man chained to the floor, two people on stretching racks (shoot the wheels to pull them apart), and a woman hung from rope over the river (shoot a pulley to slowly lower her into the river to be eaten by crocodiles). Body parts will flow down the river randomly, and a man will pop out of a door from time to time to toss a blade into one of the helpless victims.
The third level is a haunted house hallway. There is only one human victim on this level. It is a woman who runs from one doorway to another, shoot out the trapdoor to cause her to fall inside (and then shoot the beast that was chasing her). Your other targets are mostly assorted ghosts, and a few random body parts that will fall from the ceiling.
The final level is a graveyard. Your only human victim on this level is a woman who is half buried in the ground, shooting her torso multiple times strips off her clothing until she is topless, and the last shot kills her. You other targets are bats, hands that pop up from the ground, and a man who pulls a cart full of body parts (you can't kill him, shooting him just makes him run away, only to return later).

The game repeats the levels over and over again until you manage to find every secret target on each screen (it gives you hints between the levels). Finding all the targets on a single screen earns you a bonus game (a slot machine), while finding all the hidden targets in the game gives you the second bonus game (a shooting gallery), and a free game.</desc>

		<name>Chimera Beast</name>
		<desc>A horizontally scrolling shoot'em up where 1 or 2 players control creatures known as 'eaters' which are capable of eating other creatures and taking their DNA, thus acquiring their abilities or characteristics.

Chimera Beast takes place on a planet which is described as distant and Earth-like. The planet is overrun by animals known as eaters, capable of eating other creatures and acquiring their abilities or characteristics. The player controls one of these eaters and progresses through the game by means of evolution, consuming microscopic organisms in the first stage, fish in the second, and so on. When the player's creature gets big enough to take on humanity, the goal of the game is revealed. The planet's humans have developed space travel, which the player must thwart, so as not to give the eaters a means of escaping the planet. There are two possible endings: one in which the player is able to stop the eaters from escaping the planet, and one in which the eaters do escape and, we are told, will eventually make their way to Earth.

The chief innovation of Chimera Beast is its power-up system. Instead of collecting gun upgrades as in most games of this genre, the player's eater enhances itself by eating other creatures and assuming their abilities and defenses. Instead of simply having various types of projectile weaponry, the game attempts to make these new abilities as varied as possible. Consuming a crustacean might give the player's eater a hard protective shell, for example, while an insectoid creature might offer a poisonous tail instead. The game even includes the ability to use cancer as a weapon.

Another difference from typical shooter mechanics is that the player's eater does not die after being hit. It has a life bar, which can be charged by consuming enemies. It is even possible to eat enough charge the life bar past its starting position, creating a larger eater which is not only more powerful but can take more damage as well.</desc>

Bonus points can be won by finishing a level as quickly as possible, with further points awarded for collecting any of the money bags that occasionally appear.

Finally, additional bonus points are awarded for completing a level without losing a life. The game is over when all Circus Charlies are lost.

The six different events are:
Ride a lion and jump through fiery hoops and over blazing pots. 
Jump over monkeys while walking a tightrope. 
Bounce on trampolines, avoid fire breathers and sword jugglers. 
Jump on giant, rolling beach balls. 
Ride a horse while avoiding obstacles.

		<desc>The object of Clay Pigeon was to shoot as many clay targets as you can, using an arcade light gun that was shaped like a shotgun. At the start of the game you are given the choice of selecting either Trap Shooting or Skeet Shooting. Trap shooting is where the clay target is thrown directly away from the shooter, while in skeet shooting the target is launched across the shooter's field of vision. The graphics are done in Exidy's realistic style, each round is played against a decent looking outdoor background, and an extremely repetitive announcer yells 'pull' to warn you of each and every target being launched. After several rounds of targets, you finally get to go after some real live animals! The real live animals are of course, ducks! The ducks are small and fly onto the screen in small groups of up to around a half dozen or so, and unlike the earlier title "Vs. Duck Hunt", you cannot miss any of these. Missing any ducks in this round ends the game instantly, and will more than likely have you fumbling for another quarter in an attempt to do it right this time.</desc>

		<desc>Clutch Hitter is a baseball game originally released for Sega System 18 hardware before being ported to the Sega Game Gear. The Game Gear version was only released in North America.

There are noticeable differences between the Japanese and US versions of the arcade game - the US version has a MLB license and uses US teams, while the Japanese version opts for Japanese players and teams. There are also subtle changes to the presentation to reflect the two regions. A Chicken Leg, an enemy seen in Altered Beast and Golden Axe, makes a cameo appearance in the results screen.

Clutch Hitter is considered to be an entry in the Super League series of baseball games, directly inspiring the improvements Pro Yakyuu Super League '91 made to Super League.</desc>

There is an ion shield which provides temporary safety for the colony below, but can be blasted away by alien fire.

Colony 7 is in many ways a combination of two of the most popular shoot 'em up games of the time, containing elements of both Tehkan's Pleiads and Atari's Missile Command. The main innovation of Colony 7 was the extended weaponry arsenal.

It is not clear as to why it was subtitled "The Voyage Through Time", other than the minor tile differences which seem to  attempt to indicate future and past ages: they are labeled as Machine Theme, Pale Green Theme, and Classic Theme.</desc>

		<desc>Commando is a vertically scrolling shoot'em up in which the player takes on the role of a highly trained commando soldier called "Super Joe", who starts the game by being dropped off in a jungle by a helicopter. 

Joe's mission is to rescue captives and destroy the enemy bases and strongholds that appear at the end of each level, killing as many enemy soldiers as possible in the process. 

The end-of-level strongholds see waves of enemy soldiers ordered to attack by a cowardly officer, who immediately runs away. Shooting the fleeing officer earns the player bonus points. Along the way, players can attempt to free prisoners-of-war by shooting their enemy guard escorts as they are transported across the screen.

Super Joe carries only two weapons: a limited-range machine gun with unlimited shots, and a limited supply of hand grenades. Extra grenades can be picked up as the player progresses through the levels.</desc>

The player must 'pit' at the earliest opportunity to get the car repaired, otherwise the fire will spread and the car will eventually explode.

How to Play:
Your Avenger can be moved in 8 directions. The speed increases as it advances, while it decreases as it retreats.
Destroy the front enemy by pressing the Fire Button, and destroy the target below by pressing the Bomb Button.
The enemy UFO will assault you flying either from in front of you or from behind you.  You can locate it by using the radar.
A tough chase missile will pursue your Avenger persistently. Dodge it successfully, and you can cause the enemy to fight among themselves.
When you pass the enemy radar site, an ant-aircraft gun will fire at your according to the altitude of your Avenger.
When the screen advances further, the X station will appear. When you destroy it in good time, you can destroy all the targets appearing on the screen at once. You are then awarded a high score.
Your Avenger will be destroyed when it is affected by any explosion.
The 1st â 5th highest scores for the day can enter their names on the screen.</desc>

		<desc>Strap on your vector spacesuit, and hop into your vector spaceship. It is a good old ship, and it has seen a lot of action. From navigating the asteroid belt and blasting aliens around the sun, to attacking evil space cannons, your little vector ship has done it all, and this time it has been upgraded with twin blasters. You see the ship in Cosmic Chasm seems to be the same spaceship that is in every vector game. You control it using rotation buttons and a thruster button, with a laser and a shield button thrown in for good measure, just like almost every other vector game around.    Now here is what you have to do. You guide your ship through a space fortress room by room. Each room contains a center section that slowly grows and will eventually trap you if you are not fast enough. You can shoot the center section to slow its growth. Each room also contains several exits. One of the exits will always spew forth a bunch of bad guys, shoot them, then exit to go to a different room. Between rooms you get to see an excellent tunnel animation. The idea is to make your way to the center of the fortress, blast the power core, and then leave. There is a map at the top of the screen to keep you from getting lost. This is a pretty decent game. It has a lot more to offer than the one screen of bad guys that most vector games have.</desc>

		<desc>Galivan is a single player platform shoot-em-up in which the player takes on the roll of a 'Cosmo Police' officer who runs and jumps around a multi-directional scrolling cave system, destroying or avoiding waves of constantly attacking robots, aliens and alien ships.

The player starts the game as an unarmed human, whose only attacking options are kicking and punching, but picking up a POW item encases the human in a robotic suit and arms the player with a laser gun.

Collecting the blue POW items while in the suit awards the player with a powerful beam weapon for a limited time, while the red POW item gives the player a three-shot cannon. POW items are dotted throughout the levels and can also be gained by shooting the blue robot aliens.

The player's character has an energy bar that decreases whenever the player is hit. Should this fall below the halfway point, the robot suit will be lost and the player will once again be an unarmed human.

Collecting a POW item while in human form will restore the player's energy. If a POW is collected while wearing the suit, however, the player's energy will NOT be increased but their weapon will receive a power-up.

The game's platforms are littered with springboards that fire the player high into the air when stepped on. Some platforms - often containing POW items - can only be reached via a springboard.</desc>

As you climb up the building, you will be assailed by bald people throwing flowerpots, signs with loose electrical wires, very large apes, falling signs, trash and barbells, and a bird that likes to drop bad things on your character. Your goal is to make it to the top of the building and catch the helicopter, which will transport you to the next building to be scaled. Of course, you will be rewarded for quickly making it up the building by getting a bonus (that is as long as you can catch the helicopter). The things one does for publicity.</desc>

		<desc>Crime Fighters is a beat-em up arcade game where your job is to rescue several women that have been kidnapped by a crime boss and clean up the streets by pummeling as many gang members as possible with your bare hands, as well as anything else you might possibly discover. You will travel through eight levels throughout the city, in locations that range from subways to the docks. 

At the end of every stage is a fight with a boss character, many of whom happen to be knockoffs of famous horror movie antagonists like Freddy Kruger and Jason Voorhees. Scoring is handled by a system wherein you simply get a point for every enemy you kill. Occasionally examples of cartoon physics pop up, such as when your character gets squashed flat by a moving steamroller or a falling billboard.</desc>

		<name>Crossbow</name>
		<desc>Early first-person shoot'em up game with a dungeons and dragons feel about it. Features good speech and screams.

Gameplay requires the player to protect a band of adventurers (referred to as "friends" by the game) from afar by shooting objects that threaten them. The adventurers enter from the left-hand side of the screen and attempt to cross the screen unharmed. If the player helps them reach the opposite side of the screen safely, the adventurers survive to the next scenario, and new adventurers are occasionally granted between scenarios. In addition to the obstacles, the adventurers are vulnerable to the player's shots. The first time the player shoots an adventurer, an on-screen message is shown: "DON'T SHOOT YOUR FRIENDS!" Thereafter, shooting an adventurer will cause him/her to emit a cry of pain, and to walk at a slower pace the rest of the way. A second shot will kill the adventurer.Scenarios are chosen by shooting a destination on a map screen, which include: town, desert, volcano, cave, bridge, jungle, and castle.

The short path to reach the castle is by using the following Color paths -&gt;  Green -&gt; Blue -&gt; Blue -&gt; Red.

The goal is to reach the final scenario, past the castle, in which the player confronts the Masterâwho presumably created the dangers in the game. Defeating the Master of Darkness requires shooting him in the eyes when they turn red (and deadly). The player is treated to a brief congratulation and a challenge to defeat the Master again, but if you dare. Following this screen the player starts over with however many adventurers survived the confrontation.</desc>

There are seven chapters in the game, and each chapter (except one) starts with you entering a merchant's shop and buying weapons using the money that you have collected so far. There are also alternate paths which take you to different parts of the game. At the start of the game, you may choose a chapter (from one to three only) you want to start at.</desc>

		<name>Crossed Swords 2</name>
		<desc>Crossed Swords II is a "Hack 'n Slash" action game released in 1995 by ADK exclusively for the Neo Geo CD. It is the sequel to 1991's Crossed Swords. This version is a bootleg/hack of the CD version to make it playable in the Neo Geo MVS arcade system.

Crossed Swords II features the same gameplay from its predecessor (Crossed Swords on Neo Geo MVS and AES). The player is given a first-person view with a third-person silhouette/wire-frame view of the character similar to the Punch-Out!! arcade game. New to this sequel is the addition of a new button for jumping and dashing, giving the player more maneuverability and allowing him to dodge incoming attacks. By pressing the attack button after dashing the player will make a horizontal slash which stuns enemies briefly, and by pressing the attack button after jumping the player will make a powerful downward slash.

The player can now choose between three characters: the Knight, who is powerful but slow, the Dancer, who is fast but weak, and the Ninja, who has balanced stats. After choosing the character, the player must choose between two game modes: "Nausizz Counterattack" is the main story mode, while "Karividu Arena" is a survival mode where the player fights various enemies consecutively. 

The Story: Decades have passed since the messenger of darkness Nausizz was defeated and peace restored to the kingdom of Belkana. This peace wouldn't last forever, though, as Nausizz's demonic castle has arisen from the depths of hell and his hordes of demons once again threaten the peaceful kingdom with chaos and destruction. Three brave warriors then join together to put and end to Nausizz's reign of terror.</desc>

		<name>Crush Roller</name>
		<desc>Crush Roller is a maze game in which the player controls a paintbrush and must paint the entire layout in order to advance to the next stage. Two fish  one yellow, the other light blue  emerge from separate aquariums to pursue the paintbrush around the board, and if either of the fish succeeds in making contact with the paintbrush, the player loses a life.

The player may use two "rollers" to attack the fish. The rollers are located on two overpasses, one vertical in its orientation, the other horizontal. To use a roller, the player positions the paintbrush on the forward end of the roller, waits for either or both of the fish to approach, then pushes the paintbrush along the roller, attacking the fish. The fish is removed from the maze for a few seconds, then returns to one of the aquariums and resumes its pursuit of the paintbrush. Killing fish in this manner scores bonus points.

A third character, appearing to be an animal or human figure depending on the level, may enter the maze and leave tracks that must be painted over in order for the board to be completed. The player can limit the damage by running over the figure, which not only stops further tracks from being left but also awards the player a score, which progressively increases as more boards are cleared.</desc>

		<name>Crystal Castles</name>
		<desc>Crystal Castles is an inventive variation on the maze-driven collect-the-dots gameplay first seen in Namco's legendary "Pac-Man". The player takes on the role of 'Bentley Bear', who must run around a number of "castles" - each presented in the form of an isometric forced 3D maze - picking up the gemstones that litter its walkways and platforms, before moving onto the next castle. 

Each level is populated by a variety of enemies, including sentient trees, gem eaters, a swarm of bees and Berthilda the Witch. Some enemy types move around the levels randomly, while others will actively chase Bentley. Gem Eaters will devour any gems they reach before the player. 

In addition to four-directional walking, Bentley can also jump to avoid pursuing enemies and obstacles. Many levels have platforms that can only be reached via an elevator and some screens also contain hidden secret passages and ramps, as well as 'warps' that move players forward several levels. 

Jumping over the trees will shrink and temporarily disable them, while wearing Berthilda's red hat grants the player temporary invincibility, allowing them to kill the witch should they manage to catch her. If Bentley Bear touches a Gem Eater while it's in the process of eating a gem, the Gem Eater dies and 500 points are awarded to the player. However, if the Gem Eater is not eating a gem when touched, Bentley Bear dies. 

Some levels contain a large pot of honey. A swarm of bees appears near the honey approximately every five seconds but collecting the honey pot earns the player 1,000 bonus points and causes the bees to appear less frequently. Other enemies, such as the balls, skeletons and ghosts must be avoided. 

If Bentley collects all of the gems on a castle, the player receives bonus points. A bonus is also awarded in the event of the player picking up the last gem on the level. 

Crystal Castles consists of ten different stages broken down into 37 castle mazes (with four castles making up each stage, apart from 10th, which has only one castle).</desc>

The object is to get to the point where the other player started, before they get to where you started. You use a joystick to guide your 'character' through the maze. The game is time based, and you score a point for each maze you beat faster than your opponent (or the computer player if you are going solo). The factory setting is for a 90 second game, but this is operator adjustable. The graphics are done in monochrome white on black. With no detail on anything. The maze walls are only a pixel thick, while the characters themselves (simple shapes), are not much bigger. The mazes are not stylized in anyway. They look exactly like the kind of maze you would do with a paper and pen.</desc>

		<desc>Amidar is an abstract arcade game in which players must 'colour in' all of the rectangles on the screen. Each level has a number of patrolling enemies called 'Amidars' that must be avoided but players are aided in their task with the inclusion of a JUMP button which, when used, causes all the on-screen enemies to jump, giving the player time to escape. There are only three 'jumps' given per level, however.

On odd-numbered levels, the player's character is a gorilla who eats coconuts; on even-numbered levels, it's a paint roller. The game's enemy Amidars are savages and pigs respectively. Whenever a rectangular portion of the board is cleared (either by collecting all surrounding coconuts, or painting all surrounding edges), the rectangle is coloured in and on the even levels, bonus points are awarded, while on the odd-numbered levels, points are awarded for each coconut eaten. 

If players manage to fill in all four corner rectangles of a board, they are briefly able to kill the enemies by touching them (similar to the 'Power-pill' from Namco's Pac-Man series). Enemies killed in this way fall to the bottom of the screen and recover after a few seconds.

On the even-numbered paint roller levels, the roller cannot move too far from grid rectangles that have already been filled without running out of paint and having to return to completed parts of the map to refresh its supply. When this happens, any painted lines that are not part of a filled rectangle will vanish and must be painted again. This means that the player must build their completed squares around the starting point of the level and spread outwards, rather than completing squares on any part of the board as they can on the odd-numbered Gorilla levels. This makes filling in the corner rectangles to become invincible much more difficult.

In between levels players are given the possibility of earning 5,000 bonus points. Here, an Amidar moves across the top of the screen, by pushing the jump button the Amidar traces a random path down towards the bottom of the screen. If the Amidar reaches a bunch of bananas, a bonus is awarded.</desc>

Each stage has a set number of flashing bunches of grapes hanging from platforms and buildings, picking these up temporarily sees the laurel leaves and gown the Roman Emperor is wearing replaced with a roman helmet and tunic. While is this mode the emperor can destroy enemies by jumping on their heads, earning bonus points.</desc>

		<name>Prehistoric Isle in 1930</name>
		<desc>Prehistoric Isle in 1930 is a horizontally scrolling shooting game developed by SNK and released in arcades in 1989. 

Ships have been mysteriously disappearing in the vicinity of the Bahamas for years. Now, in 1930, the United States government sends an expedition to the area in a flying boat to determine the cause. As they survey the ocean, the expedition comes across an uncharted landmass which they dub "Greenhell Isle" and launches two reconnaissance biplanes to take a closer look. As they investigate the island, the biplanes come under attack by dinosaurs and other life forms that were thought to have become extinct millions of years ago. 

The player takes control of a biplane armed with a forward-firing machine gun. It can also be equipped with an option weapon pod that can be rotated clockwise around the craft. The option's attack changes depending on where it is currently positioned:

When directly above or below the plane, the option fires energy waves that reflect back upon contact with a surface.
When diagonally above the plane, the option fires balls of energy that bounce off surfaces at a 45 degree angle.
When diagonally below the plane, the option drops bombs.
When directly in front of the plane, the option replaces the default machine gun with its own flame cannon.
When directly behind the plane, the option deploys aerial mines.</desc>

The goal is to attack the Japanese Air Fleet that bombed the players' American Aircraft Carrier, pursue all Japanese Air and Sea forces, fly through the 16 levels of play, make their way to the Japanese battleship Yamato and destroy her. 11 Levels consist of an Air-to-Sea battle (with a huge battleship or an aircraft carrier as an End-Level Boss), while 5 levels consist of an all-aerial battle against a squadron of Japanese Bombers and a Mother Bomber that needs to be destroyed.
As in 1942, players pilot a P-38. Two buttons are used: one for regular attacks (with several weapons) and one for special actions that executes either a loop like in 1942 or one of three special attacks that damage the plane. Unlike 1942, the player only has one life, with one refillable energy meter. Destroying a complete formation of red enemy planes will result in a power-up, such as a health boost or a temporary special weapons which replaces the default twin gun.</desc>

		<name>720 Degrees</name>
		<desc>A one or two-player arcade game with players taking on the role of a skateboarder, and must perform various tricks and maneuvers to earn the points and tickets needed to compete for medals in the game's numerous skate parks. 

The bulk of the action takes place in a 'Skate City', a small urban area made up of ramps, jumps and hazards. Players can skate anywhere they wish as they perform the tricks and jumps needed to reach the score thresholds that will earn them entry tickets to Skate City's skate parks to compete for medals and cash prizes. 

Each score threshold must be reached and a park entered within a tight time limit. Failure to do so sees the skater persued by a swarm of bees and the words SKATE OR DIE appear. Should the bees touch the skater before he enters a park, the game ends. Skate City's roads and pavements are populated with moving traffic and pedestrians and any collision with them will result in the skater being knocked from his board, costing the player precious seconds. 

The parks themselves each feature one of four different disciplines: Slalom, Jump, Downhill and Ramp. Each park has a timer and players can earn either a bronze, silver or gold medal - together with a cash prize - depending on how quickly the park is completed. If the park target score or finish line is not reached before the timer expires, no medal or money is awarded. 

Money won can be used to buy equipment upgrades from the stalls that litter Skate City. Players can buy upgraded boards, helmets, pads and shoes. Boards give faster speed; helmets allow for more risky maneuvers; pads give a faster recovery from falls and shoes provide more height on jumps, as well as giving a quicker standing start. 

At the start of each new game, players can select from one of two play modes. 'Training Level' is available for beginners and gives players numerous playing hints and tips. 'Experienced Level' is more challenging as well as offering fewer hints. It does, however, include the 'add-a-coin' feature, which allows for awards and items already won to be carried over to a new game. 

The main objective is to compete in as many skate parks as possible. There are numerous city hazards to be avoided, such as BMX riders, cars, Frisbee throwers and other skaters. To guide the player around Skate City are map tiles. Riding over one of these will temporaily pause the action and display the layout of the city, including the locations of the skate parks and equipment stalls.

		<name>Alien Arena</name>
		<desc>Player 1 (Thor) and Player 2 (Zespar) are battling it out in the Alien Arena. The game is timed, with 2 minutes for every 25 cents inserted, regardless of your choice of 1-player or 2-player. More time can be purchased at any time before the timer reads ':00'.

In a 1-player game you are Thor, with controls on the right, and the computer plays Zespar, on the left. In a 2-player game each of you chooses a set of controls. When time runs out in either game, it reverts to a "play as long as you can keep alive and possibly winning extra lives" 1-player game. If it started as a 2-player game, whoever is winning when time runs out is the one who gets to battle the computer.

The basic theme of the game is "capture the flag (while protecting your own)". You can assemble offensive and defensive aids by picking up 'pieces' strewn about your half of the playfield. The pieces are color-coded, randomly created and distributed, and different objects require different numbers of pieces to assemble. Once you start assembling an object, you must finish assembling it (pick up enough pieces for it) and place it... or 'flush' the pieces you've picked up so far. Flush is mostly used for when you accidentally picked up the wrong color piece... or when you don't have the required pieces to assemble the rest of the object. A status bar shows what object is under construction, and how many more pieces are needed. Only one object can be assembled at a time. Once it is assembled, you must carry it to where you want to place or launch it and press the 'place' button.

There is a delay at the beginning of each round before the flags appear, and then a further delay before the midfield barrier comes down. Use this time to start assembling an offense or defense or both (this keeps the opponent from just starting each round by making a suicide dash for your flag). When the flags do appear, their placement is random, but within a small distance from the back wall of your half of the arena.

A round ends when an opposing flag is captured by a player, or when a player is destroyed by one of his opponent's offensive or defensive objects. There are all sorts of nuances to how the objects behave, how they score, etc.</desc>

		<desc>A strange and hugely abstract beat-em-up for one or two players, in which circus clowns take to the streets to beat up other circus performers; as well as lawyers, maintenance workers, and other assorted professionals.

In addition to the standard beat-em-up kick and punch moves, the clowns can use their 'clown equipment' against their enemies; using items such as spring-loaded boxing gloves, bottles of soda water and, of course, cream pies.</desc>

A new feature to this game that old-school KOF fans might have trouble getting used to is the new interchangeable team system. You still pick three characters and decide your character order before a match, but now you have the option to change to another character during a match. You can change at any time during a match, but you cannot when two of your teammates have been taken out, and only one character is left in reserve.</desc>

The story is that the princess has been kidnapped by the villains of the Insect World, and Zippy Bug has to rescue her. After shooting the enemies, they drop fruits that the player can collect for extra points, and skulls that are deadly if touched. The player is able to fly for a short time, and every time this is done, one of the letters from the 'I Love You' at the bottom of the screen is used up. The letters regenerate over a small period of time. There are also other items, such as the key, which surrounds the player in a bubble and makes him invulnerable to 1 hit. Another item is a ring which seems to instantly replenish all of the used up 'I Love You' letters. One other item is the hammer, which allows the player to wipe out all the enemies off the screen. There is a boss at the end of each level.</desc>

		<name>R-Type</name>
		<desc>RType is a sideways-scrolling shoot-em-up in which the evil Bydo Empire rules the galaxy through fear and intimidation and it's up to the player - piloting their heavily-armed R-9 space ship - to battle through eight tough levels to the heart of the Bydo stronghold and defeat them.

The game's revolutionary weapons system is its real stroke of genius. The first of numerous innovations that R?Type bought to the genre is the beam weapon: when the fire button is held down, a 'power meter' starts to charge up; once the meter is full, releasing the fire button unleashes a very powerful plasma burst capable of inflicting much greater damage to enemy ships or even destroying numerous enemies simultaneously. The trade-off is that charging the weapon takes up valuable seconds, giving the Bydo ships time to attack.

The most significant addition to R-type's arsenal is the now-legendary 'Force Pod'. This takes the form of an invincible, detachable laser-firing pod that can be attached to either the front or rear of the player's ship, or can be detached completely, after which the pod sits some distance either ahead or behind the player's ship, tracking its movements and providing additional fire power. When attached to the R9 ship, the pod acts as a shield. This forms a crucial part of R?Type's gameplay and has to be fully utilised to navigate certain sections of the game, such as the huge mothership that comprises the game's 3rd stage.

R?Type's levels are designed to make full use of its unique weapons system, making for very linear and demanding gameplay in which losing or picking up the wrong weapon at the wrong time often leads to an instant death. Its intelligent, precise and demanding level design, gave the world its first truly 'strategic' shoot-em-up.</desc>

		<name>Rampage</name>
		<desc>Rampage is a classic B-movie inspired smash-em-up in which up to three players take on the roles of three mutated monsters - George the giant ape, Lizzie the giant lizard and Ralph the giant wolf - who move from city to city destroying skyscrapers and vehicles, while eating or killing any people that get in their way. 

The monsters' health can be damaged in a number of ways: by being shot by National Guardsmen, by being hit by another monster, by falling from a building, by being hit by police cars or tanks, by going underwater, by being struck by lightning, or by eating something bad, such as dynamite. Health is replenished by eating food found in damaged buildings. 

If the players' health gauge diminishes completely, the monsters will revert back to their original human form and walk sideways off the screen. Rampage has a "buy back in" option, however; if players chose to continue the game before the human figure leaves the play area, the game will continue from that stage. 

Rampage is set over the course of 128 days in cities across North America. The game starts in Peoria, Illinois and ends in Plano, Illinois. In Plano, players receive a mega vitamin bonus which heals all the monsters and provides a large point bonus. After this, the cycle of cities repeats five times. After 768 days, the game resets back to Day One. 

Examples of bonuses and hazards found inside damaged buildings: 
Food: Milk, Turkey, Hot Toast, Fruit 
Bonus: Flower Pot, TV Set, Money Bag 
Hazard: Cactus, Poison, Toaster 

Examples of bonuses and hazards found outside damaged buildings: 
Bonus: Auto (or Truck), Commuter Train, Person in Manhole 
Hazard: National Guard Tank, Police Car, Storm Cloud 

Further bonus points can be earned by grabbing a fleeing 'Townie' from a building window. This has two benefits: 1) While holding the Townie, all swat team members disappear from the building windows and 2) accumulating points are scored during the time the Townie is held.</desc>

		<name>Green Beret</name>
		<desc>Green Beret is a sideways-scrolling action/platform game set during the Cold War, in which a US Special Forces Marine must infiltrate a Russian military base to save four POW's from being executed by firing squad. 

Initially, the soldier is armed with only a combat knife, but by killing the certain enemy troops, players can obtain either a three-shot flamethrower, a four-shot RPG, or a three-pack of hand grenades. 

The Marine can jump or lie down to avoid the enemy bullets, as well as climbing ladders to avoid enemies and projectiles, as well as the flashing land mines that litter the levels. While it's possible to remain still in one area to rack up points, if players take too long to proceed, the game will start sending out tougher enemies and eventually a stealth-like bomber will appear to take out the player. There is also an unseen time limit that will kill off players if they take too long to complete the stage. 

The game has four stages in total: a missile base, a harbour, an air Base and a Siberian POW Camp. At the end of each stage the Marine will face a group of enemies specific to that stage: Stage 1 ends with a truckload of running and jump-kicking soldiers, Stage 2 with a pack of fierce dogs and their handlers, Stage 3 with three Gyro-copters and Stage 4 with a number of multi-shot flamethrower operators. 

The game is completed once the captives have been rescued at the end of the fourth stage, after which the action starts over with an increased level of difficulty.</desc>

		<name>Mortal Kombat</name>
		<desc>Mortal Kombat, first in the Mortal Kombat series, is a 1-on-1 fighting game featuring a cast of seven different characters. Mortal Kombat took ideas from Capcom's seminal Street Fighter II, such as the game's special moves and projectiles. It also introduced a cast of photo-realistic digitized fighters for players to fight either as or against. 

Mortal Kombat characters list:
JOHNNY CAGE
KANO
RAIDEN
LIU KANG
SCORPION
SUB-ZERO
SONYA BLADE

Battles are fought over the best of three rounds. At the end of a battle, a voice instructs the winner to 'Finish Him/Her!' and players have only a couple of seconds to try and execute their character's 'fatality', which sees the winner killing the loser in a spectacular and grisly fashion.</desc>

		<desc>Arkanoid - Revenge of DOH © 1987 Taito Corp.

The mysterious enemy known as 'DOH' has returned to seek vengeance on the 'Vaus' space vessel. The player must once again take control of the Vaus and overcome many challenges in order to destroy DOH once and for all. 

An update of the popular 1986 original, Revenge of DOH sees the player battle through 34 rounds, taken from a grand total of 64. Revenge of DOH differs from its predecessor with the introduction of "Warp Gates". Upon completion of a round or when the Break ('B') pill is caught, two gates appear at the bottom left and bottom right of the play area respectively, the Vaus is then taken through one of the gates - the choice will affect which version of the next round is provided.

The game also features two new features for bricks. Notched silver bricks, like normal silver bricks, take several hits to destroy. However, after a short period of time after destruction, they regenerate at full strength. Fortunately, clearing a level does not require that any notched bricks to be destroyed. Also, some bricks move from side to side as long as their left and/or right sides are not obstructed by other bricks.

The game features a mini-boss in the form of a giant brain, which will help you practice for DOH. You must aim for the brain's mouth to defeat it.</desc>

		<name>Pac-Land</name>
		<desc>Pac-Land is a horizontally-scrolling platform game set in the cartoon world of the game's title. A fairy has lost her way and needs Pac-Man to help her get back to her home of Fairyland. Pac-Man, with the fairy safely hidden beneath his hat, must run and jump through the colourful world until he reaches and enters the magical door to Fairyland. Upon being rescued, the fairy gives Pac-Man a pair of magical shoes for his trip back home. These enable him to jump wherever he wants, without the need for a platform to jump from. This effectively means Pac-Man can 'sky-jump' back home if he so wishes.

Directional buttons make Pac-Man walk left and right and it's possible to make him run by tapping the desired directional button twice. Pac-Man is pursued by his ever-present enemies in the form of five ghosts - Pinky, Inky, Blinky, Clyde and Sue. Pac-Man must avoid the ghosts and other deadly objects that populate the levels. As with previous games in the series, a small number of 'Powerpills' appear. Eating a Powerpill makes Pac-Man temporarily invincible and turns the ghosts purple and vulnerable to being eaten. On some stages, Pac-Man must use a springboard to jump over large ponds by leaping from the springboard and rapidly moving left and right while in the air.

The game's stages are called 'trips', with players able to start on any one of the first five. Each trip made up of four rounds (three rounds to reach Fairyland and one round to return home) with a short interval between each one. The objective in all trips is to get the fairy safely back to Fairyland then return home to Pac-Man's family. The majority of the trip involves moving from left to right, avoiding various obstacles such as the enemy ghosts, water spurts and quicksand traps. The journey home, however, scrolls right to left.

Each stage must be completed within a set time limit and if the player runs out of time before finishing a round, Sue (the purple ghost) will speed up considerably and kill Pac-Man. At the end of each round, players are awarded bonus points based on how much of the time limit remains. On each stage, cherries and other items can be collected for extra points. There are a total of 8 different trips in the game, totalling 32 levels. After the 8th trip, the 9th trip is a repeat of the 5th trip, with level 33 effectively being level 17, with an increased difficulty level.</desc>

		<desc>Space Fury is a rather simple alien blasting shoot-em-up. It uses almost industry standard vector controls, which are four buttons, Left Rotate, Right Rotate, Thrust, and Fire. You begin the game in the center of four strange looking shapes. These shapes are both level selects and upgrades. Run into one of them and it will add itself to your ship, and then you get to do the level associated with it. Each level is different mainly because you have wildly different shot patterns on each one. But all of them are the same when it comes to your objective. What you have to do is blast all the spaceship parts before they can form into dangerous enemy spaceships. Blast them all, and you get to select a new level and watch a little interlude where the alien taunts you with his evil computer voice.

		<name>Star Wars</name>
		<desc>Star Wars is a single-player 3-D shoot-em-up based on the legendary movie franchise of the same name. This game is specifically based on the very first Star Wars movie, 'Episode IV: A New Hope'. The player takes on the role of Luke Skywalker (Red Five) whose goal is to blow up the infamous "Death Star" by firing a Proton Torpedo into an exposed exhaust port situated on the Death Star's surface. 

Before reaching the exhaust port, players must survive three attack phases. 

PHASE 1: The game begins in outer space above the Death Star. Players must engage in a dog fight with Darth Vader and numerous enemy TIE Fighters. All but Vader's fighter can be shot and destroyed. Incoming enemy fire must be avoided or shot to prevent damage to the player's Deflector shields. 

PHASE 2: The X-Wing flies down to the surface of the Death Star and is confronted with a barrage of laser turrets and towers as the X-Wing flies across the Death Star's surface. Any collisions with either the towers or incoming enemy shots will cause damage to the player's Deflector Shields. 

The laser tower tops have a progressive scoring incentive that is displayed at the top center of the screen, along with the number of remaining laser tower tops that need to be destroyed before the X-Wing enters the exhaust port trench. If the player manages to destroy all of the towers, a sizeable point bonus is awarded. 

PHASE 3: The X-Wing begins its approach down the trench of the Death Star, heading for the exhaust port situated at the end of the trench. The trench walls are lined with red laser-gun turrets that fire at the player as he makes his approach. Incoming fire must either be avoided or shot. Trench catwalks of varying shapes and heights also appear in later trench runs. These must be avoided as any collision results in damage to Red 5's deflector shields. 

If the player survives the trench run, the voice of 'Han Solo' will advise that 'You're all clear, Kid' and the player must quickly shoot the exhaust port to destroy the Death Star. If a trench run is completed without the player having fired any shots other than the shot into the exhaust port, a sizeable point bonus is awarded for 'using the force'. If the exhaust port is missed, Red 5 will plough through the wall at the end of the trench and lose one deflector shield, after which the trench run will start over. 

If the player succeeds in blowing up the Death Star, Red 5 makes its escape before turning to view the colourful explosion. Bonus points for Remaining Shield Energy is now scored. 

The player is then returned to the fray and whole process begins again. Each successive Death Star run greatly increases in difficulty; TIE Fighters shoot more often, there are more Laser towers and batteries in successive rounds and there are many more obstacles and laser fire during the trench run.</desc>

		<name>Double Dragon II - The Revenge</name>
		<desc>Following his defeat at the end of the original Double Dragon, Willy, the leader of the Black Warriors, retaliates against Billy and Jimmy Lee by murdering their friend, Marian, leaving the brothers with the task to avenge her death.

The sequel to Double Dragon is essentially an upgraded version of the original game, but with with a two-way attacking system similar to one previously used in Technos Japan's 1986 arcade game "Renegade". Many of the attacks and combos from the original "Double Dragon" are retained, as well as new techniques including the invincible Cyclone Kick.

The stages and weapons are redesigned versions of items previously featured in the original game. There are a few new traps such as a bulldozer in the middle of Mission 3 and all of the transition sequences between stages are now done with the character entering the next level via a lift, making it impossible to carry one weapon to the next area.

Most of the enemy characters return from the original Double Dragon, with some given facelifts, but the stage bosses are all new. The enemies are as followed:
Williams - Has a wilder face and longer hair. He can now run towards the player and do cartwheels. He throws his knives in mid-air and sometimes carry a shovel which he throws towards the player.
Rowper - Has a beard and eye-patch, but otherwise is more or less identical to his original self. He carries shovels and can sometime pick up large objects.
Linda - She now has a mohawk and face paint. She can also jump off platforms and do the elbow strike against the player. In addition to the ball and chain, she also carries grenades and knives.
Oharra - A strongman with a clean-shaved face. Replaces Abobo from the first game and has the same attacks.
Bolo - A head-swap of Oharra with long hair and beard. Replaces the mohawked head-swap of Abobo from the first game.
Jeff - Same as his original self, but now carries grenades.
Burnov - The boss of Mission 1. An obese wrestler whose face is concealed with a mask. He grabs the player and throws similar punches in the face. After dying, he will stand up and yell, disappearing in front of the player and leaving only his clothes. In later encounters, he will revive himself at least once.
Abore - The boss of Mission 2. A huge suspender-wearing strongman with Terminator-like sunglasses. His slaps and shoulder tackles do massive damage to the player.
Chin Taimei - The boss of Mission 3. A Chinese martial artists armed with twin kali sticks. In addition to his energy-draining stick combo, he also has a jump kick and sweep kick.
Willy - The boss of Mission 4. Looks like he does in the original game, but now dresses in red. He still uses the same machine gun from the first game.
The clone - After defeating Willy, the player will have to fight their character's evil self. This clone has all the techniques the player has, but can also throw energy beams and possess the player's body to drain his energy.</desc>

Keep the galaxy safe for all its sinizens! Fiendish Worker ships from the planet Sporg will attempt to fabricate a Sinistar from the remains of derelict planetoids in your very sector. You must not let them do this for two reasons: 
1) These planetoids contain the life-sustaining crystals that your civilization requires for its vital technologies. 
2) With the eminently unstable Sinistar in their possession, the Sprogites can lay waste to any civilization in your sector. You alone stand in their way. 

You must mine the sinisite crystals. Williams has equipped you with the latest heuristic electret cannon technology. All you need to do is aim at a planetoid and shoot. Now collect your motherlode! 

In fact, only with sinisite can you manufacture sinibombs to eradicate the Sinistar. But you must also rebuff the Workers and disintegrate their even more aggressive comrades-at-arms, the evil skelomorphic Warriors! Intelligent beings everywhere depend on your courage, your dedication, your reserve, your shrewd command of tactical invention! It's up to you, space cadet!</desc>

The game is a sequel to the legendary "Robotron: 2084" and like its prequel, utilises a dual joystick control system, with the left stick controlling player movement and the right controlling the direction of fire. 

Enemy waves enter each arena from four directions via open doorways and all must be killed before players can progress to the next stage. Some arenas feature static gun emplacements set into a wall that must also be destroyed. Power-ups that improve weapons, speed and armour appear at regular intervals, although each only lasts for a limited time.

Smash TV is broken down into stages, each with a set number of arenas. Tough end-of-level bosses await at the end of each stage. As well as the prizes and power-ups, keys can be collected and if enough have been picked up by the end of the game, players can access a bonus level called the Pleasure Dome.</desc>

		<name>10-Yard Fight</name>
		<desc>The game is viewed in a top-down perspective and is vertical scrolling. The player does not select plays for either offense or defense. On offense, the player simply receives the ball upon the snap and either attempt to run with the quarterback, toss the ball to a running back, or throw the ball to the one long distance receiver - basically the option offense. On defense, the player chooses one of two players to control, and the computer manipulates the others. The ball can also be punted or a field goal can be attempted.
10-Yard Fight has five levels of difficulty; from easiest to most difficult: high school, college, professional, playoff, and Super Bowl. If the player wins both halves of an "accelerated real time" 30-minute half at an easier level, the player advanced to the next level of difficulty, like a career mode.</desc>

		<desc>Asteroids © 1979 Atari, Incorporated.

Asteroids is a legendary, genre defining game - in an era replete with genre-defining classics - in which a single player takes control of a spaceship trapped in the middle of an asteroid belt. A number of large, slow-moving asteroids drift randomly around the play area and must be shot by the player. When shot, the asteroids will break into a number of smaller pieces which must also be shot until eventually, all of the asteroids and fragments will be destroyed and the next wave begins. 

Asteroids introduced real-world physics to video games for the first time, with speed and inertia all adding to the player's problems. As well as the inertia of the player's ship - forcing the player to allow for the ship slowing down and speeding up whenever the Thrust button was utilized - shot asteroids would often send fragments flying in seemingly random directions, and at varying and unpredictable speeds. 

As well as the ever-present asteroids, flying saucers also make a regular appearance. These move horizontally and diagonally around the screen, firing at the player's ship, and must be quickly destroyed. They are destroyed when hit by the player's shot, when hit by a saucer's shot or when they collide with an asteroid. 

CAST OF CHARACTERS - 

Spaceship - This is you, the player. You can rotate 360 degrees, fire bullets, thrust forward in any direction, and hyperspace to safety if you feel you are in danger. 

Large Asteroid - These are the large rocks that fill the screen at the beginning of each stage. Hitting one with a bullet will break it apart into two Medium Asteroids. 

Medium Asteroid - Slightly smaller than Large Asteroids, but faster moving. Shooting one of these will result in two Small Asteroids. 

Small Asteroid - These are the smallest and fastest rocks on the screen. If a bullet hits one of these, it will vaporize. 

Large Saucer - Large flying saucers appear on the screen from time to time, randomly firing shots around the screen. They pose a minor threat. 

Small Saucer - The smaller flying saucers are deadlier than the large variety. They are much more precise with their shots, and are more likely to kill you. Eliminate them quickly or get out of their range.</desc>

		<name>Mortal Kombat 2</name>
		<desc>Mortal Kombat II is a direct sequel to the 1992 original featuring new fighters (increasing the character roster from 7 to 12) and improved graphics. 

As with its predecessor, MKII's matches are divided into rounds, with victory awarded to the first player to win two rounds. At the point of defeat, the losing fighter will become dazed and the winner is given the opportunity to execute a 'finishing move'. 

Some of the standard fighting moves (moves shared by all characters) have now been expanded or enhanced. A crouching punch has been added and the 'roundhouse kick' is more powerful and now knocks opponents across the screen. Also, the difference in hit boxes between high and low kicks is now more marked. 

Additionally, returning characters gain new special moves and MKII marks the first appearence of multiple Fatalities - as well as additional, non-lethal finishing moves - in the series. In addition to the Fatalities of its predecessor, MKII offers 'Babalities' (turning a defeated opponent into a crying baby), 'Friendships' (a non-malicious interaction, such as dancing or giving a gift to the defeated opponent) and stage-specific Fatalities (the winner uppercutting their opponent into an abyss below, spikes above, or a pool of acid in the background). 

Each character still shares generic attributes - speed, power, jump height and airtime - albeit with differing hit boxes. The sequel drops the points system of its prequel in favour of a consecutive win tally.</desc>

		<name>Asteroids Deluxe</name>
		<desc>Asteroids Deluxe is a 1 or 2-player game with an X-Y or vector-generator monitor. The game depicts a third-person view of a player's spaceship battling to destroy asteroids, flying saucers and enemy ships or 'death stars' (shaped like clusters of triangles). When hit, the asteroids and death stars will break into progressively smaller pieces. 

Players can put up an octagon-shaped 'shield' to temporarily protect their spaceship. However, this shield wears out with use. 

Large asteroids appear and drift in from the outer edges of the display. By pressing the ROTATE LEFT and ROTATE RIGHT pushbuttons on the control panel, the player may aim a spaceship toward any of the asteroids. The player uses the FIRE pushbutton to shoot at the asteroids and other objects. 

When shot, each large asteroid divides into two medium-sized asteroids, and the game adds 20 points to the player's score. Medium-sized asteroids, when shot, divide into two small-sized asteroids, and the game awards 50 points to the player. When shot the smallest asteroid disappears and the game adds 100 points to the player's score. 

In addition to asteroids, the players can score points for shooting the various enemy ships. When hit, the large ships ('death stars' shaped like hexagons) score 50 points and break into three diamond shapes. The medium-sized enemy or diamond, when hit, grants the player 100 points and breaks into two small triangular pieces. These small pieces disappear when the player hits them, and the score increases by 200 points. 

At any time during game play, a flying saucer may appear from either side of the display. The game awards players 200 points for shooting a large saucer and 1,000 points for a small saucer (the latter is a smaller target for players, though not any faster moving than the large one. It also shoots more accurately). 

The player's objective in the game is to shoot and destroy as many asteroids, saucers, and enemy ships as possible before all his or her spaceships are destroyed. A ship is destroyed if an asteroid, saucer or enemy ship smashes into it, or if a flying saucer shoots it. To prevent losing a ship, the player may press the THRUST pushbutton to move out of the path of an oncoming object. 

As an emergency maneuver, a player can press the Shields button. An octagon will then appear around the player's ship as protection from all enemies. For challenge the shield power lasts only about 10 seconds, but the power is renewed with each ship. The amount of shielding power available is shown by the brightness of the octagon (dim means almost exhausted power).

Your mission is to guard various space outposts from hordes of incoming enemy ships. Each level will have several outposts all clustered together in the center. If an enemy ship touches an outpost, then the outpost is destroyed. You can activate a long range scanner by using your second button. This allows you to locate enemies before they get close, that way you can fly off and get them before they even have a shot at the outposts.</desc>

		<desc>Battletoads is a (mostly) horizontally-scrolling beat-em-up in which up to three players take on the roles of Rash, Pimple, or Zitz and must punch and kick their way through six enemy-infested stages to save their alternate universe from the Dark Queen.

The Toads each vary in fighting style: Rash is nimble, Pimple is burly and strong, and Zitz is a balance of the two. Each Toad also has its own signature exaggerated power and attack, in which their limbs turn into objects such as axes and drills.

In a visually unique twist, the Toads can knock the game's enemies 'off-screen' so that they appear to fly towards the players, breaking the fourth wall. Enemies include aliens, mutant rodents and snowmen.

The game's stages, in addition to having their own unique visual theme, often differ in gameplay style. Some levels are Double Dragon-style 2.5D brawlers, while others are strictly two-dimensional, platform-like stages. In one level, the Toads wear jet-packs and descend a tunnel and in the final level, the Toads shoot enemies from a vehicle.</desc>

		<desc>Biomechanical Toy is an eightway-scrolling platform shoot-em-up set in a world of magically-animated toys, in which the magical pendulum that animates the toys has been stolen by the evil 'Scrubby', a criminal once imprisoned for trying to steal the pendulum who has managed to escape and take his revenge. The player takes on the role of Inguz and is tasked with freeing the few remaining good toys that are trapped throughout the stages, while destroying or avoiding the many evil toys that now patrol the kingdom. 

Inguz carries a basic, single-firing pistol, although additional ammo clips can be found throughout the game that upgrade the gun with either extra shot power, automatic firing or exploding bullets. When the gun's current ammo clip is empty, Inguz will take a moment to reload, leaving him vulnerable to attack. Freed toys will give help to Inguz by providing additional firepower for a short time.

Inguz begins each stage and each new life with a full health meter of eighty units, but food can be found that will replenish the meter. The player can lose a life either by running out of health, falling off the bottom of the screen (or into a hazard, such as a lava pit), or by running out of time. Clearing each stage awards bonus points based on both remaining time and health units.

Checkpoints - indicated by red flags - are located at certain points throughout the stages. In the event of losing a life, play restarts from the last checkpoint reached. Objects with Inguz's face on them (such as wooden chests and balloons) release bonus items when shot. 

An abstract, oriental-looking face occasionally forms part of a level's platform which, when shot, releases balloons which can in turn be shot for bonus items. A giant flying hat also occasionally appears and will drop bonus items when shot. Smart Bombs can also be found at certain points that, when run into by Inguz, will damage or destroy all enemy toys on screen.</desc>

		<name>Blasteroids</name>
		<desc>Blasteroids is a 1 or 2-player update of Atari's seminal "Asteroids", where the object of the game is to clear all sectors of the asteroids and enemy ships. Once this task is completed, the player goes on to battle Mukor - the "boss" asteroid who rules all galaxies - and destroy him.

The player's ship appears first in the center of four vortices, he or she must chose which vortex they wish to enter, which then transports them to a sector of their chosen star system.

Unlike in "Asteroids", the player ship has a finite amount of fuel which must be replenished as often as possible. This is achieved by destroying specifically-colored asteroids which turn into collectible crystals. Not all sectors contain the crystal-bearing asteroids, however, and if the player runs out of fuel, a ship is lost. The game contains three different ship configurations and the player can switch between them at any time during a level. The three configurations are: Speeder (small and fast, but weak), Fighter (medium speed and strength) and Warrior (large and strong but very slow).

BloodStorm was dubbed as a possible MK-killer in an attempt to surpass rival Midway's success with Mortal Kombat, though it did not prevail. It was the last game Strata produced before the company went out of business.

As with its predecessor Time Killers, BloodStorm features many of the aspects carried down from it, such as the removal of an opponent s arms and an instant kill attack, as well as a Special Death Move. The button layout is virtually the same. They are labeled as "back leg", "front leg", "back arm" and "front arm" respectively. A button in the center is used to make the character block. As one would suspect, if a particular limb is lost in combat, its corresponding button is rendered useless.

Two years later, a terrorist organization calling themselves Red Falcon takes over the island as part of their plot to invade the Earth. Bill Rizer and Lance Bean, of the Contra unit, are sent to the Oceania island to stop the evil threat.

'Contra' is a hectic one or two player platform shoot-em-up featuring 10 stages. In addition to the standard side-view levels, there are also "3D maze" stages in which the player must proceed through a series of corridors inside an enemy base, destroying various sensors, in order to reach the core of the base.

Each player's character is equipped with a semi-automatic machine gun with an unlimited amount of ammunition and can jump, move and fire in all eight cardinal directions. Players can also move and jump simultaneously while firing. Co-ordination of the character's movement is essential as a single hit from any enemy, bullet, or other hazard will instantly kill the player's character and also eliminate the current weapon from the player's inventory.

20 light years from Earth lies the planet of Andres, a peaceful and civilised place. In the year A.C. 2016 Andres experienced a solar eclipse that lasted for over three months. All living creatures were exposed to a strange, dark red light and many began to mutate in both appearance and character. Few inhabitants would survive the torture inflicted by these crazed mutants. 

A lucky few escaped and lived in exile. Four of the survivers decided to join forces, to fight back and overthrow the evil that dominates the planet.

		<name>Double Dragon</name>
		<desc>Double Dragon is a side-scrolling beat-em-up for one or two players, featuring twin brothers and martial arts masters, "Billy &amp; Jimmy Lee". The brothers must defeat the savage street gang known as the 'Black Warriors' to rescue Billy's kidnapped girlfriend, Marian. Standing between the brothers and Marian are four huge, colorful and varied levels; each populated with a wide variety of thugs.

Many of the game's enemies carry weapons (knives, baseball bats etc.) and should Billy or Jimmy manage to knock the weapons from the enemies' hands, the heroes can pick the weapons up and use them against the enemies.

The Black Warriors is made up of six distinct enemy characters- plus Willy, the game's final boss - with each differing in both physical appearance and fighting style. The members of the Black Warriors consist of the following fighters: 
Williams - A street punk in a tank top. In addition to the standard punches and jump kicks, his signature technique is a body blow to the stomach. He also wields weapons such as baseball bats, knives and dynamite sticks.
Rowper - A punk who wears matching-colored pants and shirtless vest. He wields all the same weapons as Williams, but can also lift and throw heavy objects such as oildrums, boxes and stones.
Linda - Female punk who usually carries a whip. She's not very strong, as she falls down to ground with a couple of punches or a single kick (because of this, she is the only regular-sized enemy who cannot be placed on a headlock).
Abobo - A tall, big-muscled bald guy. His attacks includes punches, a standing kick and a body toss. He can also lift and throw heavy objects like Rowper. Due to his large size, he cannot be put into a headlock.
Boss 1 - The first boss, a head-swap of Abobo with a Mr. T-style mohawk and beard. Fights just like Abobo, only with an added double-handed slap. Unlike Abobo, he does not use weapons. A green version of him appears as the Mission 3 boss.
Boss 2 - The second boss. A head swap of the player who uses almost all the same techniques. 
Willy - The game's final boss, armed, somewhat unfairly, with a machine-gun.

Double Dragon was a huge success due to the many game-play innovations it brought to the genre (see TRIVIA for details), but it demonstrates its final moment of inspired genius at the very end of the game. Should both players still be alive after the final boss has been defeated, they will then have to fight each OTHER. The winner of this fight will be the one who wins Marian's affections.</desc>

		<desc>Escape From The Planet of the Robot Monsters © 1989 Atari Games Corp.

Escape From The Planet Of The Robot Monsters is a one or two-player game in which the players must rescue Dr. Sarah Bellum from Planet X, where her research facility has been taken over by the evil Reptilons. The game is played from an isometric perspective where players control their avatars using Hall effect joysticks. The Hall effect is the production of a voltage difference (the Hall voltage) across an electrical conductor, transverse to an electric current in the conductor and a magnetic field perpendicular to the current. It was discovered by Edwin Hall in 1879.

The player must shoot their way through a series of simple maze-like levels, releasing the human hostages along the way. Levers must be found and thrown to activate the escalators which allow access to new areas. Gems can be collected to increase the power of the player's ray gun, and food lockers may be broken into for a health boost.

At the end of each level the play switches to an isometric auto-scrolling sequence in which the player controls his character in a small spaceship, and must steer left or right to navigate through a maze of obstacles. If the player reaches the end of this sequence they will progress to the next level.</desc>

		<name>Galaga '88</name>
		<desc> By destroying special enemies or obstacles the player can get 'items'. When a player has two items, they can warp to another dimension to confront more Galagan ships with new strategies. In the Challenging Stages (labelled in this game as 'That's Galactic Dancin'), the player shoots down as many invaders as possible as the Galagans dance to a waltz, tango, march or jazz tune. 

The player selects single or dual ship power. The objective is to destroy all the Galagan foes in each of the 29 sectors of the galaxy, with each sector more difficult than the last. 

Unique Features: 
More opponents. In addition to Boss, Goei and Zako, the original Galagan crew, Don, Nin, Ban, and Gan have been added. Each of the Galagans has a unique way of challenging the players. 
Different types of ships. Players can choose single or dual ships (if the game option is set for dual and single). When the player retrieves a dual ship from the Boss's tractor beam, it turns into a triple ship with ten times the power of a single ship. 
Challenging Stages. In the 'That's Galactic Dancin' stages, the Galagan invaders dance to a waltz, tango, Sousa march or jazz tune, while the player shoots down Galagans to earn bonus points. 
Warping to a new dimension. By destroying particular enemies or obstacles and capturing two of their items, the player can warp to the next dimension. 
Player challenge. Each dimension has different mix of Galagans with different strategies to be overcome. 
Win back captured ships. The player can win back ships captured in the Boss Galaga's tractor beam. When the player destroys the Boss, the ships are released. If the player retrieves them, the ships become dual ships if they were single and triple if they were dual. 
High Score Mode. Upon completing a game, a player can enter his initials if they are among the top eight scorers on the game.</desc>

The same hockey rules apply, pass the puck around around the ice rink and shoot it past the opposite goalie to score. You can also check your opponent just like real hockey, only each character has their own bone-crushing way of checking, each with maximum impact and zero tolerance for your well-being.  Players can also start fights with one another to really spice things up.

For an additional credit, players can purchase a 'power drink' that will make them 'Skate Faster and Shoot Harder' at the start of the period for one minute.

Now get to the action and DROP THAT PUCK!</desc>

Centuries later, however, the world government had sent colonists to Mars which began to solve these problems. At a nearby farm, the Infinity chip was discovered and it revealed all the technology of the advanced civilization. In 2309, a Declaration of Independence has been sent to Earth. Large armies have been amassed on Mars, and a gigantic armada was waiting for any attack from Earth. The Earth government sends out a fleet of battleships followed by a special air raid unit called ACID; ACID is equipped with a new fighter ship known as the Mosquito.

		<desc>At the end of the Qin's Dynasty, the government weakened by corruption was attacked by foreign influences.

The people were flung into misery and became quite unsatisfied with the situation. They did not believe in the government anymore and turned their faith back to religion.

The White Lotus sect saw this as an opportunity and took over. They claimed to help the government to defeat foreigners and bring peace to the world. Their Ideology was quickly adopted. Everything related with the Western world was killed or destroyed. Anyone against this principal was considered an enemy and accused of being bound with the devil. 

Dragon of Martial Master and Master Huang of Po Chi Lam could not accept these outrageous actions so they band together in order to prevent much bloodshed. One day the leader of White Lotus Sect sent an invitation to Dragon and Master Huang but Dragon's disciples saw this as a trap and recommended that they wait for Master Huang, who was out of town collecting medicine.

The Master did not want to miss this opportunity to make peace and went alone. Unfortunately, he was captured and put in prison. Both parties started confrontations and have struggled since then. Now dangers are hidden all over the place. Who is capable of resolving the situation? Let's find out!</desc>

During each round, the player must defeat each and every one of Mr. Big's henchmen and the deadly enemy machines that patrol the levels. This is achieved either by shooting them with Michael Jackson's 'magical energy', or by using his Dance Magic - the game's equivalent of a smart bomb. Some enemies take only one shot to defeat whereas others take several shots before they are destroyed. The longer the player holds down on the fire button, the greater the amount of magical energy Michael can inflict. At the start of each round, the player is given 2 dance magic smart bombs. Towards the end of each round, Michael's pet chimpanzee, Bubbles, will be seen moving about. If Michael touches Bubbles, he will turn into a powerful robot (the 'Moonwalker' of the game's title). After Michael has become Moonwalker, he will be able to shoot lasers and fire missiles. Michael must defeat every boss enemy at the end of each round in order to proceed to the next.</desc>

		<desc>Ninja Baseball Batman is an abstract, horizontally-scrolling beat-em-up for in which up to four players control a team of robotic baseball-star ninjas who must fight their way through a variety of levels, defeating the game's many enemies. 

The object of the game is to recover a number of artifacts stolen from the Baseball Hall of Fame, a task prescribed to them by the Commissioner of Baseball. Each stage takes place in several parts of the United States, with a boss character appears at the end of each stage.

The game's enemies are themed entirely around the sport of Baseball; taking the form of Baseballs, Catcher's mitts, bats etc. The game also allows players to perform combos, throws and dash attacks against multiple enemies. When a player's health bar flashes red, more moves can be performed as long as the player does not restore or completely lose health. 

Health restoring food and drink items appear throughout the game, as well as throwable weapon pick-ups, including baseballs and shuriken. Occasionally players will find a pink heart, collecting this summons cheerleaders who either damage all on-screen enemies or drop a large amount of food.

The four characters of "Ninja Baseball Batman" and their traits are:

Captain Jose - Head of the team and technician. Well-balanced and a good choice for beginners. 
    
Twinbats Ryno - Very fast and wields two bats, but is the weakest of the four.
    
Beanball Roger - He is a powerful buster, but not as fast as others. 
    
Stick Straw - A long-reach hitter, making him the best choice for long-range moves.</desc>

		<desc>R-Type Leo is a horizontally-scrolling shoot-em-up and is the third and final arcade release of this classic series (although numerous console-only sequels would follow, see 'Series' for details).

Mankind are currently at peace with their former adversaries, the Bydo Empire, and have taken the opportunity to undertake a massive project called 'Project Paradise'. This involved the construction of an artificial terrestrial-like planet called 'Eden', created as a safe haven should humanity once again find itself under threat. However, soon after construction is completed, 'Major' - the bio-computer system responsible for maintaining Eden - malfunctions, taking control of the planet's defences and launching an attack on mankind. It is up to the newly-developed 'R-9 Leo' fleet to fly in and stop Major's assault on its creators.

R-Type Leo deviates from the gameplay style of its predecessors by removing the use of both the 'Force Pod' and the 'Wave Cannon'. The new weapons are called 'Force Bits' (later identified in "R-Type Final" as "Psy Bits") and the 'Bit Shot'. The three 'Force Bit' weapon types are:
Red - Claw Laser: a powerful horizontal laser beam and horizontal traverse wave
Blue - Mirror Laser: fires multiple, ricocheting lasers.
Green - Search Laser LRG: fires semi-homing lasers that can bend at 90 degree angles.

Unlike previous 'Bit' devices, the 'Force/Psy Bits' are capable of firing either forwards or backwards (their direction dictated by the movement of the ship itself). Finally, the 'Wave Cannon' is replaced by a 'Bit Shot', in which the Psy Bits detach from the ship and collide with the nearest enemy. The Bits can only do this for a limited time before running out of energy, and must be recalled to the ship to recharge.

R Type Leo consists of 6 stages and is the first game in the series to allow 2 players to play simultaneously.</desc>

		<name>Rampage: World Tour</name>
		<desc>A sequel to the 1986 original, Rampage World Tour once again has George, Lizzie, and Ralph bent on a trail of destruction. The 'World Tour' of the title refers to the fact that the action now takes place around the entire world, instead of just North America. Graphics are much improved and a kick button has been added to allow even more chaos.

Hidden bonus items have also been added to the game; two examples are an item that allows any player character to transport to almost any location in the game instantly. A second gives the players more destructive power. Some stages have a vat of toxic chemicals that can mutate any player character into a huge purple bat-like creature called V.E.R.N (Violently Enraged Radioactive Nemesis) for the duration of the stage.</desc>

		<desc>Les versions parodiques de Space Invaders sont presque un genre à part entière, un genre dont Space Bomber est une belle incarnation. Après une intro kitschissime qui met tout de suite dans le bain (les méchants aliens arrivent, ouh! pabo!), on attaque une partie d'un jeu complètement à l'ouest. 
Sur les bases donc d'un Space Invaders (pas de scrolling, ennemis qui arrivent d'en haut) le jeu ajoute une plus grande liberté de mouvement, un système de power ups mais surtout un système de capture d'ennemis: le vaisseau dispose d'un grappin lui permettant de kidnapper et de stocker jusqu'à 3 adversaires. On peut ensuite s'en resservir comme arme: chaque type d'ennemi capturé ayant un effet différent, les possibilités sont très nombreuses, avec pas mal de gags débiles à la clé. 
Le jeu joue surtout en effet la carte du comique, avec des ennemis assez ahurissants (cochon géant et poubelle volante ne sont que des aperçus...), et sur un gameplay excellent et très drôle, surtout (comme d'habitude dans ce genre de jeux) à deux joueurs. Les graphismes sont assez spéciaux, dans une 3D pas toujours très réussie mais assez originale.</desc>

		<desc>Spider-man - The Video Game is a sideways scrolling beat-em-up for 1 to 4 players; choosing from Spider-Man, Black-Cat, Hawkeye or Sub-Mariner. The heroes must fight their way through four levels of Dr. Doom's villains; including Venom, The Scorpion, The Lizard, The Green Goblin, The Sandman, The Kingpin, The Hobgoblin, Electro, Dr. Octopus and, of course, Dr. Doom himself.

Each player character has a different weapon or power that can be used throughout the game while fighting. Spider-Man uses his webs, The Black Cat uses her 'cat's claw' grappling hook and cable, Hawkeye uses his bow and arrows and The Sub-Mariner uses his hydro-electric charges. The game's viewpoint pans in and out between alternate large and small scale (4-way scrolling) sections. The game's 'camera' zooms out on alternate levels with the zoomed-out view introducing four-way scrolling platform sections to the gameplay. The game ends when the fourth and final chapter has been completed.</desc>

		<desc>X-Men is a side-scrolling beat-em-up for up to four players. The X-Men's mission is to find and rescue Professor X, who has been captured by evil mutants and is now being held prisoner by Magneto.

Each X-Man character has an 'Attack', 'Jump' and 'Mutant Power' button. The mutant power attack is a powerful special move unique to each X-Man. While it inflicts a lot of damage on the enemies, the trade-off is that each usage removes 3 bars from the players health meter (a full meter has 10 bars). Each level ends with a face-off against a powerful mutant boss character.

The game has six stages, with the final one set on 'Asteroid M', Magneto's base. The defeated mutant bosses from the previous levels each make an appearance (albeit in a less powerful form) before the final encounter with Magneto himself.

Players can chose from 6 X-Men characters, they are:
Cyclops 
Colossus 
Wolverine 
Storm 
Nightcrawler 
Dazzler</desc>

The game's story mirrors that of the film, with former cop Murphy, now a half-human cyborg called 'RoboCop', on a quest to bring down the evil OCP corporation.

RoboCop features nine levels of action, with two of the game's nine stages being into-the-screen target ranges, in which players can try to accrue bonus points and earn extra health. Wooden crates occasionally bar RoboCop's progress, but these can be punched to remove them. Marked crates can be smashed to reveal one of three Weapon power-ups; Three-way Gun, Dual Laser and the incredibly powerful Cobra Gun.

The film's incidental music plays throughout the game and RoboCop's speech is sampled directly from the original film.</desc>

Set in the year 2084, Robotron is a single-screen shoot-em-up in which super-intelligent self-aware robots known as 'Robotrons' - designed and built to help mankind - have revolted against their creators and vowed to either reprogram the humans into Robotrons or, failing this, wipe-out the human race entirely. 

The player must destroy the robots and rescue the Earth's remaining human families. The player's only weapon is a multi-directional Anti-Robot Laser Gun. Used effectively, it will give players the power to destroy all the Robot waves, with the exception of the indestructible 'Hulk' unit. 

At the start of the attack wave, players will have three chances to wipe out the enemy and advance to the next wave. Every 25,000 points players are granted another chance to complete their mission. 

MAN, WOMAN, CHILD: These are the only three types of human clones left on Earth. Defenseless and easy prey to the Robots, they are totally dependent upon players for their survival and will wander aimlessly until the player makes contact with them. Touching them will place them under the player's protective powers and earn them the following points: 1,000 for rescuing the 1st human; 2,000 for the 2nd: 3,000 for the 3rd; 4,000 for the 4th; 5,000 for the 5th; and 5,000 for every additional human saved. At the beginning of each new wave and when the player loses a turn, rescue scoring will again begin at 1,000.
