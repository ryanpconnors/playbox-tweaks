		<path>./3-D Tic-Tac-Toe (USA).zip</path>
		<name>3-D Tic-Tac-Toe</name>
		<desc>The game is similar to the traditional game of tic-tac-toe, but is played on four 4x4 grids stacked vertically; it is basically a computerized version of the board game Qubic using traditional tic-tac-toe notation and layout. To win, a player must place four of their symbols on four squares that line up vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, on a single grid, or spaced evenly over all four grids. This creates a total of 76 possible ways to win, in comparison to eight possible ways to win on a standard 3Ã3 board. The game has nine variations: it can be played by two players against each other, or one player can play against a built-in AI on one of eight different difficulty settings. The game uses the standard joystick controller.</desc>

		<name>A Mysterious Thief</name>
		<desc>In this game, the player plays a thief who must grab all eight valuable objects from the "Mograth Stadtmuseum" within a certain time limit. Once the player reaches the top floor and has collected everything, they escape with a helicopter and the next level starts.

While sneaking around the museum, players have to avoid dogs and guards. The guards appear in the windows from time to time and can be avoided by standing between two windows. A new floor can be reached by running to the end of the current one and jumping through the hole.

After the level is completed, the score is calculated by adding your remaining time and a new and harder round begins.</desc>

		<desc>In 1984, Rob Fulop began work on what would be his last game for the Atari 2600, a 'robot programming' game entitled "Actionauts". Due to the market conditions for Atari 2600 cartridges at the time, Actionauts was never completed, and was not shown or released to the gaming public until 2008.
The original, seemingly simple puzzle-game challenges a single player to use the program editor to construct a sequence of commands to navigate an onscreen robot to reach the 'cheese'. It's not nearly as easy as it looks!</desc>

		<name>Air Raid</name>
		<desc>The object of this game is to defend the buildings at the bottom of the screen.

There are four types of attacking ships moving down the screen. You are moving just above the buildings. The enemies are dropping bombs to try to damage your buildings or destroy you. You must fire missiles up to destroy them. The waves of enemies never ends.

The game ends when all three of your ships are destroyed or when both buildings have taken so much damage that they collapse.

There are eight game variations. Some where the ships move side-to-side while moving down, some where your shots move to the side when you do, some faster and some with combinations of any or all of these.</desc>

		<desc>The player is trapped in a crashed nuclear submarine which has begun taking on water. They need to escape by making their way up the levels of the submarine one at a time. Each floor has two hatch keys that need to be collected in order to unlock the elevator to the next level. There is a time limit, though; if you take too long the floor will flood and you'll be unable to escape. Due to the crash, the torpedoes on board the submarine are now loose and wander across the floor as the boat shakes. The player will need to jump over any torpedoes that cross their path, or they will be stunned momentarily and lose precious time.</desc>

		<path>./Air-Sea Battle (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Air-Sea Battle</name>
		<desc>Air-Sea Battle is basically a target shooting game.  On most settings, you are positioned at the bottom of the screen and you shoot at targets at the top of the screen.  The various settings provide different targets and weapons with different characteristics.

In games 1-6, you are an anti-aircraft gun and you shoot, unsurprisingly, at aircraft.  You are stationary.   Your control is limited to selecting the time of firing, the angle at which your shot is fired and, on some settings, exertion of minor control over the direction of your missile.  

In games 7-12, you are a submarine and you shoot torpedoes at the ships above.  On these settings you are able to move your submarine back and forth across the bottom of the screen.  Your torpedoes, however, can only be fired directly above.  Some settings allow minor control over the direction of your torpedo once fired.
 
In games 13-15, you are apparently the anti-aircraft gun again.  This time, however, you are shooting at shooting gallery targets (clown faces, ducks, rabbits).  The controls are as in games 1-6.  

In games 16-18, you are a ship and you fire polaris missiles at jets flying above.  Your ship constantly moves on its own, you control only the speed.  When you fire, the angle of the missile and its speed are based on the speed your ship was traveling at the time of firing. Some settings restrict your ability to change speed once a missile is fired, others allow you to exert control over the missile by changing speed once the missile is fired.  

In games 19-21, the situation is reversed, you are the jet dropping bombs at the ships below.  The controls in this setting are the same as in games 16-18.  The difference, of course, is that you are dropping bombs from above at targets below.  

In Games 22-27, one player is the jet and the other is the ship.

Each of the two player games is a matter of who can hit more targets in (oddly enough) 2 minutes and 16 seconds.  (The manual says that the game will also end if one player hits 99 targets.  I have yet to see this happen.)  In each of the single player games, the single player tries to outscore a computer opponent that simply constantly fires.</desc>

		<desc>In this game based, loosely, on the movie of the same name, you have to move through a maze (the halls of your ship in the manual), ala Pac-Man, collecting dots (destroying alien eggs). 

If you collect the power dot (pulsar), you can kill any of the three aliens, for a short time. There are only three enemies in the maze at a time, there is a bonus item at times and only one power dot (pulsar) at a time. When you grab the pulsar, it will next appear in one of two other spots.

After you clear one level, you get a bonus game. You have to move up the screen to the prize at the top past several aliens, reminiscent of Freeway. You do not lose a man if you fail but you only have eight seconds to do it then you are off the the next, harder level.</desc>

When deciding on your shot, you will need to take the current conditions into account, which includes wind speed/direction and any mountains that may get in your way. Successfully destroying your opponents gun will earn you a point, and the first player to reach the set number of points wins the game. There are multiple skill levels available which set the amount of time you have to make a shot.</desc>

		<name>AStar</name>
		<desc>AStar is a new puzzle game for the Atari 2600 by Aaron Curtis, whose first homebrew endeavor was the highly popular Fall Down. AStar is inspired by an old calculator game called DStar. The basic idea is to collect all the items (cherries on the first level), but it's not as easy as it may seem at first! You can only move in a straight line until you hit something. You can then change your direction and again move forward until you hit a wall. You also have control of a small block to that you can use to help you navigate the level.

The number of moves you've made is shown at the bottom of the screen. Each level has a minimum number of moves required to complete it, and if you go over this the display will change color. Completing every level in the minimum number of moves (no easy task!) wins the game!

Includes cartridge and full-color manual. Available in NTSC and PAL television formats, please specify above when ordering.</desc>

		<name>Asteroids</name>
		<desc>Asteroids is a conversion of the arcade game of the same name.

Play the role of a spaceship pilot trapped in a gigantic asteroid cloud and pulverize incoming asteroids with the ship's photon cannon.  When all asteroids are destroyed, the play can them move to the next round. In addition to asteroid, the player will also face an Alien Robot Saucer which shoots randomly across the screen.

The player using the controller may rotate the ship (left or right) to any direction or move the ship forward. Shots will be fired according to the ship direction. The player has three reserved ships available to replace a destroyed spaceship. The spaceship is destroyed if an asteroid collides with the spaceship or is shot by an Alien Robot Saucer. Additionally, the player may opt to use the hyperspace warp to avoid collision. The warp however, may also destroy the spaceship in the process.

Asteroids when shot will break-up into smaller pieces or be destroyed.. There are three types of asteroids: large asteroids, medium asteroids, and small asteroids. Large asteroids and medium asteroids when shot, will break-up into two smaller sized asteroids. Small asteroids when shot will be destroyed. 

Alien Robot Saucers come in two sizes: small and large. Both use photon lasers to shoot and will explode when destroyed. Alien Robot Saucers will not appear at the Novice Level.

Game Difficulty and Variations
There are 4 available difficulty settings: Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, and Expert. 

The game also offers three different game variations:

1. Standard Play - For one or two players, taking turns when a player's ship is destroyed.

2. Competition Asteroids - Two players appear on the screen at the same time. Friendly fire is in affect, which means shots fired from one player's spaceship will destroy the other player's spaceship. Each player has separate ship reserves.

3. Team Asteroids - Two players on the screen at the same time. Friendly fire is disabled, which means shots fired from one player's spaceship will not destroy the other player's spaceship and just pass through. Ship reserves for both players are combined.

Scoring
The score of the Player 1 is viewable on the upper left side of the screen, while Player 2 on the opposite upper right side. A player will be awarded a new reserve ship for every 10,000 points.

1. Small saucer - 1,000 points
2. Other player's ship - 500 points
3. Large saucer - 200 points
4. Small asteroid - 100 points
5. Medium asteroid  - 50 points
6. Large asteroid - 20 points</desc>

The object is to get all nine sides to be one color each in the least amount of time or fewest moves, depending on the game variation you select.

Marvin changes a space's color by standing on it and you pressing the fire button. Marvin will then exchange the color he is with the space. Marvin cannot move onto a space of the same color as he is.

To rotate the cube, just move to the edge and press the joystick in the direction to rotate.

The game variations allow for normal or fast speed or timed race or fewest moves.
Other variations cause the cube to show all the spaces as black except when it rotates, so you don't know what color your on.
Two of the game variations, one a timed race and the other a fewest moves challenge, restrict you rotations to up and right only, but do not black out the spaces.

Eight of the game variations have the computer play the game itself.</desc>

		<desc>The year is 2947. Earth is being invaded by the evil Kcaj clan from the Yenrut galaxy. You are Galactic Commander Frank Drexor. The United States Space Guard has commissioned you with the task of defending the most important sector of the galaxy from the invaders. Kcaj technology is much more advanced than the technology of Earth. Some of the ships have tractor beams. Others are equipped with subspace energy disruptors. These disruptors create energy barriers that will actually cause the shots from your cannons to reflect back at you! If your mission is a failure, the Kcaj will gain control of this vital sector of space, allowing them to maneuver their troops and equipment much more efficiently and gain a larger foothold in the battle for the planet. This would certainly spell disaster for the citizens of Earth. Their fate is in your hands! 

You have a gun on the top of the screen and one on the bottom, each of which travel left or right. To switch between weapons, just press the joystick up or down. You must be careful when you fire because if you shoot your own gun, you will lose a life. There is a yellow spaceship that starts on the row next to the middle row and moves across the screen. Each time it reaches the screen, it moves one row closer to one side. If it gets to your gun, you lose as life. Later in the game, barriers appear in the playing field. You must be careful when these are there as they will reflect your gun's shots back, losing you a life if they hit. In the center, at times, there is a UFO colored either red, blue or green. The red is worth one-hundred points, the blue grants and extra life and the green resets the difficulty to level one without removing the points. Play simply continues until you lose all your lives.</desc>

		<desc>This is the game backgammon and its variant, acey deucey. For backgammon, the standard rules are used. As they are long and complex, if you want to see those rules, look in this manual.

Acey Deucey was a variation created by sailors in the U. S. Navy. As such, the rules for acey deucey will vary from ship to ship and person to person. For Atari, this is the variation used here:
All pieces start out on the central Bar and can be entered at any time with the roll of the dice.
No piece NEEDS to be moved from the bar first, even if it was hit and sent to the bar.
A roll of 1-2 (acey deucey) allows a player to choose whichever doublet s/he wants, after making the 1-2 move.
After moving the doublets, the player is awarded another dice roll.
If, after moving your doublet, the other dice roll is 1-2, you can move the 1-2 and choose another doublet.

Difficulty switches
Right:
A=computer rolls dice for you
B=you can roll real dice and dial in the numbers
Left:
A=computer sets up the board for you
B=you can set the pieces where you want them.

Game variations
Games 1, 3, 5, and 7 are one player
Games 2, 4, 6, and 8 are two player

Games one through four are backgammon
Games five through eight are acey deucey

Games 1, 2, 5, and 6 have a doubling cube.</desc>

		<name>Bank Heist</name>
		<desc>You are a bank robber, driving around a maze of streets (representing the city) in a 1930's style car.  Your purpose is clear: perform "bank heists" by driving across white-pillared symbols that represent banks.  As you "rob" each of the banks, they disappear, and a police car appears in its place, beginning hot pursuit after a few moments.  You must avoid the cops to stay alive.  Fortunately you are not completely defenseless, as you have a stock of dynamite, which you can strategically drop to destroy the cop cars.

Besides the escape tunnel that will take you from one side of the screen to another (as in Pac-Man), there is an additional tunnel that represents the road out of town.  By taking it, you will find yourself in the next city.  Each city is increasingly difficult, and the cop cars are faster and smarter.

There are 9 banks in each town, and you receive an increase in gasoline each time you rob one.  Therefore, the goal of the game is to drive from town to town, navigating the mazes of streets, and robbing as many of the banks in each town as you are able to.  This keeps your gas supply high, and the money rolling in!  If you run out of gas, the game is over.</desc>

		<desc>A very simple math game for kids.

Each game of Basic Math gives the player a set of ten basic math problems (i.e. simple addition, subtraction, multiplication or division) to solve. The player is presented with two numbers and a function, and inputs the answer by cycling through numbers with the joystick. A timer option is available to ramp up the difficulty.  The game has eight primary game settings - basically two settings for each mathematical function.  Games 1 - 4 allow you to select one of the numbers you will be working with, while 5 - 8 give random questions.   

Hint: For division problems that have a remainder make sure to put a space between the whole number and the remainder, which goes to the right.</desc>

Controls simulate the tracks of a tank realistically, so the direction and speed settings are varied - combining forward right and backward left movements (as you can on keyboard versions) sees you change direction more quickly.</desc>

		<name>Beamrider</name>
		<desc>Beamrider is a 3-D arcade action game. You control a beam riding spaceship on a mission to clear 99 sectors of space from hostile aliens. The spaceship is located at the bottom of the screen and it can only stop on one of five beams. You are armed with both lasers and torpedoes; torpedoes are more powerful and can destroy more enemies compared to lasers, however you only get three per level. To complete a sector, you need to destroy fifteen white flying saucers. After all saucers are destroyed, the sector sentinel passes by which can be destroyed for extra points. Each even number sector up until sector 16 will add a new type of enemy to deal with. These additional enemies will just try to slow your mission, though, only the saucers need to be destroyed to advance. Occassionally a rejeuvinator will appear; if this is collected, you can earn an extra life. But be careful, because if you accidentally shoot the rejeuvinator it will turn into an enemy!</desc>

The object is to stun then capture Beannies. You can also capture Bouncing Orange Eyeballs and various Falling Objects.

If an unstunned Beanny touches you, you lose a life. You don't need to stun the other items to capture them but doing so makes them slow down.

You get a bonus Bopper by shooting four Beannies in a row without losing a Bopper.

There are two game options, one where the Beannies bounce off the walls on screen, the other where they pass through.</desc>

The game play is the same. Eliminate robots on the screen. Do not touch them or the walls or you die. Do not let them shoot you. Do not linger in a maze or Evil Otto will come after you and he cannot be stopped so you would have to run.</desc>

		<desc>Big Bird wants to win the county fair egg contest and you can help him.

A chicken at the top will lay and egg and it will go down a chute. You must get Big Bird under the correct chute to catch the egg.

Game one is one player only. Games two through ten are one or two player. All games have two rounds.

Game one is a practice round. There are two chickens, straight chutes and when you move Big Bird left or right, he pops right under the chute.

Games two and three have three then four chutes and the game gets faster in the second round. Game two's chutes are straight, game three's zig-zag. Big Bird still pops under a chute.

Games four, five and six have three rounds. There will be eleven white eggs dropped and one golden egg. Games four starts with two zig-zagging chutes in the first round and four in the second. Game five has two crisscrossing chutes in the first round, four in the second. Game six has four crisscrossing chutes in both rounds. Big Bird  no longer pops under the chute but must be positioned correctly.

Games seven has eleven white eggs and one golden egg dropping per round with unlimited rounds. There are five broken eggs on the bottom left and you do rounds until you miss so many eggs you are out of broken eggs. when you catch the golden egg, in addition to points, you get an extra broken egg.

Game eight is the same as game seven except you can't see an egg in the chute, only when it pops out the bottom.

Games nine and ten are the same as game seven but the chutes shrink up in the direction of the hens. This means you must memorize when the chute comes out for which chicken. In game nine, the chutes are all the same for each round. In game ten, the patterns change per round.

Each white egg caught is worth one point, each golden egg, five.

For ages three to seven.</desc>

		<name>Bionic Breakthrough</name>
		<desc>The Atari Mindlink was an unreleased controller for the Atari 2600. It was intended for release in 1984. The Mindlink was unique in that you had to move the muscles in your head to control the game. These movements would be read by infrared sensors and transferred as movement in the game. Games would be similar to ones that used the paddle controller, but with the Mindlink instead. Testing showed that players frequently got headaches moving their eyebrows around to play the game. Though Atari could have tried to refine the device over time, Atari simply decided to shelve the Mindlink. Two games were in development for the Mindlink by its cancellation, Bionic Breakthrough &amp; Mind Maze.

Bionic Breakthrough was basically Breakout controlled with the Mindlink, while Mind Maze was an attempt to use ESP through the Mindlink to predict what is printed on cards, which admittedly didn't work. Neither game would see release in a joystick or paddle controlled form in later years, partly due to the failing video game industry, partly due to the games' limited appeal.</desc>

A player breaks the bank when he reaches 1000 chips and loses when he has no more chips to bet. In both cases, he is removed from the game. At any time, a player may quit or resume the game by using the game select switch. A player who went broke or who reached 1000 chips may also stay on the game using the same switch.

The blue print for the machine is at the bottom of the screen, so all you need to do is locate the parts which are hidden in the numerous houses in a maze like town. When you locate a part, drag it back and place it on the blue print. When all parts have been located, press the start button and the machine is ready to go! To make your task more difficult, there are several obstacles that get in the way. If you enter a house which doesn't contain a part, you will instead be stuck with a bomb. You will need to hurry and diffuse any bombs in the bomb pit before they explode! From time to time, a flower pot will fall from above and then hop off the screen. Get hit by a flower pot, and you lose a life. You also need to be careful of Fuzzy Wuzzy, who wanders around the neighborhood randomly. An encounter with Fuzzy Wuzzy will also be deadly! Hiding in the bomb pit is Sneaky Pete; while he isn't deadly, he will occasionally appear and press the start button before your machine is complete. If this happens, you will need to drag Pete back to the bomb pit and reassemble all of the machine parts.</desc>

If you succeed in knocking down all the pins on your first roll, it's called a "strike".  A strike is marked with an "x" on the TV screen.

If you leave pins standing, but "pick them up" on your second try, it's called a "spare".  Spares are marked with a "/" on the screen.

An "open frame" occurs when you fail to knock down all then pins in two rolls.  Open frames are indicated with a straight horizontal line (-) on the screen.

Count Me: The computer will display a sequence of numbers. Using the controller, you need to press the numbered buttons in the same order the computer displayed them.

Picture Me: The computer will display a series of symbols. It will then scramble the order they are displayed in, and you need to reorder the symbols back into their original configuration.

Find Me: The computer will display a series of objects on the screen, and you need to select the object which is dissimilar from the others. Your score is based on how fast you can successfully do this.

Add Me: The computer will display a list of numbers. You need to enter in the sum of the numbers before the timer runs out.

Play Me: This game allows you to play your own songs in free form mode; each button on the controller represents a musical note. Both controllers can be used for a duet, and several example songs are included in the instruction manual.</desc>

You have three levels on the screen. You must select a level then press your button to steal the carrot. Once the carrot is stolen, Elmer's hound will dig where the carrot was, forcing you to come above ground. You must then make your way to the hole the hound dug and dive in to safety before Elmer blasts you. Once you have cleared all three levels, it is on to the next screen. If Elmer shoots you three times, the game is over. In a two player game, one player is Bugs, the other is Elmer.</desc>

As you race through the treacherous and ever changing roadways, the numerous enemy cars will be trying to bump you off the road. You need to make sure you bump the cars out of the way before you get bumped and crash into the sides yourself! Your car also has the ability to jump quite high if you have enough speed. This is useful to jump over enemy cars if there are too many in the way, and must also be used to jump gaps in the roadway and other highway obstacles. As the levels progress, the road becomes narrower with more obstacles in the way, and the other cars increase in number and in aggressiveness.</desc>

		<desc>You play as Chef Pepper and your goal is to make giant hamburgers while evil eggs, sausages and pickles chase you around the game area. 

To properly make a hamburger you must assemble all of the ingredients together, dropping them from higher up onto the the burger area below. To actually do this you have to let Chef Pepper step all over the burger ingredients. As soon as an ingredient (a piece of lettuce for instance) has been stepped on, it will fall to the next level below. Falling food will squish any enemy following you and will also"bump" any other ingredient bellow it farther down. Also, as an emergency defense against the enemy food, you can collect pepper shakers which will allow you to puff out a small pepper cloud which will momentarily stun enemies, allowing you to walk past them.

Higher levels result in new level design, faster enemies and more ingredients to assemble.

The PlayStation 2 version is a port of the original arcade game and comes with a soundtrack disc, a DVD, a guide book and some other bonuses.</desc>

		<name>Cabbage Patch Kids : Adventures in the Park</name>
		<desc>Another long-lost unreleased prototype has now seen the light of day, thanks to a discovery by Alex Handy at a flea market in California. Alex located a cache of old EPROMs, later realizing he had come across a copy of Cabbage Patch Kids: Adventures in the Park for the Atari 2600, a title released for the ColecoVision but which never saw the light of day on the 2600. With the help of long-time Atari enthusiast Joe Grand, all of Alex's finds were dumped. The bulk of the dumps were ColecoVision related, but the Cabbage Patch game for the 2600 turned out to be the find of a lifetime for Atari fans. Alex quickly posted all of the dumped binaries on his blog, including 10 different versions of the Cabbage Patch game.

As luck would have it, Cabbage Patch Kids: Adventures in the Park is an impressive game, comparable in quality to many modern homebrew games. Cabbage Patch Kids is a side-scrolling game, similar to Pitfall! in this regard. The game consists of various screens that have different obstacles that must be overcome in order to proceed to the next screen. These include water-filled pits, bouncing balls, floating platforms, bees, and fires. You must complete ten screens on each level before a timer runs out. While traversing the screens you can also use trampolines to collect objects hidden in the trees for additional points.

Our thanks go out to Alex Handy for graciously sharing all of his impressive flea market haul with the classic gaming community.</desc>

If you are hit by the utensils or miss a pastry, the janitor has to clean it up. If he has to clean up too many times, he gets upset and storms out and game over.

You can push the button to stop a conveyor belt for about four seconds but if you stop a second one, the first belt starts right back up. On games with belt speed up, you can push right on the joystick to speed up the belt you are in front of.

At the end of each level, you will have a cup of coffee come down the belt, but not fall off the end. When you grab the cup, you get and extra clean-up (life) and the next level begins.

Difficulty switches
Set the left switch to A to start at level five. Set to B to start at level one. The right switch is not used.

The are game variations that force the baker to pause when transferring boxes, making it harder, variations that allow belt speedup, variations with fast moving bakers and variations with all gingerbread men.</desc>

This game is extremely limited in that it is played using only the paddle controller's fire button. You do not control the movement of the planes and helicopters, but rather you must time your shots to do the most damage.

The cartridge includes a secondary variation titled "Sea Bomber" that is a little more interactive. In this game, you deploy bombs onto seafaring ships, but this time you can use the paddle controller's knob to determine the depth of the bombs.</desc>

		<path>./Centipede (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Centipede</name>
		<desc>In Centipede, the player is trapped in the Enchanted Forest. Armed with only a magic wand to ward off the forest's insect denizens, all of which apparently are attacking in the player in continuous waves. 

The player must use the magic wand to shoot sparks at approaching insects to score points by pressing the controller button. Holding down the controller button will set the wand to rapid fire shots. If the player is bitten by an insect, the player will be temporarily paralyzed and lose one of the three starting magic wands. 

Insect Opponents and Mushrooms
All enemy insects have a distinctive sound before attacking, which may help the player identify which insect is attacking. Enemies and objects in the game are as the following:

1. The Centipede
The Centipede will attack in 12 waves. In the first wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 11 body segments. In the second wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 10 body segments, in addition to a detached head. The third wave will have the Centipede with an attached head, 9 body segments, plus two detached heads. These body segments will transform into heads and continue to do so until Wave 12. In the last wave, the Centipede will have 12 detached heads, independently attacking the player. Centipede heads are worth more points than body segments.

Attacks from the Centipede will come from the top of the screen, moving downward. If a spark hits any part of the Centipede, that particular body segment will transform into a mushroom, while the body segment behind it will become the new Centipede head. When the Centipede is destroyed, it will briefly disappear and re-appear from the top of the screen again.

The Spider
The Spider will attempt to distract the player from attacking the Centipede. It will destroy any mushroom it touches. Spiders will score more points if it is hit in closer distances.

The Flea
The Flea will appear if the player has destroyed most of the existing mushrooms. It will drop down creating a new batch of mushrooms where it falls. The Flea will disappear after two hits. After the first hit, the Flea will drop down much faster.

The Scorpion
The Scorpion will appear in the third wave. It moves slowly but will pick up speed, moving faster. While doing so, it will poison any mushroom it touches.

Mushrooms
Mushrooms fill the Enchanted Forest and may act as obstacles or cover for the player, with added effects to enemy insects. It takes for shots to complete destroy a mushroom. There are two type of mushrooms: Magic Mushrooms and Poisonous mushrooms. Magic mushrooms are the default mushrooms in the game and are also the the result of the player destroying an insect or Centipede body segment. Poisonous Mushrooms are the result of the Scorpion touching a mushroom. Poisonous Mushrooms will prompt the Centipede near it to move straight towards the player through any mushroom. Losing a wand will restore any partially damaged mushroom.

Game Difficulty and Variations
The game offers four difficulty levels: Novice, Standard, Advanced, and Expert. Game Variations are as the following:

1. One Player
Two Player Alternating
Two players will take turns when the active player is bitten.
Dual Player Competition
Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is separate. Shots fired from one player will paralyze the other player.
Team Play
Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is combined. Shots fired from one player will not paralyze the other player.

Scoring
The player will win a bonus magic wand for every 12,000 points to a maximum of six wands. The game will end when all wands are lost. Scoring are as the following:

Centipede Head - 100 points
Centipede Body Segment - 10 points
Spider at close range - 900 points
Spider at medium range - 600 points
Flea - 200 points

		<desc>PelÃ©'s Soccer is an Atari 2600 game based on the famous football (soccer) player PelÃ©, and published in 1981.

It features basic graphics, ball handing and goal keeping techniques using the Atari joystick. Each team has one forward, two defensemen, and a goaltender on the field at all times. The player's goaltender is always controlled by the computer unless he saves a shot. Each game consists of two halves of various time lengths (depending on the game settings being used). All the forwards and backs run in their proper formation.
There are 54 different game variations (27 single-player and 27 multiplayer) that allow for different speeds, game lengths, and goal sizes.</desc>

		<name>Chase the Chuckwagon</name>
		<desc>Released as part of a promotional campaign for Purina Dog Chow, Chase the Chuck Wagon puts players in control of Chuckie the Dog. Chuckie must be guided through a maze, avoiding objects and the dogcatcher, to the top of the screen where he can go directly beneath the chuck wagon to catch it.

Escaping from the maze allows Chuckie to enter a Reward Screen.  Here, Chuckie can find a bowl of dog food in the maze to eat for extra bonus points.  If Chuckie misses, no points will be awarded, and he will simply be sent to the next screen.

Chase the Chuck Wagon was available only as an exclusive through Ralston-Purina.</desc>

		<name>Checkers</name>
		<desc>Checkers is a computerized version of the popular board game and follows the same rules; the object of the game is to remove all of your opponents pieces from the 8x8 game board. This is accomplished by moving your pieces diagonally forward on the board; an opponents piece is removed from play if one of your pieces jumps over it (if any of your pieces are able to jump an opponents piece, you must make that move). When beginning the game pieces can only move in a diagonal forward direction until they reach the other side of the board; that piece then becomes "kinged" allowing movement both forwards and backwards. The game can be played by one player against the computer (with three skill levels available) or two players against each other.</desc>

		<desc>The Spectra Island reactor provides power for millions of residents. Ordinarily, there is no problem but there has been an earthquake. This has damaged the reactor, causing it to release radioactive particles. You must use the robot arm to retrieve these particles before the radiation builds too much and we have a meltdown.

There are three sections per screen. They are colored, from top to bottom, red, blue and yellow. You start with one particle in each area and you must move the robot arm to intercept these particles, pushing the fire button to grasp them when they get to the robot arm.

If you delay to long, however, the particles will split as they bounce around, causing the radiation level to build. If the radiation builds too much, you lose one robot arm. In later levels, you also must avoid hitting the circulating fans, as this will also destroy the robot arm. The game ends when you clear level nine and save the day or lose your last robot arm and the reactor enters meltdown.</desc>

		<desc>In this action game you play the part of Chuck Norris on a quest to reach a monastery where an important leader is kept hostage. The game consists of several different screens: when beginning and between fights you will see a view of the path that leads to the monastery. Walking along the path, you will encounter numerous enemies. When fighting, the view switches to a close up of your current location. By pressing the joystick button and moving the joystick in one of four directions you can perform various kicks, punches, and blocks. The enemies you encounter are varied, and some can only be defeated by certain moves. The path you walk along will occasionally split up into two or more choices; when this happens, only one choice is correct and the others are dead ends. If you choose incorrectly, you'll have to back track a bit and try again. Beginning as a white belt, you will slowly increase in rank as you win fights. By the time you reach the monastery you need to earn black belt status in order to defeat the deadly ninjas inside! Your quest must be completed within a time limit, or the game is over. Walking off of the path or losing fights will also cause you to lose even more time.</desc>

		<desc>In Codebreaker your goal is to guess a 3 or 4 digit secret code which is generated by either the computer or another player. Depending on the difficulty setting, the player has either 8 or 12 guesses to figure out the code by entering in values with the keyboard controller. After each guess, the computer analyzes your input and displays results which indicate if you have a correct digit in the correct position, a correct digit in the wrong position, or no correct digits at all. Points are scored based on how many turns it takes to correctly identify the code. A second game variation called Nim is also included. In this game, two players take turns removing items from a stack. On each turn, a player must take at least one item from a stack, and the player who removes the last item from the screen wins. You can have the computer set up the stacks automatically or set them up manually, and a variation is included where the player who removes the last item from the screen loses rather than wins.

		<desc>Mayday! Mayday! This is Colony 7! We are under attack by the Jarvians! Defensive shield has been raised. We will do what we can to survive.

This is an Atari 2600 port of a 1981 Taito arcade game. The Jarvian have attacked. You must defend Colony 7. You are manning the defensive guns that defend the colony. The Jarvians will send wave after wave to try to break through the colony's defense shield and/or destroy the defense cannons. The defense laser fires non-stop so you just need to use the joystick to place the cross hair over an enemy to kill them. If the enemies get to be too much, press fire to activate the Mega Blaster and destroy all the enemies on the screen.. Be advised that you only have three shots for the Mega Blaster. If the colony or cannons are destroyed, the game is over.

The Jarvian ships are:

1. The Fighter: This is the most common and several attack at once, firing at the shield and colony and, sometimes, your cannon.

2. The Advisor: This will cause the Fighters to target faster so remove it as soon as you can.

3. The Bomber: This one will not target the shield but will try to bomb your cannon. Shoot it and/or it's bombs before they reach their target.

4. The Scout: This one will call in replacement ships so see to it that he doesn't stay long.</desc>

		<desc>The year is 2037. Nations no longer fight monster wars, killing millions. Instead, two combatants enter an arena and fight for their countries honor.

This is a sequel to the 1977 game Combat however, there are no planes, just tanks and missiles. Each player starts in a base in a corner, one in the upper left, the other in the lower right. You must seek out your opponent and shoot them three times to destroy their tank. If they are under trees or, in another game variation, behind walls, you must shoot the trees/walls out of the way first to reach them. Each player has three tanks. The winner is the last one standing.

If you are still in your base, you can press the button to fire a homing missile that will seek out you opponent. When the homing missile hits, it counts as two shots. Missiles must reload between shots and the reloading time is several seconds. If a tank is not hit for several seconds, the 'crew' will affect repairs.

There are game variations for trees, which you can drive but not shoot through, walls, which you can neither drive nor shoot through   and versions where you can place the trees/walls where you would like them to be.</desc>

		<path>./Confrontation (USA) (Proto).zip</path>
		<name>Confrontation</name>
		<desc>Confrontation is a strange strategy game which was never commercially released, but was available directly from Answer for a short time.  Only people who saw it on display at the 1983 CES show would have know about it and ordered it so while it's not technically a prototype, it's close enough.  I've racked my brain on how to best describe the gameplay of this game, and after much searching I've determined the best description is in Leonard Herman's "ABC's to the VCS" (pick up a copy today!).  Since Confrontation uses a programming trick to display so many objects on the screen at once, screenshots will only show one players pieces at a time.  Take my word for it, they're really all there.

Confrontation is a very unique game which can only be played by two opposing players.  In this unusual chess-like game, each player controls four pawns and a captain.  The blue player's pawns are lined up vertically along the left border of the playfield while the red player's pawns are along the right. Blue's Captain is at the top center of the playfield and red's is at the bottom.  The object of the game is to move your four pawns to the opposite side of the board where they will be removed.  Once all of your pawns are gone, you must get your captain over to your opponent's side of the board and remove it also.  The first player to remove all of his pieces wins the game. 

Confrontation is a highly original strategy game in an era when fast paced action and shooting games were all rage.  If more innovative games like this had been released the crash of 83-84 may not have happened.  But as we all know the video game industry was done in by bad clone after bad clone, and Answer Software was not immune to its effects.  Games like Confrontation were left in dust, never even reaching store shelves.</desc>

		<desc>In the year 4014, the planet Earth and the planet Mars are locked in a century-long war. The Martians have devised a plan to destroy Earth using the power from their latest weapon: the Destructo-Bomb!! The Martian forces have managed to construct five bombs and have placed them deep inside the Martian Caverns, awaiting the final command from their leader to attack!!! Do you have the skill to navigate to the depths of the Martian caverns, active the Destructo-Bombs, and escape before they explode? Good Luck!

Conquest of Mars is an accurate translation to the Atari 2600 of a popular Atari 8-bit computer title. Destroy the Martian rebellion by descending through the six caverns of Mars to activate the main energy reactors and escape to the surface before they blow up! Do you have the skill and quick reflexes required to descend into the Martian depths without being annihilated? And once you reach the bottom, can you make it out alive?

Conquest of Mars may be purchased in cartridge form from the AtariAge Store.</desc>

		<name>Cookie Monster Munch</name>
		<desc>Cookie Monster hungry! Want cookie!

You are moving around a maze, collecting cookies and bringing them back to a cookie jar.

Games one through three are one player, games four through ten are one or two player.

In games one, two and three, you move Cookie Monster around the maze, get the cookies and return them to the cookie jar, one at a time. Between mazes, Cookie Monster eats each cookie, one at a time. There are three mazes per game. In game one, there are one, two then three cookies. In game two, four, five then six and in game three, seven, eight the nine.

Games four through six are timed. You can carry multiple cookies and keep playing mazes until time runs out. In games four, five and six, you have five, four and three minutes, respectively.

Games seven through nine are also timed but now you play as the Cookie Kid. You are trying to collect cookies for a surprise party for Cookie Monster. Since he hasn't been told this, he is pacing back and forth on the other side on the fence. Each time you pick up a cookie, Cookie Monster jumps over the fence and chases you. He will each and cookies of the path he is coming down and if he catches you, he will eat all the cookies you are carrying. The times for games seven, eight and nine are five, four and three minutes, respectively.

Game ten in the same as game nine (three minute time limit, you are Cookie Kid and chased by Cookie Monster) except the maze is invisible. When you pick up a cookie, the maze flashes for a second so you can figure out the fastest route to take.

You get one point per cookie in the jar.

For ages three to seven.</desc>

		<name>Cosmic Ark</name>
		<desc>The Alpha Ro solar system is in crisis! Their sun is about to go supernova, meaning the death of all the many planets and the exotic lifeforms who call them home. Luckily, though, the noble Atlanteans have heard of Alpha Ro's plight and have sent a vast Cosmic Ark thousands of light-years across the galaxy to try and save as many species as possible. As the captain of the Ark, the player will have to contend with deadly meteor storms and planetary defense systems to succeed the mission.

Cosmic Ark features two play screens: On the first, the player will have to blast meteors with four-way cannons. Blast enough and the player can go on to the second screen. The Ark descends low over one of Alpha Ro's planets. The player will then have to guide a shuttle craft down and beam aboard two creatures, while avoiding any laser defense system that may be in operation. The player will have to get the creatures back on board quickly, because another meteor shower could happen at any moment. Then it's off to the next planet!</desc>

		<name>Cosmic Commuter</name>
		<desc>Cosmic Commuter takes place in the year 2075. You work for the Galactic Travel Agency, and need to help the citizens commute to and from work! Each level consists of several parts. First, you must successfully land the rocket module on the planet surface (this contains your astrobus). This part of the game is similar to the game Lunar Lander; you must control the speed of the lander to make sure you don't crash! In the second, horizontally scrolling segment you control the astrobus and attempt to pick up the commuters at the bus stops. Once all of the commuters are picked up, return to the rocket module and take off to transport the commuters to the grand central space station. Of course, there are many obstacles which can prevent a successful mission. Meteors, fireballs and space mines all get in the way and can destroy your astrobus. Your astrobus is equipped with a laser that can be used to destroy these obstacles. The astrobus also has a limited amount of fuel; if you start running out you better find more fuel before you crash!</desc>

		<name>Cosmic Swarm</name>
		<desc>You are at the Waypoint Interstellar Trade Depot, a quiet outpost in space, when suddenly a dormant group of alien, mineral-eating termites awakens. They then begin haphazardly making their nest.

Using your probe ship, you must destroy the termites and their nest blocks. You simply fire at the termites to destroy them but their nest blocks must be energized before you can destroy them. To energize a nest block, you must hit a block while a termite is still carrying it. This will energize all the blocks on the screen.

If you shoot a termite that is not carrying a block or if one is carrying a block but you only hit the termite, all the blocks will not be energized and not be damageable. If you run into a block, energized or not, or are touched by a termite, you lose a life.

Every so often, a refuel ship travels down and then back up the left or right side of the screen. You must dock with it (touch it) before it gets back to the top or the game ends, no matter how many lives you have left.

To fire, press the fire button. To move, move the joystick while the button is not pressed. If you hold down the button, you can rotate left or right then you will stay at that angle until you rotate again.

The points are:
Shooting a termite that is NOT carrying a block=1 point
Shooting a termite that is carrying a block but only hitting the termite=2 points
Shooting a termite that is carrying a block and hitting the block=3 points
Shooting an energized block=1 point</desc>

		<desc>As a professional ornithologist, you're thrilled to find out that some rare South American hornbills have nested in your "old yolk tree." But while the hornbills are out feeding, a group of mischievous bluebirds, owls, and snakes begin raiding their nests and stealing eggs.

You get out your slingshot and begin hitting the marauding creatures. But you have to be careful. If you hit an egg-carrying bird, it drops the egg and you have to act fast to catch it before it hits the ground and return it to a nest. At the same time, you have to watch for snakes that may be sneaking up to nests and gobbling eggs. If you can protect the eggs long enough, you can take them to another nesting site.</desc>

These can be dropped on the bugs to destroy them as they make their way up from the sewer at the bottom. Just beneath the potted plants are six windows; you need to make sure you destroy the bugs before they can reach these windows. If six of the bugs make it into the windows, a layer of your house will be eaten. This will drop you one step closer to the bottom of the screen, making it more difficult to destroy the incoming bugs! The game ends when six layers of the building have been eaten.

Your enemies and their point values are:
Plane = 300
Helicopter = 100
Bird = 0
Boat = 50
Sting Ray = 20
Shark = 100
Angler Fish = 200

Lobster = 25

You get 1 point for stunning the sea monster but cannot kill him. You cannot do anything with mines but avoid them.

The possible treasures and their point values are:
Sword = 200
Wine Bottle = 400
Sunken Boat = 500
Crown = 1000
Chalice = 2000
Pot of Gold = 3000

		<name>Crazy Climber</name>
		<desc>As Crazy Climber, climb your way to the top of a series of buildings, where a helicopter is waiting to pick you up and take you to the next building. As Climber scales a building, he is able to climb up and sideways but he cannot climb down.
While climbing a building, windows will open and close simultaneously. If any window closes on either of his hands he will lose his grip. However, if a window closes on both of his hands, he will fall to his death, resulting in the loss of a life. You have three Climbers in total, but you are awarded an extra Climber every 30,000 points. Besides windows, Climber is faced with other dangers, including:

1. Bald-headed guys who hurl various objects at you.
2. Pesky condors who fly by, dropping eggs and droppings of an unpleasant substance.
3. Falling steel girders and iron dumbells.
4. Electrical "Nichibutsu" signs with a dangling live wire.
5. Falling "Crazy Climber" signs.
6. King Kong leaping from side to side of the building and slams his hands against the windows.

The climber must try to avoid or overcome each of those hazards which he will encounter as he continues climbing in his attempt to reach the rooftop. If he falls to his death by windows or objects,  another climber will replace him and will start at the same location where the last one fell. The specific danger will not be present at the same point, so the climber can go further up to face the next danger. Most of the hazards are announced by certain recognizable musical themes. 

Crazy Climber is awarded a bonus score on each building every time after getting carried off by the helicopter. However, each bonus score will decrease by every ten seconds that the climber will spend scaling each building as he attempts reach the top. Somewhere in the game, there is "The Lucky Balloon", which can lift Climber about ten stories and raise the player's bonus score if he catches it.</desc>

You have two lasers, one at the top that fires down and one at the bottom that fires up. You control both lasers.

Be aware, however, that if you fire you weapon non-stop, it will overheat and then will not fire until it cools a little. Also be aware of the amount of fuel you have because if you run out of fuel, you lose one life. You need to shoot any red fuel pods when they appear on screen.</desc>

		<name>Dark Chambers</name>
		<desc>Dark Chambers is an arcade action game similar to Gauntlet. You are an explorer in an underground maze; your goal is to survive the 26 different levels and collect as many of the hidden treasures as you can. Hidden somewhere in each of the levels is an exit which will take you on to the next level. Trying to stop you from completing your quest are a wide variety of creatures, including zombies, wraiths, skeletons, wizards, and the grim reaper. Each of the creatures in the game has a different strength; when you shoot a creature, it will transform into the next weaker creature. Eventually a creature will become the weakest one (a zombie) at which point it can be destroyed. In addition to the creatures and treasures, other items that can be found in the maze are keys (to open doors), potions (to restore health), poison (drains health), guns (increases your firing rate), traps, shields, and bombs. The game is played from an overhead point of view, and is for one player or two players simultaneously.</desc>

		<desc>You are Deadly Duck and the object is to shoot your bill bullets at crabs, the bricks they drop and dragonflies.

Each level starts with eight crabs. The crabs grab bricks from the sides and try to drop them on you. You can shoot the bricks as they fall and the crabs but if a brick lands on you, you're a dead duck.
When a brick lands, it will stay on the pond for a moment, blocking you from moving horizontally.

On levels two to four, you have two, four and six dragonflies, respectively, moving together just under the crabs. You get ten points for shooting the dragonflies but this makes them angry. They then drop one, two or three bombs (depending on the level). If you are next to a bomb when it explodes, your goose is cooked.

The game continues until you lose all you ducks.

It's all enough to make you quack up.</desc>

		<path>./Death Trap (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Death Trap</name>
		<desc>You have been sent to deliver a message. Suddenly, you run into the giant ship IT. IT doesn't want that message to get to the Galactic Emperor. You must destroy all three power generators to escape. One generator is hidden until the other two are destroyed.

IT is protected by three shields above you; which are A, B, and C, from top to bottom. There is a forth shield, D, below you. Touching any shield is instant game over. IT also has guided fireballs that chase your ship for a short distance. Getting hit by these too many times will kill you. If you can avoid getting hit long enough, your repair crew might can undo some of the damage (see Game variations below)

You use the joystick to move the ship, left, right, up or down. Press the fire button to launch a torpedo. If you keep the fire button down, you can guide the torpedo left or right or accelerate it. Be advised, though, that you ship isn't moving while you are guiding the torpedo and could get damaged or destroyed.

As you damage IT's generators, shields A, B, and C will get invulnerable sections. These move across the shields, making it harder to get shots through the longer you play. If you do not hit the left or right generators for 15 seconds, IT will lower shield C, reducing your maneuvering room. You will also lose points (see Scoring below).

After you destroy the left and right generators, the center generator will be visible. When you destroy that, you win the game. However, as you hit the center generator, shield D will raise so you must work fast as possible.

You start with six ships at the bottom of the screen. Each time a fireball hits you, you lose a ship. Lose them all and the game is over.

Game variations
After you press the fire button to select your joystick, you then choose your difficulty by moving the joystick up or down.

The difficulty settings are:
Easy (the square)=Fireball firing rate is slow, invulnerable shield segments are small, you have a repair crew.
Normal (the X)=Fireball firing rate is normal, invulnerable shield segments are normal, you have a repair crew.
Hard (the diamond)=Fireball firing rate is fast, invulnerable shield segments are normal, you do not have a repair crew. That means any lost ships from fireball strikes are never regained.

The difficulty switches are not used.
After you have the setting you want, move the joystick to the right to begin the game.

Scoring
Readiness=Every few seconds, you get 1 point for each ship at the bottom of the screen, up to a maximum of 6.
Damage=The number of hits to a generator multiplied by ten. For instance, the first hit is 10 points, the 7th hit is 70 points, the 12th hit is 120 points, etc.
Destroy the left or right generator=2000 points
Destroy the center generator=5000 points
Shield C lowers=lose 90 points, although your score will never be lower than zero.</desc>

You are Demolition Herby and you're out to own the roads. You must drive around a square section to black it out; the object being to black out all sections. There are only three things in your way: the chase cars. When they drive over a line you have turned red, it turns white again. To make matters worse, they will try to ram you off the track. The good news is if you ram them from behind, you run them off the track for a few seconds. If you need a burst of speed, shift into overdrive by pressing your button however, there is a drawback, as I will explain. Something else to keep an eye on is your fuel. You burn fuel as your drive and burn faster when you use overdrive. Each time you black out an section, you gain points and fuel. If you black out two sections at once, you gain more fuel. You will lose a life if you run out of fuel or are knocked off the track. If you lose three lives, the game is over.</desc>

The game features a scrolling, isometric point of view as you control your falcon through the various desert landscapes. The treasures you are after are guarded of course. Many desert creatures including vultures, warriors, flying fish, sphinxes and more will all attempt to stop you from succeeding in your task. Also, at the end of each level you will need to face a large, howling sphinx before you can continue on. Your falcon isn't completely unarmed, and has the ability to fire darts which can be used to destroy the assorted enemies and the sphinx. In the sand, you will occasionally come across some hieroglyphs. Several different superpowers can be gained by landing and hopping over three of these hieroglyphs. Depending on which hieroglyphs are collected, you may become invincible, warp to the end of the level, earn free points, trick enemies into attacking a decoy instead of you, or even get an air bomb which destroys all airborne enemies.</desc>

As you swim away from the squid, you will encounter schools of sea horses which form a vertical row on the screen with only a small opening to swim through. As you approach each school, the dolphins sonar will help you locate the opening; a low pitched sound will indicate the opening is near the bottom of the screen, and a higher pitched sound indicates the opening is near the top. If you miss the opening, the dolphin will lose speed allowing the squid to catch up to you! From time to time, a seagull may fly overhead; if you jump out of the water and touch the seagull, your dolphin will temporarily be able to chase the squid. Throughout the ocean are waves which are indicated by arrows; an arrow pointing the same direction you are travelling will boost the dolphins speed, whereas an arrow pointing the opposite direction slows you down. The longer you stay alive, the faster and trickier the squid will become! The game ends when all of your dolphins have been caught by the squid.</desc>

		<desc>Mario has kidnapped Junior's Papa!

Donkey Kong Jr. was originally released in the arcades in 1982 as a sequel to Donkey Kong.  In this game, Mario plays the antagonist, finally having captured Donkey Kong, and has put the ape in a locked cage.  As Donkey Kong Jr., players will have to make their way through four different levels (Vines, Springboard, Chains and Mario's Hideout) in an attempt to find keys to free the little monkey's Father.

Along the way, Mario will send out Snapjaws, swooping purple birds, and electric sparks in an attempt to stop Junior.  Junior can defend himself by dropping fruit found around the levels on the heads of his foes.  The more foes a piece of fruit hits in a falling sequence, the higher bonus points can be scored.

Junior can also avoid enemies more easily by grabbing hold of two chains or vines at a time to climb away faster, or by jumping over his foes.  However, any long fall or falling into the water on certain levels will mean the loss of a life for Junior.

In the final cut scene, Junior will free Donkey Kong and both will escape after giving Mario the boot.  Once all four levels are cleared, the game levels will start over at a higher difficulty.

Like the original Donkey Kong, the earlier 1980's console versions do not have all of the levels and animations from the arcade.</desc>

		<name>Donkey Kong</name>
		<desc>Released in the arcades in 1981, Donkey Kong was not only Nintendo's first real smash hit for the company, but marked the introduction for two of their most popular mascots: Mario (originally "Jumpman") and Donkey Kong.

Donkey Kong is a platform-action game that has Mario scale four different industrial themed levels (construction zone, cement factory, an elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from girders) in an attempt to save the damsel in distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the timer runs out.  Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited.  From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty.

Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, "living" fireballs, and spring-weights.  Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time.  Additionally, Mario can also find Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points.

Donkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story.  It should also be noted that in versions of the game for early 1980's consoles, Donkey Kong only used 2-3 of the original levels, with the cement factory usually omitted.</desc>

Over time, the amulet imbued the dragon with cunning and power so that it began to spread treachery and evil about the peaceful Kingdom.

		<name>Dragster</name>
		<desc>Dragster is a drag racing simulation for one or two players. The object of the game is to be the first car to race across the screen in the two player game, or to race across the screen in the shortest possible time in a one player game. The joystick acts as both the gas peddle and clutch; you have the ability to shift from first through fourth, but be careful not to shift too soon because you can't downshift! You must also be careful not to rev your engine too much, or you'll blow your engine and be out of the race. There are two game variations included; in the simpler game, you just need to drive straight to reach the goal. In the advanced variation, you also have the ability to steer and need to keep your car driving straight between the bleachers and road divider.</desc>

Like any good dungeon there are secret passages hidden behing some walls. Along the way you will come across the Cave of the Dead and also the Lake of Fire. The is a huge variety of animated monsters to fight as you make your way to the princess at the bottom of the dungeon.

		<name>Eli's Ladder</name>
		<desc>This game was designed to help teach children addition, subtraction and counting. Eli needs to return to his spaceship. You move him up the ladder by solving addition or subtraction problems. A problem appears with four answer choices below. Move the joystick left or right to select your answer then press the button. After 20 questions, Eli reaches his ship. If you got 18 or more answers correct, Eli will jump for joy and there will be a flashing word WOW.

The child always uses the right joystick. In two player settings, the left joystick is used by the parent to advance to the next problem, start the game and count apples. In one player, you advance automatically.

The left difficulty switch is used to select one or two player. The right difficulty switch is used to select addition or subtraction. These must be selected at the main menu before you begin your game. The game select switch returns you to the main menu if you are in a game or changes the game number on the main menu. The TV Type switch switches in and out of the counting screen in a game or set the speed of the pacer (timer) on the main menu.

There are three types of games, each with up to ten difficulty levels. In game type one, called Practice, there is no time limit. The child can take as long as needed to answer the problem. In game type two, called Pacer, there will be a plus or minus sign at the bottom that moves from left to right. If it reaches the right side barrier, the problem is marked as wrong then it is on to the next problem. You can set the pacer speed from the main menu with the TY Type switch. If your difficulty level allows for counting, when you switch to the counting apples screen, the timer stops and when you return, it resets. In game type three, called Phantom, in addition to having a time limit, the only answer selection that shows is the one that the arrow is under.</desc>

		<path>./Elk Attack (USA) (Proto).zip</path>
		<name>Elk Attack</name>
		<desc>With a name like Elk Attack you'd probably expect a game involving herds of deadly rampaging elk right?  Well I hate disappoint you but there aren't herds of rampaging elk in this game, in fact this game has nothing to do with elks at all!  Elk Attack is really a port of the obscure Taito arcade game Electric Yo-Yo! Programmer Mark Hahn named the game Elk Attack as a joke, and probably would have changed the name had it been published.

Silly name aside, Elk Attack is really a Pac-Man type game but without a maze.  You control a Yo-Yo type machine, which must use its string to latch onto and destroy all the colored blocks on the screen.  Along the way you'll encounter strange worm like creatures (sorry no elks), which will attempt to disrupt your Yo-Yo.  To help you fight the worms there are power squares scattered around the board which when grabbed will render your Yo-Yo temporarily invincible and increase your speed.   However unlike Pac-Man touching a worm while invincible will only net you points, and will not destroy of them.  Because of this its best to just go about your business and clear the maze instead of hunting down the worms.

Since you use your string as your main means of propulsion, you must be careful as the screen becomes more and more open. For once you latch onto a block you can't let go until you touch it.  The most common way of dying is to accidentally latch onto a block on the other side of the screen and be sucked into a waiting enemy.  Clearing the board in a set pattern is the best way to avoid leaving large (and potentially dangerous) gaps between blocks.</desc>

When you take a step, it move, too.  Interesting. There is a button and stick. When you press the button, you see the walls of part of a maze. Moving the stick lets you look at more maze. All very well but you note that there is a timer counting down. You have a suspicion that when it ends, so will you.

You begin in a maze on the lower left corner. You can move anywhere but cannot pass through walls or the outer perimeter. If you press fire, you can see a spotlighted area of the maze and by holding down the button, you can move the joystick around to see more maze. You must find the exit before the timer, which begins counting down as soon as you move, reaches zero. In the maze, there is a box that will give you more time. If the timer reaches zero, game is over. Once you exit the maze, you get any remaining time as your score. If you never used the spotlight in that maze, your score is doubled.</desc>

		<desc>Using an anti-matter launcher, you must defend the starbase L5 against a non-stop horde of blue Megalyte warrior ships and their death ships. As the warriors reach the bottom, they fire on your base. It does not hurt the base but would lose you one of your four lives. Sometimes the death ship takes a dive towards your base, firing as it goes. If it reaches your base, it will destroy your generator, losing you a life.

As hordes of Megalye ships descend, you can hold down the fire button. This will keep the anti-matter launcher in place and moving the paddle will shift the cursor and thus your aim. If you are in danger of being shot or need to destroy a death ship, just release the button and then you can move the launcher left or right.

There are 26 game variations. The odd numbered ones are one player, the even numbered are two player.

Scoring
You score ten points for each death ship you destroy
Your points vary for the warrior ships. The farther from you they are, the more the points.</desc>

At the bottom of the screen is an odometer, so when the race is finally over you can see how far you made it.</desc>

		<desc>What started out as a nice little archaeological expedition has suddenly become a nightmarish fight for survival! A team of archaeologists is trapped in an underground maze of dark, winding tunnels. All around them, fearsome zombies are emerging from the crypts. The archaeologists' only hope of survival (apart from some very fast running) is an ancient device known as the 'make-break', which can be used to either create or destroy pieces of wall.

In this increasingly frantic one or two-player arcade game, you'll need wits as well as dexterity. You'll have to think on the fly, plan strategically and race through the maze as fast as you can. Fail to keep up the pace and you're zombie fodder. Good luck!</desc>

After you destroy ten towers, a tunnel will open so you can get underground. You will have three chances to get underground. If you choose to remain above ground, the firing rate of the enemies doubles.

Underground, the tunnel narrows after a time. If, after you hit ten towers underground, the firing speed doubles.

Points:
Hitting a tall above ground tower=50 points
Hitting a short above ground tower=20 points
Hitting an underground tower=50 to 360 points
Getting through tunnel safely without hitting a tower=20 points

After a certain amount of towers are hit, the ground turns from green to blue. When this happens, if you hit ten towers, you get an extra man. You can only have a maximum of eight extra men.</desc>

There are also helpful items as well; some phases have numerous blood cells (don't shoot these, the patient needs them!) and enzymes (shoot these to release their healing properties). When you make it past all of the obstacles and through the narrow passage ways, the blood clot can be found; once destroyed you move on to the next level. If you crash too many times or fail to destroy the clot, the patient dies and the game is over. Several game options are included which control the difficulty and length of each level.</desc>

Up to two prizes will be on the screen at any one time on any floor but the top one. There are a max on ten prizes per screen. On each floor, a Sneaker stands or roams back and forth. You move to another floor or jump to avoid the Sneakers. On the top floor is High-Top, the tallest Sneaker.

You have to get at least nine prizes. After you get the ninth, High-Top will be low enough to jump over. You then jump over him to get the key above him. Then it is on the the next screen.

You get ten points for the first prize, twenty for the second, and so on up to ninety points for prizes nine and ten. You don't HAVE to get the tenth prize unless you want the extra ninety points.

After every screen, you get an extra Eddie; up to a maximum of three in reserve.</desc>

		<name>Final Approach</name>
		<desc>You are an air traffic controller at an international airport. You must guide planes in to landing safely.

Your first screen is the Approach Control Radar screen or ARC. You must guide the aircraft , using the cursor, until they are headed left to right along the yellow line headed towards the black stripe. Make sure the other planes are headed where they won't immediately head towards each other or off screen.

After the plane gets near the black stripe, move the cursor to the center red light and press the button. You will then be on the Ground Control Approach screen or GCA.  Here you must center the plane's nose on the glide slope and localizer before it arrives at the end of the runway. If the landing is successful, the plane will disappear from the ARC screen and a new one will appear soon to take its place. If not, when you press your joystick button and return to the ARC screen, the plane will still be there. If a plane starts flashing on the ARC and you hear an emergency sound, this plane has an emergency and must be landed first.

Scoring
Successful landing=25 points
Successful emergency landing if landing before other planes=50 points
Aircraft wanders off radar=lose 5 points

You get a control error (lose a life) if you allow a near miss or do not immediately land an aircraft in distress. You are allowed an additional control error (extra life) every 500 points.

Game variations
Games 1, 3, 5, and 7 are one player.
Games 2, 4, 6,  and 8 are two player.

Maximum number of planes on radar:
Games 1, 2, 3, and 4=4
Games 5 and 6=3
Games 7 and 8=2

There are crosswinds on landings in games 3 and 4 only.

Your goal is to save the worker who is trapped in the warehouse; on the right side of the screen is a firetruck with an adjustable ladder. You can move the ladder to the appropriate floor of the building to climb up and rescue the trapped worker. Depending on which floors have caught fire, the worker will move to the lowest floor he can which isn't burning; you'll need to estimate which floor he'll be on when you position the ladder. Once the worker is safe, you move on to the next (more challenging) level. The fire in the building may spread quickly! If necessary, you can use a fire hose to put out the fire. Of course, you have a limited supply of water so make sure you don't run out! As the levels progress, the building becomes shorter and the fire spreads faster which means you don't have as much time in which to rescue the trapped victims.</desc>

Using the joystick you can move your explorer around the grid; on any square you can press the button to see if the flag is located in that square, or if not to receive a clue as to the flags location. If the square doesn't contain the flag, one of several items may appear: an arrow indicating what direction the flag is, a number indicating how many squares away the flag is, or a bomb which will cause you to have to start again. In the one player game your goal is to locate as many flags as possible in the 75 second time limit. There are several varieties of two players games: in free-for-all, both players can move around the grid simultaneously and whomever finds the flag first scores a point. In the other two player games, players take turns moving around the grid. Several skill levels are available which control the players moving speed, allow the flag to be stationary or move, or add an invisible wall around the playfield.</desc>

		<name>FlapPing</name>
		<desc>"The future of gaming can be summed up in two words -- Pong and Joust." ...with these prophetic words on rec.games.video.classic, "Otter" planted the seeds for the game you see before you now. FlapPing, at its core, is an oldschool Pong Deathmatch... but with a "Flap" button. Each player flaps furiously to prevent the opponent from getting a ball past and scoring a point--first to 10 points win (3 points in a "poorlords" game).

FlapPing features two primary game variations, a "classic pong" mode which resembles the classic Pong arcade game, and "poorlords", where each player must defend a wall in a manner similar to the arcade game Warlords. You can play another human, or take on all the AI might of your Atari 2600. The Pterodactyl of Joust also makes an appearance in FlapPing, adding an unpredictable element to the gameplay!

FlapPing is descended from JoustPong, the name Kirk Israel originally chose for his original homebrew game. Unfortunately, this name stepped on the Pong trademark owned by Atari, and in early 2005 he renamed the game top FlapPing so it could once again be sold in the AtariAge Store, complete with a new label and manual designed by Dave Exton.</desc>

		<name>Flash Gordon</name>
		<desc>You are Flash Gordon. Many spacemen have entered Spider City but never returned. Your job, Flash, is two fold. Rescue any spacemen you find in the tunnels of Spider City and destroy all the hatching pods.

The lower part of the screen is a map. You are the horizontal line, the hatching pods are the vertical lines and the Disrupters are the crosses. The upper part of the screen is the close-up of the action.

You rescue spacemen by touching them with your ship. You destroy hatching pods, and the spider warriors that hatch, by flying to the pods then shooting the warriors.

You can also shoot generators, patrol ships and debris. Shooting the generator will keep the Disrupter from moving about the city for a little bit but the debris never stops while you are within, so don't hang out in the Disrupter.

If you destroy five warriors at one hatching pod or your ship is destroyed when it returns, you will have a shield for a short time. There will be two beeps to warn you of the shield leaving.

The scoring is as follows:
10 points = Debris
25 points = Patrol Ship
70 points = Rescued Spaceman
100 points = Disrupter Generator

You get 100 points for killing the first warrior at a pod, 200 for the second, 300 for the third and so on.

You lose 1,000 points if you shoot a spaceman, but Flash Gordon would never do that, right?

Every time you conquer a city, you get an extra man.</desc>

You must make your way two screens to the right to get to your tree. Animals will come at you from either side of the screen. You must either jump over the animal or press your button and push the joystick in the desired direction to chop them with your axe. Snakes cannot be chopped, only jumped over. 

Also to contend with is a bird in the air that is dropping stones. If you are hit by a stone, you will be unable to move for two seconds, which could prove fatal. Once you reach the tree, you must chop it down while still avoiding the animals. It takes four chops per side to fell the tree. If you need to, you can climb the tree to avoid animals. Once the tree is chopped, the game restarts at a faster level. You have only one life so if an animal touches you, it is game over.</desc>

Your only chance is to gather stones from the dungeon and bring them to the tower where you must build a barricade around the monster before he has accumulated enough energy to come alive.

You start at the top floor of the castle and must make your way to the dungeon to get a stone to wall in the monster, all the while avoiding ghosts, giant tarantulas, trapdoors, spiders and a pool of acid. Once you have the stone, you must make your way back to the top, again avoiding these obstacles. When you get near the monster, you switch to a new screen where you must make your way past bats to place the stone. You must do this four times and each time gets harder, with more ghosts, more and bigger tarantulas, and a harder to cross acid pool.

You have three lives and falling into the acid pool will lose you one. You are also timed (see Difficulty settings) and you are trying to get and not lose points.

Game variations
The only variation is one or two players

Difficulty switches
Left for player one, right for player two
Set to A for a five minute timer. Set to B for an eight-and-a-half minute timer.

Scoring
You start with five hundred points.
If you touch a ghost, tarantula or spider, you lose 20 points
If you touch a bat, you lose 10 points
If you fall through a trapdoor, you lose 100 points
If you fall in the pool of acid, you lose 200 points as well as one life
Each stone you place gets you 500 points
If you place all four stones, you get a 100 point bonus for each unit of time saved.</desc>

		<path>./Frog Pond (USA) (Proto).zip</path>
		<name>Frog Pond</name>
		<desc>The history behind Frog Pond is a little hazy, it's either a victim of bad timing or of management/programmer dispute.  The premise behind Frog pond is simple, you control a frog who must try and catch various insects with its tongue in a race to see how many points you can score.  The game subject and total lack of difficulty almost guarantee that it was to going to be aimed at small children, much like Nick Tuner's previous game Demons to Diamonds.  The problem with children's games is that they're really not alot of fun for adults to play, and Frog Pond is no exception. 

If Frog Pond looks familiar to you it's probably because it's an almost exact copy of Mattel's Frog Bog, which was released for the 2600 as Frogs and Flies under the M-Network label.  According to Nick Turner, this is a completely coincidence and neither company had any idea what the other had been working on.  According to Nick he wanted to add more options and gameplay to the game, expanding it to 8K.  Atari wasn't keen on spending the extra money on more memory for a children's game, and refused to allocate the extra 4K.  Frog Pond was shelved and Nick left Atari shortly afterwards.

As you might expect the gameplay is very simple.  Every time you press the fire button, your frog jumps and shoots out his tongue.  If your tongue hits an insect you score points and your frog gets a pleasant snack.  The are several different insects to catch, which are worth varying amounts of points.

While the larger insects are slightly faster than the smaller ones, they still don't put up much of fight.  However if you take too long to grab your bug he'll fly away.  If you miss six insects the sun sets and the games ends. </desc>

		<name>Frogger</name>
		<desc>Your task in this arcade conversion is to guide a frog across a treacherous road and river, and to safety at the top of the screen. Both these sections are fraught with a variety of hazards, each of which will kill the frog and cost you a life if contact is made.

The road is full of cars and trucks, at variable speeds. The river water itself is fatal, as are the snakes which hover within on later levels. Frogger must use the arrangement of logs, turtles (which are only there for a short time) and alligators (but stay away form their faces), and then jump into one of the open home-cells, ideally one containing a fly for extra points. Once all holes have been filled, you move onto the next, harder, level.</desc>

		<desc>Front Line is a vertically scrolling action game. Your mission is to infiltrate enemy territory and destroy their fortress. To reach the fortress, you will have to make your way through varied and dangerous terrain. Jungles, deserts, brush, and rocks all slow your progress, plus each area has numerous enemy fighters and tanks trying to stop you. To help get past these obstacles, you are armed with a machine gun and grenades; at some points in the game you may even come across an abandoned tank which you can control to increase your odds of survival. When you reach the end of the level and successfully destroy the fortress, the game will repeat at a higher level of difficulty. Gameplay is for one or two players, and four different skill levels are available.</desc>

		<desc>S.B.I. (Spectravision Bureau of Investigation) file on Chicago Joe and his gang:
We apprehended Chicago Joe but in retaliation, his gang have holed up in an apartment building, taking hostage a dame and her kid. The following men have been positively identified:

Shifty
2. Scar Face
3. Mugsy
4. Lefty
5. Nitro Ed

Your orders are to snipe any gang member. DO NOT SHOOT AN INNOCENT! Watch out for Nitro Ed. He likes to play with hand grenades. One of those and you're pushing up daisies. Good luck.

You move the joystick to aim at a gangster and push the button to fire. Your ammo is limited so don't fire randomly. Occasionally, Nitro Ed, on the roof, will hold up a grenade. You must shoot him to disarm him. You get money for each gangster shot. The values for level one are:

1. Mugsy=$20
2. Scare Face=$30
3. Lefty=$40
4. Shifty=$50
5. Disarming Nitro Ed=$100

These amounts increase for each level by $10.  You also get $10 for each bullet you have left after each level. There are six levels. The fourth level is a nighttime level. In this level, you must fire one bullet to light up the windows. If you do not fire for a couple seconds, they go dark again.
If you shoot an innocent, you will lose $1000 or you total amount if you have less than $1000.

If a gangster rises all the way out of a window, after a couple of seconds, he will shoot you and you will lose one bullet proof vest (life). After you lose all your vests, the game is over and Nitro Ed will laugh at you. If Nitro Ed gets off his hand grenade, no matter how many vests you have, the game is over. And Nitro Ed will laugh at you. You start with four vests and can earn another at $5000.</desc>

As you probably guessed, Garfield stars the lovable orange furball from the Sunday comics (no not Alf!).  Garfield is on a mission to find Nermal (wasn't he always trying to get AWAY from Nermal?), and to accomplish this mission he's going to have to cross five different action filled screens while keeping a looking out for the nefarious Odie!  The movement in Garfield is a bit strange, you don't move left or right with the joystick but by pressing the fire button to jump.  It takes a few tries to get the hang of it, but fits in well with the whole fence post idea.</desc>

As you go along, you can accelerate or decelerate to avoid being bombed but be careful because you might ram some ships near the ground. You can jump to avoid them or blast them for points. You will also see numbers along your way. Run into them to acquire their point value. Do not shoot them or their value will be deducted from you score.

As this is Gas Hog, you will soon run low on fuel. You must get below ground via the occasional holes, to grab a refuel marker. Do not stay below ground, however, as you travel in the wrong direction while there. You start with four lives and lose one if you are hit by a bomb or ship or run out of fuel.</desc>

You are the great explorer, Sir Robert Wittenbottom. You have discovered an ancient civilization deep within the forest of a mysterious island. Since you're a likable old fellow, they have decided to induct you into their council of warriors. But first you must prove your worthiness by running the gauntlet.

You are given three glasses of water. You must run through the gauntlet to the ceremonial fires and use your water to put them out. You current glass of water will then be refilled then it is off to the next fire.

Of course, it is not that easy. You must jump over rocks and logs, duck under stones, arrows and tomahawks, and avoid hitting trees or touching the sides of the gauntlet.You can ease the thirst of the old men you come across for points but it will cost you water. The game is over when you run out of your third glass of water. To jump, just press the fire button. To duck, pull back then press the fire button.

Scoring:
Jump over a rock or a log=50 points
Duck under an arrow, stone or tomahawk=100 points
Give an old man a drink of water=250 points
Duck under the Secret Talisman=500 points
Extinguish the ceremonial flame=500 points

Difficulty switches
Left switch:
A=joystick less responsive, more challenging
B=joystick more responsive, less challenging

Dracula guards this floor, and using the crosses you collected earlier you need to repel him into a prison and free your friend.

		<name>Ghostbusters II</name>
		<desc>Ghostbusters II by Activision (the makers of the original Atari VCS Ghostbusters game) never even hit a store shelf in the United States. With the video game market (circa 1989) having shifted toward more advanced systems like the NES and Sega Master System, Activision felt it would be wasting its time releasing a new VCS game. Yet it was released overseas by Salu. In scenes inspired by the movie of the same name, Ghostbusters II puts players in the shoes of the apparition-apprehending heroes as they descend into a slime-filled underground tunnel, trying to blast ghosts and collect samples of "mood slime." Ghosts will attack both the player's Ghostbuster and the rope he's hanging from, and the Ghostbuster's "courage" meter must be monitored as well (though that can be replenished by picking up "elixir" power-ups in the tunnel). In the game's second level, players guide a mobile Statue of Liberty through the streets of New York City (echoing the movie's goofy climax), fending off more ghosts with her fireball-shooting torch and trying to keep a steady supply of "mood slime" to keep the statue moving.</desc>

		<name>Ghostbusters</name>
		<desc>Based on the movie of the same name, the Ghostbusters are the ones to call who will "bust" any ghost hauntings. It does this through the use of nuclear accelerated "proton packs" and traps, whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility. However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal (PK) level in the city, representing ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and ressurects an evil goddess, Gozer.

Ghostbusters is an action game that combines an overhead view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor the map of New York City for "ghost alarms" as well as casual spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. The player then controls the Ghostbuster vehicle as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. Once at the location, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the ghostbusters will take position and activate their proton beams and toss a trap to the ground. The player will attempt to  maneuver the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap attempts to capture any ghosts directly above it. Successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for the vehicle. Unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away.

As the game progresses, the PK energy of the city increases. Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly  successful at ghost captures. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.</desc>

		<desc>Unrefined sugar, flour, ginger and heat have combined magically to produce consciousness and mobility in a delicious culinary confection. You, a Gingerbread Man, find yourself baking in a gas-fired oven, and you must find a way out! Gingerbread Man is based loosely on the popular childrenâs story of the same name. And although this game is appropriate for children, itâs not childâs play!

In Gingerbread Man you must fight your way through 20 levels consisting of five unique game-play screens, facing a variety of obstacles and challenges in order to survive! In the first level you begin in a hot oven where you must escape before being cooked alive! Once you break free from the oven, you find yourself in the dining room where you need to collect all of the balloons and float up to the roof through the chimney. Now that you're on the roof you must build a bridge to a nearby tree while fighting off cats and birds that want you for a tasty treat! Once in the tree, you need to evade all the dangerous creatures in the forest (will you ever get a break?) And if you do escape the forest, you enter a cave where you must fight off your most fearsome enemy yet!

Once you defeat the boss, to your dismay you are captured again and put back in the oven too cook some more, and this time the heat has been turned up! Will you ever escape? Can you battle through 19 levels to have your chance to out-fox the final boss and win your freedom?

Gingerbread Man includes three game variations:

Selection 1 is the default.
Selection 2 is expert mode.
Selection 3 is a special mode for children.</desc>

		<path>./Glib - Video Word Game (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Glib : Video Word Game</name>
		<desc>This is a version of Scrabble for the Atari 2600.

The letters on the top row are shuffled and then you use them to make words on the bottom row. If the bottom row shows all spaces in pink or red, then the points for the word are doubled or tripled, respectively. If there is a light blue or blue line under a space, then the points for that letter are doubled or tripled, respectively. After you create a word, move down to the E button and press the red joystick button one time. This stops the timer so you can confirm the word is acceptable. If the word is acceptable, press the button again to collect points and go to the next round. If not, move to the P button to pass on the word and go to the next round. In a two player game, after you press the E button once, the other player then must press the button again to enter the word. Play continues until you have 14 rounds in a one player game or 7 each in a two player game.

Difficulty switches
Use the left switch to set the number of players; B for one player, A for two.

Game variations
There are five games, each with five skill levels.
The skill levels differ by the amount of time you have to make words.
Skill levels for one player games:
Skill level 1=unlimited time (no clock)
Skill level 2=132 seconds
Skill level 3=39 seconds
Skill level 4=26 seconds
Skill level 5=random times
For two player games, the times are half of what they are in one player.

The games are:
Game 1 (Billboard): After each round, all the letters are reshuffled, so you get a whole new set of seven letters. Any letters that were not used go back into the mix.
Game 2 (Skill Builder): Only the letters you used to make the word are replaced. Any unused letters stay on the top spaces.
Game 3 (Times Up): You are given seven letters only. You must use these seven to make as many words as you can.
Game 4 (Encore): The letters on the top row all shift to the right, with the last letter disappearing and a new letter plopping into the first spot. You must grab you letters and place them quickly. Any letters the you don't use will reappear randomly again.
Game 5 (Over the Edge): Same as game 4 but letters that disappear never return.</desc>

		<desc>Golf features a nine hole, par 36 course which can be played by one or two players. The game is played from an overhead view of the course, which is complete with sand traps, water hazards, trees, and rough. The player doesn't have the ability to choose different clubs, so the distance the ball travels is controlled by how big of a backswing is taken. The direction is controlled by the location of the player in relation to the ball. When the player finally reaches the green, the view switches to a closeup of the green for putting. Two different skill levels are available which control the size of the cup and the amount of power lost in the rough or sand.</desc>

		<desc>A pesky gopher is after your carrot patch! Your goal is to stop it before all of your carrots are gone. The gopher will be tunneling in the ground at the bottom of the screen; you are at the top and need to fill in the gophers tunnels with your shovel. The gopher is fast, however, and if you don't fill in the tunnels quick enough it will make it to the surface and run off with one of your carrots! If the gopher manages to take all of your carrots, the game will be over. From time to time there will be a duck that flies overhead. As the duck passes by, it will drop a seed; if you catch the seed and plant it, a new carrot will grow to replace one of the ones that was stolen. Several difficulty levels are included, which control the speed and intelligence of the gopher, and whether or not the duck will appear.</desc>

		<name>Gorf</name>
		<desc>Gorf is a game similar to Space Invaders, alien vessels approach closer and closer in their threatening row formation.

The game itself consists of four levels:

1. The first level has you behind a defensive shield, defending against an alien attack. The level is a top-down view, with your ship &amp; shield on one side and the aliens on the other side;

The second level is similar to the first, only your defensive shield is gone, and the enemies tend to swoop down over the level as opposed to those row formations. Bonus ships also tend to appear in this level;

The third level is a change, and has you entering hyperspace. Your only goal is to survive to the end of your journey. The viewpoint switches from a top-down view to a behind-the-ship view and in effect you are heading "towards" your destination. Alien vessels flying in circular formation try to stop you;

The fourth and final level is similar to the first again, with some key differences. You do not fight a wave of enemies, but a single one. A mothership with a glowing weak spot. Hitting the weak spot will instantly destroy it. The mothership also has that same shield that was yours in the first level.

Finishing the game increases your rank and starts the game over at level 1 with a faster game speed for more challenge.</desc>

With each galaxy he conquers he leaves behind extreme gravitational forces, a powerful, explosive reactor and deadly bunkers. Your job is to stop Gravitar by taking back the twelve solar systems located in four galaxies that are under his control! In each solar system there is a sun, an alien reactor base, and three to four planets. To free the solar system, you have two choices; either visit all of the planets and destroy all enemy bunkers, or activate the reactor at the core of the alien base and escape before it explodes. On each of the planets and the alien base, there will be strong gravitational forces to deal with; make sure you keep your ship in space, since a crash into the ragged landscape will be fatal! After a galaxy has been freed, you then automatically move on to the next galaxy which will be even more difficult to save. The game includes five different skill levels which vary in difficulty by supplying different amounts of ships to begin the game as well as different strengths of gravity.</desc>

As Roderick Hero, you need to make your way through the dangerous mineshaft avoiding the dangerous creatures and lava, and find out where the miners are located before you run out of energy. To help on your mission, Roderick Hero has several useful types of equipment. A prop pack will allow you to hover and fly around the mineshaft and (hopefully) avoid the many dangers within. Your helmet features a short range microlaser beam which can be used to destroy the bats, spiders, snakes, and other creatures you'll encounter in the mines. From time to time, your path through the mine may be blocked by stone or lava walls. You begin each mission with six sticks of dynamite which can be used to destroy these obstacles (be careful you don't blow yourself up, though!) If you run out of dynamite, your laser beam can also be used to destroy the walls, though this will take longer and use up more energy. As the levels progress, the mine shaft will become longer and more maze-like, creatures will more frequently block the path, and lava walls and pools will appear which are dangerous to the touch.</desc>

		<desc>Hidden throughout a haunted mansion are three pieces of a magical urn, and your goal is to enter the mansion and retrieve all three before you lose your nine lives! The game is played from an overhead point of view where you see only your eyeballs as you explore the  four floors of the maze-like mansion. To make your mission even more difficult, there are various creatures wandering throughout. Tarantulas, giant vampire bats, and one fast moving ghost will all cause you to lose a life if encountered too closely. As a defense against the creatures, a magical scepter can be found in the mansion which will make you immune to its inhabitants.

The mansion contains many doors, some of which may be locked; to explore all the rooms, you will first need to find the master key which is hidden somewhere. The mansion is very dark, and you will not be able to see any of the objects in it (and in more difficult game variations, you can't see the walls either). To reveal objects and the mansion walls, you need to light one of your unlimited supply of matches which will light up a small area around you. Don't be surprised if a swift wind or passing creature blow out your match, though!

You are only allowed to carry one object at a time so you will need to create a strategy for exploring the mansion; to unlock a door or move a piece of the urn, you will need to put down the scepter so be careful! You win the game when all three pieces of the urn are assembled and you make it out of the mansion. The game keeps track of how many matches you have used on your mission, and the fewer matches the better the score!</desc>

		<desc>The game can be played against the computer or with another player. You have the option to have 1, 2 or 3 players in the field. As a pitcher, you use the joystick to throw the ball and to control its speed and curve. After the ball is hit, your control all your men (they all move together since they follow the orders of a single joystick) in the field to catch the ball. As a batter, you can control the position of the baseball bat with the joystick. If you consider that your runners would make it to the next base, you can press the controller button so they stop at their current base. 

The rest of the rules are basically like real baseball. Each team has nine innings in a game. You are out after three strikes, your get to first base after four balls (balls that do not fly over Home) or if the pitcher hits you with a ball. In the field, you can put out a batter by catching his ball, then another runner by reaching his next base before him or simply by touching him between bases, thus completing a double play. The only way to accomplish a home run is by hitting the ball over second base without having it caught by the field players. You score a point for each runner that reaches Home base after each of the first three.</desc>

The gameplay in question involves a progression through 14 levels

		<desc>Hunt &amp; Score is similar to the game Memory. The player is presented with a numbered grid; behind each grid section is a picture. On each turn, the player chooses two grid sections in an attempt to find two matching pictures. Points are earned for finding matching pictures, and the player with the most points at the end wins. Several game options include a 16 or 30 square game grid, the ability to handicap one of the players, and the ability to enable or disable wild cards.</desc>

		<desc>You are a member of those elite combat specialists, the Ikari Warriors. Your buddy and you are on a special mission behind enemy lines, and you've been sleeping, eating, and breathing jungle combat for the last two weeks. Your tired, but that never affect your razor-sharp judgement and your will to survive.

Your main weapons are machine guns, grenades, and your own cunning in the face of danger. Sometimes you'll have a tank at your disposal, which comes in handy when enemy fire is particularly brutal.

You move swiftly through the jungle, wading through rivers and resting from time to time with the ruins of bombed-out buildings. You're turning out of ammunition and grenades but you know the battle can't last forever. Sooner or later, one side is going to emerge victorious. Let's just hope it's yours!</desc>

In the two player game, the first player to complete 25 laps wins! Included are several different race tracks, two difficulty levels, and additional game variations called ice race, tag, and crash 'n score. In ice race, the track is icy causing your car to slide often and making it difficulty to steer.  In tag, one player is "it" and needs to tag the other player. For each second you race without being tagged, a point is earned. Lastly, in crash 'n score the goal is to crash into targets which appear on the race track. The first player to crash into the target earns a point, and then a new target will appear elsewhere on the track.</desc>

		<name>Ixion</name>
		<desc>Ixion is a port of the unreleased 1983 Sega coin-op of the same name, Ixion is an interesting game that doesn't seem to play like anything else in the 2600 library. Your goal in Ixion is to grab the five white squares scattered across the screen and spell the word Ixion before your time runs out. At the start of each level only certain squares are visible, and to get around more easily you must first reveal the missing squares. To reveal the missing squares, the player must move a brown sphere over an empty square. This sphere is normally stationary, but it can be moved by shooting or ramming into it. This sends the sphere bouncing around the screen, revealing squares and destroying enemies in its travels. After a short time of bouncing around the sphere will stop, requiring the player to move it again to reveal more squares. Learning how to move the sphere where you want is the key to mastering Ixion. Also moving around the game grid are enemy drones, which will attempt to destroy your ship. Unfortunately, their shots destroy tiles, making your path much more difficult to traverse. Enemy drones only take one shot to defeat, but will take out the tile they are on when they explode.</desc>

Each horizontally scrolling level in the game is loosely based on a different James Bond movie. The levels included are Diamonds Are Forever, The Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker, and For Your Eyes Only. Each level has a variety of enemies trying to destroy you, and a unique goal that must be accomplished to continue on (for example, you may have to land on a hidden oil rig to stop Seraffino, or find Stromberg's undersea laboratory and destroy it). If you can complete all the missions, you win the game! Good luck, Mr. Bond.</desc>

You start with $50,000 from the concert and need to guide one band member at a time; the screen scrolls vertically, and you need to get past the crowds and various obstacles before time runs out. Trying to slow you down are numerous fans, reporters, promoters, and photographers. Running into each of these will cause you to lose some of the money you start with, and also precious time! Stage barriers and fences will also cause you to lose time, but you won't lose any money if you hit one of these. To help you out, roadies and your manager are also in the crowds. They will give you temporary invulnerability allowing you to run straight through any obstacles. The game ends when a band member doesn't make it to the escape vehicle before the timer runs out. As the game advances, there will be bigger and bigger crowds to avoid, and they will be more aggressive about getting in your way!</desc>

		<desc>In Joust, players take control of a knight with a lance who rides their flying ostrich (or stork, for Player 2) to do battle against computer-controlled evil knights who ride atop vultures.

Players must flap their steed's wings to hit the enemy from a higher jousting point to destroy the vulture and its rider. Once the enemy has been hit, an egg falls to one of the platforms below. The heroic knights must destroy the eggs before they hatch and release new and increasingly more difficult knights. The three strengths of enemy knights are Bounder (red knight), Hunter (white knight), and Shadow Lord (blue knight). These enemy knights are not the only challenge to be found in the game. Players must also contend with crumbling platforms, lava trolls who attempt to pull knights into the fire, and the dreaded "unbeatable"(?) pterodactyl.

The game was novel for its time for being one of the few two-player simultaneous games in the arcade.</desc>

As Jr., you need to eat all of the dots in a maze without running into the four ghosts that are trying to get you. The maze is now much larger, and no longer fits on a single screen. The maze will scroll around to follow the action. From time to time a tasty bonus will bounce around the screen which can be eaten for extra points. There are tricycles, kites, drums, balloons, trains, root beers, and other bonuses that appear as the levels progress. When the bonus items bounce around the screen, any dots they touch will become larger and are now worth 50 points each instead of 10. However, one of these larger dots will cause Jr. Pac-Man to slow down greatly when he eats them making it more difficult to remain one step ahead of the ghosts which constantly pursue him! Located throughout the maze are power pellets; when Jr. eats one of these, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and can now be eaten to earn even more points.</desc>

		<desc>Jungle Hunt offers four unique adventure experiences, which repeat with greater difficulty once all four have been survived.  If you don't survive these adventures, you will not only lose your own life but that of the lovely Penelope, who has been captured by cannibals!

The first part challenges your Tarzan skills - can you swing on the vines without plummeting to your doom?  The second part pits you against a whole bunch of nasty crocodiles in a mighty river.  Fortunately, you have a knife to fight back with.  Don't forget to go up for air!  In the third part, you face a battle against oncoming boulders of varying sizes and physics.  Once you've cleared all these treacherous hazards, you still must confront the dreaded cannibal, who is armed with a wicked spear.  Can you get past him and save the lovely Penelope?

Gameplay involves much strategic jumping and knife play (in the river/crocodile phase).  The view is always a side view, much like Pitfall! and later platform games.</desc>

		<desc>Kabobber was originally a prototype game that was programmed by Rex Bradford, known for his work on Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back and Star Wars: Jedi Arena. It was discovered in 2000 and improved upon a little before being released to the public in ROM format. Kabobbers are strange (but cute) little creatures who just love wreaking havoc. Your objective is to send in your Buvskies to krush the Kabobbers before they krush you. You can have up to nine Buvskies onscreen at one time, but you have reserves waiting offscreen should one get krushed. You move your Bruvskies across the grid, jumping on enemy Kabobbers in order to defeat them and earn additional reserve Bruvskies. The baby Bruvskies become big ones when they defeat an enemy. The enemies get tougher and tougher, meaning very good timing is required in the later stages. Above all, you must reach Princess Buvsky before she reaches the rainbow energy at the other end of the level and devours it. A very unique game, but also somewhat fun.</desc>

		<path>./Kamikaze Saucers (USA) (Proto).zip</path>
		<name>Kamikaze Saucers</name>
		<desc>Kamikaze Saucers was a little known 2600 game that most people assumed was never even started.  However after the programmer gave the rom image to Atari Age to be distributed to the gaming community, the game proved to be very much real.  There was no mention of Kamikaze Saucers on any game list, but Syncro did take out full page ads for the game so they must have been close to releasing it.  All these things make this prototype all the more interesting, and makes one wonder what other games Syncro may have had in the works.

Kamikaze Saucers is your average shooter along the lines of Atlantis or Demon Attack.  You must shoot down the saucers that buzz across the screen using your oversized phallic looking ship.  If if fail to shoot the saucers down in a timely manner they will go Kamikaze on you big time!  Three large ships will come at you from the top of the screen, and if you can't destroy them before they crash into you you'll lose a life.

Thankfully there's a little more to Kamikaze Saucers than mindless shooting.  Notice the two meters on each side of the screen?  These are your ammo meters, the left meter is for shooting from the left and the right meter for shooting on the right.  For some reason, shooting from the center counts as shooting from the left (as far as ammo is concerned).  The shooting in KS is a bit like Atlantis, all your shots are aimed towards the center of the screen.  So shooting from the left or right will cause your shots to angle towards the center like shooting from Atlantis's side guns.  This takes a bit to get used to, but actually makes the game more challenging.</desc>

Harry is trapped in a four story mall, and is running as fast as he can to reach the exit at the top. Your job is to catch up to him and send him to prison. You will need to use either the escalators at the end of each floor, or the elevator in the middle to go from floor to floor. The escalators may be further away, but the elevator moves pretty slowly so you will need to decide which route will be faster in getting you closer to your goal. If Harry can make it to the top before you catch him, you will have to retry that level. Harry has no intention of letting you catch him easily, and is hurling everything he can find in an attempt to slow you down. Shopping carts, bouncing balls, biplanes, and more will all be flying past on the screen and will either slow you down or send you back to the beginning if you get hit. As the levels progress, Harry will run faster and faster, and more objects will be tossed your way to duck and jump over.</desc>

This game is a clone of Donkey Kong, except instead of barrels, you must avoid bombs. You must make your way across the floors and up the ladders while jumping over bombs for points and holes in the floor. There is also a timer in the upper right.

Occasionally, Kong will release a magic bomb that gives more points when you jump it as well as moves you to the next floor up. Once you reach the top floor, the game starts again but faster.</desc>

		<name>Krull</name>
		<desc>Krull is a multi part action game based on the movie of the same name. A beast and his army have traveled through space until finally landing on the distant planet of Krull and ravaging the entire planet. But there is a prophecy which tells of a king and queen who will someday take back the planet. These future rulers are Princess Lyssa and Prince Colwyn. But before their marrage, Princess Lyssa is captured by the beast! 

You play the part of Prince Colwyn on a mission to rescue Lyssa and destroy the beast. The game is divided up into several parts.

The first part takes place during the foiled wedding. A large number of slayers arrive at the castle, and you need to defeat as many as you can to earn points. But eventually Princess Lyssa is captured.

In the next section you need to ride your horse towards the Widow's web; on the way you can collect Glaives which may be used to fight the beast. Once you reach the web, you need to make your way to the cocoon at the top of the web in order to find the correct path to the Black Fortress. The crystal spider along with strands of the web make maneuvering your way around this screen a challenge. Once you know the correct path, you ride on to the Black Fortress. 

Here you need to use the Glaives you've collected to free the Princess from a prison, and then destroy the beast!  After successfully completing all tasks, the game will repeat at a more difficult skill level.</desc>

Mr. X has captured the pickpocket Sylvia and it is up to Thomas, a kung-fu master who owns a restaurant, to get her back. She is located on the top floor of Mr. X's castle and Thomas will need to fight his way to the top. Of course, this won't be easy as each floor has many opponents to get past and a floor boss at the end of each level. 

Thomas is able to move left and right, jump, duck, and punch and kick. Enemy projectiles such as knives can be kicked in the air to rebound them towards the enemy. On the top floor resides Mr. X himself.</desc>

		<name>Lady Bug</name>
		<desc>An action game in the same style as Pac-Man but very very different. Players control a ladybug who must venture around different mazes collecting all of the food pellet "x"'s. In addition to there being regular lines of wall in the maze, there are also several rotating doors that can be used to trap enemies and escape. In fact these rotating doors are the key to survival in this game.  In the center of each maze is a different enemy insect hive that will spawn out enemy creatures. An new enemy creature is spawned every time the border around the screen makes a complete "lap". Timers for the border vary upon the level, so later levels will generate new enemies faster, thus progression through the game brings smarter, faster and more quickly spawning enemies.

In addition to the collection of X's, each maze also contains a variety of powerups that come in three types: Poison, Letters and Hearts. Poison is deadly both to the player and the enemy. If the player is able to lure and enemy creature into a poison powerup, it will die and be removed from gameplay. Letters and hearts are powerups with multiple conditions: Collected at the right time they will add letters that will eventually spell words providing bonuses. However collected during the the improper time will only earn the player a few points. For most of the gameplay the colour of all powerups (except skulls which are unaffected) will be blue. But every few seconds it will cycle through yellow and then red colours. Grabbing a letter when flashing the colour will add it to that colour's word. The red word is "SPECIAL" and the yellow word is "EXTRA". Spelling the word, EXTRA gains the player an extra life, and spelling the word, SPECIAL brings the player to a special bonus round.

Hearts are best used as blue powerups as they will act as multipliers for the X's being picked up, first as 2x, then as 3x and finally as 5x. Multipliers are lost when the player dies, but letter powerups are not.</desc>

		<name>London Blitz</name>
		<desc>During WWII German bombers turned daily existence in London into a nightmare. Most bombs exploded on impact but some would sit for hours, days or weeks before detonating. It was up to the Royal Engineers to find and defuse these unexploded bombs (UXB's) before they exploded. As a Lance Corporal in the Royal Engineers, it is your job to defuse these bombs.

First, you will check your London map to see where the bombs are. Then it is defusing time. 

On the C64, you must use the joystick to cause the dial to rotate, changing the numbers next to a switch then clicking on the disarm switch at the bottom. If the number is wrong, you must change it again and keep trying. 

On the Atari 2600, you slide a sliding bar. On green bombs, the top bar controls the left switch, the middle the middle and the bottom the right.You set the slide to a spot the move to the switches and push right. On orange bombs, what slide bar controls what switch varies from bomb to bomb and on blue bombs, you can't control the switches. They just randomly change and you push right and hope you disarm in time.

The possible ranks are:
Lance Corporal
Corporal
Sargent
Staff Sargent
Warrant Officer
Second Lieutenant
First Lieutenant
Captain

At the start of the game, you can select which rank to start at, from Lance Corporal to Second Lieutenant on the C64 or from Lance Corporal to First Lieutenant on the Atari 2600.
 
Every time you disarm a bomb, you move up levels within your rank. Move up eight levels and you are promoted. If a bomb explodes in the city and causes damage, you are demoted a level in rank.

You lose the game is you are demoted below Lance Corporal or a bomb explodes while you are near it, a not-very-healthy thing to happen.

You win if you get promoted to Captain, whereupon you will be given a desk job.</desc>

		<desc>You are at the airport attempting to collect your luggage from the carousel. However, the carousel has gone out of control and is tossing luggage everywhere! You need to catch all of the luggage that is tossed out, or all of your clothes will be scattered around the airport. As the levels progress, more and more luggage will need to be caught, and the games speed increases. There are two difficulty levels available; the easier mode gives you two men to catch luggage with, and the harder mode gives you only one man. Several other game variations are also available: if the terrorist suitcase option is enabled, explosive suitcases will occasionally appear. If you don't catch these, the game immediately ends regardless of how many lives you have left. If the suitcase control option is enabled during a two player game, you are able to control the direction your opponents suitcases travel.</desc>

		<name>M.A.S.H</name>
		<desc>M*A*S*H was one of the many attempts by various software companies to take a successful movie or television show and convert it into a playable game.

In this game, you play the role of "Hawkeye Pierce," a surgeon stationed at the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital #4077 during the Korean War (1950-1953). There are two main stages in the game, each of which you must pass to move to the next round. The first mission involves rescuing injured soldiers from the battlefield with your helicopter and returning them to home base without being shot down by enemy tanks. The second mission takes place in the operating room while you are required to carefully remove bullets and shrapnel from wounded soldiers... it is very similar to the classic "OPERATION" tweezers game by Milton Bradley.

Each set of missions are repeated four times. The first player to reach 999 points wins the game. There are four different variations of games, each selectable as either one player (against the computer) or two-player mode.</desc>

		<name>Malagai</name>
		<desc>You are Commander Harrington "Harry" Crag of the starship "Endless Search". You are put into a Malagai base for repairs but now the Malagai are holding you ransom. They want your advanced technology.

There are three airlock doors per starbase. You must get the correct key for each door. Each is held by one of three Malagai. The order of which Malagai is holding which key is shown by the pictures above the starbase.

If you are away from your assigned compartment for too long, as indicated by the line at the bottom of the screen, the Malagai will attack and you will need to return to your compartment to make them friendly again. When you touch a Malagai and, if it is the correct one, get the airlock door key, the Malagai will attack and the airlock will flash, on most game variations (see below). You must then make your way to the airlock. One door will disappear and the Malagai will become friendly again. After you open the third door, it is off to the next starbase.

After the third (blue) starbase, you get an extra man.

Game Variations:
Version 1: All the Malagai have different shapes and colors
Version 2: All the Malagai have the same shape but different colors
Version 3: All Malagai are the same shape and color and the airlocks do not blink to show you got the right key.

Scoring:
Touch a Malagai while they're friendly=100 points (50 point bonus if it has the correct key)
Open airlocks one or two=100 points
Open airlock three to exit starbase orange or teal=150 points
Open airlock three to exit blue starbase=250 points

Difficulty switches set to "B"=10 seconds from compartment before Malagai attack
Difficulty switches set to "A"=15 seconds from compartment before Malagai attack</desc>

Mama brings pasta to the table. You must either eat the pasta, toss it to Frankie the cat when he is at the window, or toss it to Sergio the dog when he is under the table.

You have four lives. If you eat more than 20 plates of pasta, you will burst (literally) and lose 1 life. If more than 9 plates of pasta are placed on the table, it will collapse and you will lose 1 life.

To eat pasta, you move the joystick to the right then the left. To toss pasta to a pet, you move the joystick to the right then up or down in one smooth motion. You must throw when Mama's back is turned and the cat is in the window or the dog is in the right spot under the table. If you throw food at the floor or window when the pet is not in position or if Mama sees you throw food to a pet, she will bring 3 plates the next time. Remember, over nine plates on the table and it is arrivederci una vita (goodbye one life).

To clear a level, you must eat or toss a certain number of plates of pasta.
1=31
2=32
3=35
4=37
5=40
6=42
7=45
8=47
9=49

The point value of each plate of pasta starts at 5 at level 1 and increases by 1 point per level, to a maximum of 13 at level 9.
You get an extra life at every 1,000 points. The highest points you can reach is 9,999.</desc>

When you are on the ground, your missiles fire down and forward, at an angle. When you are in the air, your missiles fire straight ahead.

The object is to destroy enemy fighters, destroy or avoid ground-launched rockets, destroy fuel depots and destroy the enemy headquarters. Any enemy fighters that get past you will head to Sardoun and bomb a building. You will see a red flash at the top of the screen with the words "Defend" when Sardoun is in trouble.

Every second you are playing, you use one gallon on fuel. If you run out of fuel, you lose a life. You can shoot fuel tanks to replenish. If you destroy all the tanks of that depot, a prize will appear that you can shoot (but may not want to). See "Prizes" for details. Each tank destroyed is worth eighty points and ten gallons of fuel.

Each enemy fighter destroyed is worth 100 points.
Each ground rocket destroyed is worth 300 points.
Each tower of the enemy headquarters destroyed is worth 300 to 600 points. If you get them all, you get one more point.
Each tower of Sardoun destroyed is worth 100 to 400 points and ten gallons of fuel each BUT if all the towers are destroyed, you will not be able to get any more points that round and will lose a life at the end of that round.

Prizes
---------
Missile=300 points and ten gallons of fuel
Moto-fighter=300 points and ten gallons of fuel
Enemy fighter=100 points and 0 gallons of fuel *
Ground-launched rocket=70 points and 0 gallons of fuel *
Yellow palm tree=400 points and 20 gallons of fuel
Arrow=0 points and 0 gallons of fuel
Man=600 points and 20 gallons of fuel +

*=If you shoot the enemy fighter or ground-launched rocket prizes (not the enemies), it will add 7 enemy fighters and 3 ground-launched rockets to the screen, so it is not recommended.

+=If you shoot the man prize, in addition to points and fuel, you will get an extra life.</desc>

		<desc>Midnight Magic utilized the Atari 2600 joystick for performing simulated pinball functions, such as activating the flippers and shooting the ball. Moving the joystick controller down pulls the pinball machine plunger back while pressing the joystick button shoots the ball into the playfield. The left and right flippers are activated by moving the joystick controller left or right. Hitting all five drop targets at the top of the table increases the bonus multiplier (2x, 3x, and so on). Extra balls can be earned when hitting the rollover targets at the top left and right corners of the table when the bonus multiplier is activated.</desc>

		<desc>Millipedes, cousins of the Centipede, are all over the garden. This will ruin anything trying to grow there unless they are stopped. But there are other insects as well; spiders, bees, dragonflies and earwigs. Nature is dangerous. Luckily, there's a bug zapper that can shoot arrows at these insects and destroy them.

Millipede is the sequel to Centipede, and features similar gameplay, but with a new swarm of insects! The goal is to destroy the multi-segmented millipede as it traverses its way through the mushroom forest towards the bottom of the screen. When all millipede segments have been destroyed, the player will progress to the next, more difficult level. Millipedes and other creatures are all worth a different amount of points. Occasionally dynamite will appear on the screen, which will explode if shot by the bug zapper. With a well timed shot, numerous millipede segments (and other insects as well) can be taken out as they pass by.</desc>

		<desc>Bounty Bob has tracked Yukon Yohan into Nuclear Ned's uranium mine. Bob must 'claim' each section of each part of the mine...but cannot take too long in each area, or the radiation will kill him.

Taking the role of Bob, players must traverse through different types of areas inside the nuclear mine. In the first level, "Lift", Bob must walk on each part of the screen to 'claim' it. Avoid the monsters by jumping over them or grab an old miner possession to become energized and grab a mutant for points. Use the lift to reach the higher parts of the screen.

The next area is the Crusher, with the same goal as Lift but more challenging as the player must also avoid getting crushed. The last part is the Radioactive Waste, where the goal is again the same, but the player must maneuver Bob around the radioactive waste. In each screen, there is a timer in the upper right. If this timer reached zero before you claim all sections, you lose a life.

After you have beaten all three screens, they repeat but without any of the bonuses for energizing, so you must jump over or avoid all mutants.</desc>

		<path>./Mines of Minos (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Mines of Minos</name>
		<desc>You are the last mining robot on the Minos mine. Monsters have destroyed all your comrades.

As the last robot, you must traverse the mine's various levels, gathering spare parts to make more robots (extra lives). You must either avoid the monsters or blow them up with a bomb. After a few seconds, if the monster hasn't hit the bomb, it will explode harmlessly. You can only drop one bomb at a time. If a monster is killed, it will regenerate somewhere in the maze.

To deposit your spare parts, you must get to the center top or bottom of any level. To move to another level, hold your joystick button down while moving through the tunnels on either side. You can also use these tunnels, without holding down the button, to quickly get from left or right side of the maze to avoid monsters.

To win the game, get to level five and ram each of the three stationary monsters to kill them. You will need at least two spare robots as the ramming will destroy you and the monster.

In two player games, player one is the robot, player two is a monster. If the robot runs into the monster being controlled, the monster is destroyed instead of the robot. However, by pushing the joystick button, player two can switch to another monster, allowing the robot to run into an uncontrolled (and therefore deadly) monster.

Difficulty switches
Left switch for the robot, right for the monsters.
Set to A to make half speed, B for normal speed.

		<name>Miniature Golf : Arcade Golf</name>
		<desc>This is a computer game simulation of a Miniature Golf course. It attempts to refine your sense of timing and your perceptiveness in judging distance.  As in a traditional miniature golf course, a variety of obstacles are placed in your path to the "cup."  Depending on the game that is selected, the course can be played solo, or a two player competition can be initiated.

Rather than a full 18 holes, this Miniature Golf variation has a nine-hole half-course.  Your goal is clear: taking the various obstacles into account, hit the ball through the course and complete each hole by knocking the ball into the cup.  The number of attempts you make for a single hole is tallied as strokes.  While total strokes are unlimited, each hole still has a specific par assigned to it.  So ideally, you should make it your goal to not exceed the par assigned to each hole.

Using the standard joystick controller, you can position the club to adjust the strength and angle of how the ball is hit. Remember that no matter how many strokes have accrued, it is necessary to get the ball in the cup before the game continues on to the next hole.</desc>

		<desc>Missile Control is a Missile Command-style game. The player has to defend their cities from incoming bombs fire by alien spaceships.

The player controls a cursor on the screen which indicates the direction of fire for the defense missiles. Once launched, they travel in a straight line from the launcher through the point the player specified until they hit an object. Each level is won by destroying all alien spaceships. The player loses once all their cities are destroyed. Bonus cities can be obtained by destroying a sufficient number of alien spacecraft.

The game gets progressively harder, for example bombs will fall faster and energy barriers might protect the aliens from the player's attacks. To get around the barriers, players can deflect their shots from large defense missiles launched at the sides of the screen.</desc>

First, you move the joystick(s) up or down to select if this opponent will be a human player or computer, a blazer or a truck and whether it will have tires or trax. Tires allow you to go over obstacles easier, trax make you bounce higher. Then on the next screen, you select weather you are going to do a competition at hard, medium or easy or whether you are going to practice one of the obstacles in the game.

Press the joystick button to accelerate. Move the joystick down to do a wheelie when on the ground. Move the joystick left and right when in the air to control your spin. Move the joystick left and right quickly to escape mud bogs. Press the joystick button and push forward to use a nitro burst if you collected them.

Difficulty switches
Only the left switch is used.
 Set it to A for a scoring game in which the player with the most points at the end of the race wins.
Set it to B for a timing race in which the first player across the finish line wins.

Scoring
If the difficulty switch is set to A, the scoring is as follows:
Landing upright and flat from a jump=5 points
Hit a wall=10 points
Crush a car=20 points
Bounce on truck tires on the platform=25 points
Jump to a collapsed ramp=25 points
Touching 50 on the screen=50 points
Finish the race first=100 points</desc>

		<desc>Deep within a multi platformed diamond mine is a valuable crown. Your goal is to locate and retrieve the crown, then make it to the top of the mine alive! There are several steps that need to be completed before you can retrieve the crown. First you need to collect enough diamonds to earn 1,000 points. After you have enough points, you need to locate the flame spirit which is hidden somewhere within the mine. Since the mine is rather dark, you carry a flashlight with you which can be used to locate objects (such as treasure chests full of diamonds and the flame spirit.) Once you have the flame spirit, you need to find the entrance to the temple the crown is in. Offer the flame spirit to the skull spirit guarding the entrance, and you can get in and take the crown. Once you have the crown, you need to make it to the top of the mine before time runs out. To make this task more challenging, numerous cave bats fly around which can steal the crown. If this happens, you need to begin again! At the very bottom of the mine is a deadly spider; if you're not careful while exploring this region of the mine, you could become caught in it's web and be eaten. Each level has a time limit, and the more levels you complete the shorter the time limit becomes!</desc>

		<desc>You control Mr. Do has he tries to harvest all of the cherries on the screen. However, there are numerous bad guys out to get him! Mr. Do can defend himself from the badguys in two ways: first he can push the apples located throughout the playfield on top of the enemies and crush them. Secondly, Mr. Do is armed with a power ball. This can be thrown to destroy an enemy. Mr. Do has only one power ball, though, so he will need to wait for it to return to him before it can be used again. From time to time an alpha monster will appear on the screen bearing one of the letters in EXTRA. If you use the power ball to destroy an alpha monster you earn that letter; when you've earned the complete word EXTRA you receive an extra life. When you successfully collect all of the cherries, you will move on to the next, more difficult level.

The mobile version of the game includes the original arcade version, as well as an enhanced mode with new levels, power-ups and graphics.</desc>

		<name>Mr. Do!'s Castle</name>
		<desc>Mr. Do!'s Castle is an action platform game which has you in a castle consisting of several floors, each of which contain a variety of blocks. You control Mr. Do! the clown who has a hammer which can be used to knock out the blocks in the floor. Wandering throughout the castle are deadly unicorns which are constantly trying to catch you. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible and to progress through the increasingly difficult castles. 

There are two ways to complete a castle; you can either destroy all of the deadly unicorns by crushing them with blocks, or you can knock out all of the blocks which have a cherry symbol on them. In addition to the cherry blocks, there are three blocks with a key. If all three key blocks are knocked out, the door on the roof of the castle unlocks. If you make it to the door, all of the unicorns will temporarily become harmless and will contain a letter. If you hit a letter unicorn, you will earn a letter in the word EXTRA. Spell the complete word, and you will earn an extra life. 

The last type of block you'll encounter has a skull on it. If you knock out two skull blocks, all of the blocks between them will also be knocked out and replaced with a bridge. As the castles progress, the castle layout will become trickier and the unicorns become faster and more numerous.</desc>

		<name>Ms. Pac-Man</name>
		<desc>In 1982, a sequel to the  incredibly popular Pac-Man was introduced in the form of his girlfriend, Ms. Pac-Man.  This sequel continued on the "eat the dots/avoid the ghosts" gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.

Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics.  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.

Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of "Junior".</desc>

You control a diver at the bottom of the screen, and there is a giant octopus and killer shark you need to deal with. Each time an octopus tentacle touches the bottom of the screen, or the shark catches you some of your treasure will be lost. To deal with these creatures, your diver has a harpoon. You need to make sure that you shoot the shark before it can make it's way to the bottom of the screen and catch you (the shark will appear again at the top of the screen each time it is shot.) The octopus' tentacles will be reaching downward; each time a tentacle is shot it will retreat back to the top so you need to keep shooting the tentacles before one can reach the bottom. Of course, your diver has a limited air supply. Your companion is in a boat on the surface, and will occasionally drop an air line down. You need to catch this to replenish your air before it runs out (if you run out of air, some treasure will be lost). The game ends when you have lost all of your treasure.</desc>

You control Kung Fu Lu, whose mission is to destroy a mysterious, evil wall by reflecting a bouncing ball into the bricks that make up the wall. When the bricks are hit by the ball, they are destroyed. On the top of the screen is a mystical dragon which guards the wall. Each level can be completed by either destroying all of the bricks in the wall, or hitting the dragon six times with the ball. Once the first level is completed, a blackbird will also appear on screen just below the wall. The blackbird will deflect the ball, and tries to get in the way to make your mission more difficult. From time to time, a magic token will fall downward which gives you special powers if caught. These can make the ball magnetic and follow your player, give you a larger paddle, or make the ball explosive and take out larger chunks of bricks. You start the game at a skill level of Peasant, and advance in rank every time four waves of bricks are cleared. You lose a life every time the ball falls off the bottoms of the screen, and the game ends when you lose all five of your lives.</desc>

		<name>Out of Control</name>
		<desc>This is an obstacle race in a space ship. The ship controls in a rather Asteroids-like way, in that you push left or right to rotate and press fire to thrust. Once you stop thrusting, the ship does not immediately stop, although it will slow down on its own. To stop sooner, you have to face away from the direction you are traveling and thrust.

First, you must pass a set number of hurdles. If there is a single hurdle, you must pass on the side indicated by the arrow. If there are two hurdles, you must pass in between them. If there are three, you can pass through them or go around. If you hit a hurdle, you must go back to the last successfully passed hurdle and do it again to continue.

After the hurdles, you must pop ten space balloons by running in to them. They appear one at a time at random spots on the screen. After you pop all ten balloons, you must dock in the space dock to end the race.

The difficulty switches are not used. You select your game variation by moving the joystick up or down.

Game variations
There are 28 variations. The odd numbered ones have fast maneuvering, the even numbered ones, slow.

The number of hurdles also varies. The first two have 10 hurdles, the next two, 14, then 22 (twice), 27 (twice), 35 (twice), 39 (four times), 47 (twice), 51 (twice), 54 (twice), 63 (twice), 64 (twice), 72 (twice), and 82 (twice).</desc>

And lastly, there is the "getaway" option. With getaway, a player may move immediately after firing; without getaway, a player must remain stationary for as long as his bullet is on the screen.</desc>

		<name>Pac-Man 4K</name>
		<desc>The DEFINITIVE home version of the arcade classic!

Gobble your way through the maze of Pac-Land, chomping on dots and avoiding the four hungry monsters, Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde. But if you can manage to eat an energizer, turn the tables on those monsters by feasting on them for bonus points!

Dennis Debro sought to create an adaptation of Pac-Man more faithful than Atari's 1982 version for the VCS. Utilizing the same 4K memory limit as the original, Dennis' game is a feat of programming that finally brings Pac-Man to the Atari 2600 as it was intended.

Improvements over Atari's Pac-Man

Original, arcade maze layout
Proper "siren" sound that changes pitch
Monsters are proper colors
Maze is correct colors
Pac-Man and Ghost graphics much truer to arcade
Monster behavior modeled after arcade
Bonus items true to arcade
Feels like Pac-Man!</desc>

		<desc>This cartridge contains two games: Phantom II and Pirate.

Phantom II: Come fly the not-so-friendly skies.
Based on a 1979 Bally Midway coin-op game, you must fight your way through enemy planes to find and destroy the enemy bomber within the time limit. Do not ram the enemies as you only have one life. In the night time scenes, the enemy is only visible when the radar sweeps over them.

Pirate:
Can you find the treasure of the evil pirate "Up" Chuck LeDuc? Beware! His bony corpse wanders the island looking to protect it! Also watch out for snakes and the voodoo priestess!

Use your joystick to move about the island and use the button to fight, pick up an item, use an item and enter or exit the hut. You can carry nothing, a sword and/or a shovel but you must have the shovel when you reach the X that marks the treasure.</desc>

		<name>Phantom Tank</name>
		<desc>In Phantom-Panzer, the player takes control of an assault vehicle in order to defend their "energy base" at the bottom of the screen from the attacking phantom tanks.

The game consists of three phases: the first phase takes place in a city and looks like a maze. It offers relative protection with the building walls. The second phase has the enemy tanks crossing two bridges over a river, but there's practically no cover. In the third and final phase, it's an all-out battle with the phantom tanks aggressively charging in on the player's base and no obstacles to stop them.

The player can only shoot one bullet at a time and has to destroy 20 tanks in each stage. Enemy bullets can be canceled by hitting them with one's own bullet. The player loses one life if they collide with one of the tanks or the enemy bullets. The game is over immediately, however, if an enemy tank or shell hits the player's energy base.</desc>

		<name>Pick 'n' Pile</name>
		<desc>Pick 'n Pile is a Tetris-style puzzle game. On each level there are a variety of symbols arranged in columns on the screen. By moving the symbols around, you need to create columns which contain identical symbols; once all the symbols in a column are the same, that column disappears. Your goal is to earn points and complete the levels by making all of the symbols on the screen disappear. Occasionally, you may become stuck with a symbol that doesn't match anything onscreen; when this happens, you can call for an additional symbol to drop onto the screen. However, as the symbol which appears is random you may need to create quite a few symbols before the one you need appears. Each level has a time limit in which it needs to be completed; run out of time and you lose a life; lose all lives and the game is over.

In addition to the regular symbols, there are also some special objects on the screen which may help or hinder your progress. These include bombs which destroy several symbols at once, blocks which may get in the way or be arranged to help out, death heads which diminish time more quickly, and flower pots which can't be moved.</desc>

The different size cake layers come out of the oven randomly, so if you get a size you don't want it can be dropped off at the right side of the screen until a layer you do want appears. Although you can build cakes of different sizes, bonus points are earned for building a perfect cake consisting of one large layer, one medium layer, one small layer, and a cherry.

		<name>Pigs in Space : Starring Miss Piggy</name>
		<desc>Now it's time for...PIIIIIIGS IN SPAAAAACE!!!

This game is really three smaller games. You select what to play to choosing which character you want.
For Captain Link Hogthrob, it is Chickenvaders. A Pigs in Space take in Atari's Atari 2600 version of Space Invaders.
While exploring the planet Cluck, our intrepid hero was set upon by space chickens. Captain Link must destroy them before they make their way all the way to the planet. He does this by firing link sausages up at the chickens. But the chickens are not helpless. They are dropping space chicken eggs. If one hits Link, he will be turned into...a chicken! You also lose a life. From time to time, Gonzo flies across the screen top in his saucer. You can hit him for points also.

Scoring
Hitting a chicken on...
Row one=10 points
Row two=20 points
Row three=50 points
Row four=70 points
Row five=100 points
Hitting Gonzo=300 points
Destroying all the chickens=1000 point bonus

If you select First Mate Piggy, you play Pastaroids. Somehow, Piggy has been ejected from the Swinetrek into a pastaroid storm. You must guide Piggy from the bottom of the screen to the top and board the Swinetrek before it leaves. If you touch a flying meatball or spaghetti strand, you will lose ground, and thus time. You can press fire to give a meat ball a karate chop for points but don't dawdle.

Scoring
Karate-chopping a meat ball=100 points
Boarding the Swinetrek=1000 points

If you select Dr. Strangepork, you play Escape from Planet of the Gonzoids. The Swinetrek has gotten trapped in an abandoned pizza mine still being guarded by robotic Gonzoids, created by Gonzo. The Gonzoids are standing on ledges, throwing pizzas across the mine, You have a weapon called the Boomeray. When you fire, it goes up then curves to the side, hopefully landing on a Gonzoid. The direction it curves depends on which way you move before you fire. If you are hit by a pizza, hit the mine walls or are hit by your dropping Boomeray shot, you lose a life.

Scoring
You get one point for every mile you get through the mine.
Hitting a Gonzoid=100 points
Escaping the mine=1000 points

The difficulty switches do nothing. The only game selections are one player or two player, alternating.</desc>

Rolling logs and falling down a hole will deduct points, and scorpions, alligators, snakes, bottomless pits, swamps, and fires will cause Pitfall Harry to lose a life. You have 20 minutes to try to collect all of the treasures on the numerous screens, if you can live that long!</desc>

If you come to the landing strip, just align your ship with it to land and a refueling truck will top off your tanks. As you move into night, the enemy ships become too dark to see. You can then create light, temporarily, by firing off shots.</desc>

On the first screen, you must shoot swooping aliens while not getting shot by them. At some point, an alien will create a shield across the screen just above your ship that will require you to shoot holes through to destroy more aliens. Be aware, however, that the alien shots are not slowed at all and can still kill you.

On the second screen, you must shoot or avoid a phoenix(es) shots but the object is to shoot the alien in  the mothership above. You can also shoot the phoenix(es) themselves for points.

On the third screen, you must maneuver between parked ships, without hitting any, to dock at your spot at the top. Once you do this, the game goes to the first screen only harder.

There are game selections to choose to also play only the first, second or third screens, with each wave getting harder.</desc>

		<desc>In this remake of the arcade game Pooyan from the early '80s, you play the role of a pig, protecting its piglets from wolves.  

The first screen takes place near the pigs' home.  Mrs. Pig rides up and down in a cable car, shooting at wolves, who are riding balloons downward, towards the ground.  If the wolves land safely on the ground, then they can climb a ladder, near the cable-car, and catch Mrs. Pig.  But if she shoots their balloons, they splat on the ground instead.

The wolves shoot acorns at the pig.  But Mrs. Pig has a food based weapon too.  If she gets to the top, she can get meat, to toss at the wolves and make them jump off their balloons in pursuit.  Each wolf taken out this way is worth bonus points (on a doubling scheme: 400, 800 1600...)

The second scene takes place at the wolves lair.  Here the wolves have reinforced balloons--it takes multiple hits to make them fall.  Here they float upwards toward a big rock, which they push on top of Mrs. Pig, when seven wolves are present.  Additionally, an alpha wolf (wolf leader) appears and summons wolves in packs.</desc>

To do this, you will first need to find evidence against him and return the stolen property. During the game, you control Touche as he drive his car around the town looking for clues and the loot. As you drive around, various obstacles will be trying to stop you: questionable characters may appear and throw flower pots or daggers at you, pot holes may be found in the road, or assorted creatures may run in your path. From time to time, you will see questionable characters hiding in a window; if you jump up and catch them, you may find they are hiding an item you're looking for! If not, you will still get points for nabbing a questionable character and can move on to searching a new location. When you located an item, you need to find the proper building to return or verify the item after which you can move on to finding the next item. The game includes five different cases, each with a unique set of goals and of varying difficulty. Some of the goals you may need to complete are: find the stolen necklace and return it to the gem store, find the gun and verify it at the gun store, find the vase and return it to the museum, or find Le Fiend and book him at police headquarters. Each of the cases has a time limit; if you are unable to complete all of the tasks required by the case before time runs out, the game is over. Each case also takes place in a different part of the city, and the more difficult cases cover more city blocks so there will be a greater area to search!

Once again your goal is to change multicolored blocks to a target color, but now you must make sure all three visible sides of the blocks match the target color. You control Q*Bert on the playfield of blocks; Q*Bert changes the colors by jumping to a block which will cause it to rotate in the direction of his jump. Unlike the original game, you don't need to change the colors of the whole playfield, but rather need to form straight line(s) of the target colors, and when you do you can move on to the next round. Of course, to make this task more challenging are a variety of creatures (including a giant rat!) that chase you around the playfield. Each creature is a different color, and if it lands on a block where the top face is the same color then the creature falls off of the playfield, but if Q*Bert gets caught by a creature then a life is lost! As the game progresses, more creatures chase Q*Bert and additional colors are added to the playfield making it tougher to find the target color. There are no longer any discs on the sides of the playfield to carry you to safety, so make sure you don't jump off the edge! To help out, a green ball may appear from time to time; if you catch this, all the enemies become frozen temporarily.</desc>

The screen is broken up into four sectors (one on each edge of the screen), with the prison in the center. Your character is equipped with three phaser balls; on the screen you will see the captors running up and down vertically, and you need to hit them with a phaser ball.

The Runts will run back and forth horizontally, and you need to catch them before they run into the deadly wall at the edge of the screen. To make the game more challenging, you are only equipped with three phaser balls! This means after firing a phaser ball, you will need to quickly run around to the other side of the screen and catch it before it disappears. You will also lose a phaser ball if one of the captors collides with your character. Lose all three phaser balls, and the game is over. Also, there is a critter counter at the top of the screen; if you fail to destroy one of the captors or if one of the escaped Runts runs into a wall, the critter counter will decrease.

You begin your quest outside the temple; climb your way up the side of the temple in order to get inside. Poisonous snakes and deadly lightning bolts will block your progress here. Once inside the temple, you have a limited air supply so you need to explore quickly. Hidden in various rooms of the temple are numerous keys which are needed to unlock the vault. The keys and some other useful items are hidden in secret rooms which you need to locate by using your trusty pick axe or the flasks of acid you carry. To help figure out which rooms may contain hidden objects, you carry a geiger counter with you;  the higher the reading, the closer you are to something of interest! The rooms you'll be exploring are guarded by snakes, spiders, and even mummies! To deal with these enemies you carry a gun, and you can also use the acid flasks against them (ammo is limited, so use it wisely). If you are successful in your mission, you may receive a secret code which can be used to begin the game at later levels. Good luck!</desc>

Each time a critter jumps on a trampoline, the color will change to that critters color (green for the kangaroo, or blue for the squirrel).

Each level in the game gets progressively faster; at the end of a level, there will be a single column of fast moving trampolines to jump up, so be careful!</desc>

		<desc>You have been challenged, or maybe you challenged, someone to a game of racquetball.

To serve, press the red button. You hit the ball by moving your player to where the shadow of the ball is about level with your feet. The racquet will swing automatically. When you serve, the ball must hit the front wall before it hits the floor. Your opponent can then hit the ball before it lands on the floor or he can let it bounce but you can only let it bounce once. It cannot bounce twice. You serve every time until you miss. If you are serving and your opponent misses, you get one point. You can only get points on rounds where you serve. First player to twenty-one points, wins.

Difficulty switches
A=Shots accuracy is more difficult to control
B=Shot accuracy is easier to control.</desc>

		<desc>Raiders of the Lost Ark is an adventure game which is loosely based on the movie of the same name. In the game you control Indiana Jones on his quest to find the Lost Ark of the Covenant. The ark is hidden somewhere in the valley of poison. Your mission begins in the Egyptian city of Cairo; next you must find your way to the Temple of the Ancients where there is a secret map room. In the map room you will find a hieroglyphic indicating an object you must have to unlock the secrets of the map room; when unlocked, you will be able to find where in the Mesa Field the entrance to the Well of Souls is located. If you can find your way safely across the Mesa tops into the Well of Souls, you will locate the ark and win the game! The game uses two joysticks for control; one joystick moves Indy around the screen and uses a selected object, the second joystick allows you to select and/or drop objects from your inventory. On the many different locations of your journey you will come across different objects (some hidden) which can be collected to help you out. You may find weapons (like a whip or gun) for defense, or objects (such as a key or money) which can be used to unlock new areas or receive help. You begin the game with three lives, and the game ends when all lives are lost. There are plenty of enemies to hinder your progress, and of course numerous snakes!</desc>

		<name>Rainbow Invaders</name>
		<desc>It's the year 3006, and the evil Rainbow Invaders from the planet Pacco, are headed to Earth! They look like the ridiculous aliens depicted in 1980s arcade games, but are extremely dangerous and their goal is to exterminate all humans! You command a fleet of spaceships and you must defeat all of the Invaders to save Earth! Good luck!

This game is inspired by the game Space Invaders but with a twist. Yes, there are rows of invaders moving across the screen then moving down, firing as they go. Yes, your ship moves left and right at the bottom of the screen, firing up. Yes, an enemy ship will travel across the top of the screen. But there, the similarities end. For one thing, there are no shields to hide behind. Your ship does have a shield you activate by pulling back on the joystick but be warned, it drains all your energy so when you use it, after it is gone, you cannot move or fire for a second.

Also, the aliens are not dropping just electric shots. They also drop any of sixteen Special Shots. Some of these will help you, most will hinder you.

The Special Shots do the following:

1. Your ship's movements and shots become faster. Duration: ten seconds
2. Your ship's left/right movements are inverted. Duration: until you grab a different Special Shot or lose your current life.
3. Your ship's movements and shots become slower. Duration: until you grab a different Special Shot or lose your current life.
4. Enemies do not fire. Duration: ten seconds
5. Inavders' electric shots descend at maximum speed. Duration: until you grab a different Special Shot or lose your current life.
6. Invaders' electric shots track your ship. Duration: until you grab a different Special Shot or lose your current life.
7. Invaders stop moving. Duration: five seconds
8. Invaders move very fast. Duration: one second
9. All shots, your and the invaders, become invisible. Duration: ten seconds
10. If you shoot at an invader or the enemy ship and miss, a randomly generated invader could appear. And your Shoot Abort option, wherein when you shoot again the last shot disappears, is temporary disabled. Duration: thirty seconds
11. Your ship freezes. Duration: one second
12. Invaders electric shots follow a random path. Duration: until you grab a different Special Shot or lose your current life.
13. Your shots follow a random path. Duration: until you grab a different Special Shot or lose your current life.
14. Your shots dont stop when they hit an enemy but continue straight to the top of the screen, killing any enemies it hits. Duration: five seconds
15. A randomly chosen invader blinks. If you dont blast it immediately, every few moments a new invader is randomly generated. Duration: thirty seconds
16. A randomly chosen invader blinks. If you dont blast it before the bonus expires, your ship will explode. Duration: ten seconds. Meaning you have ten seconds to shoot that invader or lose a life</desc>

You, the Ramroid, are on a track in the center of the screen. You can aim left and right to fire. On both sides are colored bars that begin to randomly advance towards the center. You must shoot these bars to drive them back, preferably off the screen. If a bar starts flashing, it is a bonus bar and shooting it gets you larger points as well as clearing it from the screen completely. Be warned, though, that sometimes the bar will reappear on the opposite side of the screen.

A round ends when:
1. You have cleared all the colored bars from the screen or
2. The timer at the bottom, which starts at five thousand, reaches zero or
3. The colored bars have blocked off part of the screen and you clear the rods where you can

This sounds simple but you are timed. You can view the pattern you need by pressing fire but don't stay long as this makes the timer speed up to twice as fast while you are in that screen. In a two player game, the first player to find the correct pattern collects one point. The game ends when the timer runs out or, in two player, one player reaches nine points.

You start with ninety seconds. If you select the easy difficulty, the second puzzle with have five less seconds. Time decreases per screen until you reach twenty seconds, the lowest time. On the hard setting, you have to clear as many boards as you can in ninety seconds, total.</desc>

		<name>Reactor</name>
		<desc>Reactor is a conversion of the arcade game. You control a space ship inside a nuclear reactor which you are trying to stop from melting down! The reactor core at the center of the screen is surrounded by a deadly kill wall. Roaming throughout the available space are positrons, neutrinos, and photons, all of which will be trying to knock your ship into the wall. To survive you will need to knock all of these attacking particles into the kill wall to destroy them. As each level progresses, the reactor core will slowly grow in size, making less and less room to maneuver in. Eventually the reactor core will melt down; to prevent this, you need to destroy all of the particles before time runs out! To help out, you start the game with a limited number of decoys. When a decoy is placed on the screen, all of the particles will be attracted to it instead of your ship. If you place the decoy close enough to the kill wall, this will make it easier to destroy the particles. Also inside the reactor are two sets of control rods (located on the left and right sides of the screen); If you destroy an entire set of rods by knocking the particles into them, the reactor core will shrink down in size, giving you more time for your battle. If you destroy both sets of rods, you earn an extra decoy.</desc>

Space pirates are in the area and the robot interceptors are working against us. Your orders are to fly your F-117 Starwarrior to Terra I, destroying anything that tries to harm you.

You can move your ship up, down, left or right. You begin with a top-down view if the F-117, facing towards the bottom of the screen. Meteors and later space pirates come from the bottom moving up and you must shoot them. After you get through these, you switch to a side view of the ship and face left or right. Robot interceptors will come from the sides and must be destroyed then fish force fields (yes, fish force fields) will come from the top, moving down and you must shoot the fish-shaped devices to destroy them. They are Terra I's last defensive line so when you get through them, you win.

In the two player games, player one controls the F-117's left and right movement and player two controls the up and down movement therefore players must work together. Firing alternates between both players in two second intervals.</desc>

		<desc>You must build three walls above the tomato plants at the bottom. You must also dodge tomato bombs shot by the tomato plants, shoot tomato vines that grow on any part of the wall, shoot cherry tomatoes (or just dodge their shots) and shoot or dodge beefsteak tomatoes.

To capture a brick, you shoot it once. Then to place it, you shoot vertically at the wall once. You cannot place bricks horizontally.

The game's default is level setting six, which has all enemies and each round is harder than the last. The level settings are as follows:
Level one: Tomato plants only and every round is the same difficulty
Level two: Same as one but adds beefsteak tomatoes
Level three: Same as two but adds cherry tomatoes
Level four: Same as three but adds brick-growing vines
Level five: Same as three but each round gets harder than the last
Level six:  Same as four but each round gets harder than the last
Level seven: Same as five but the tomato bombs are wider
Level eight: Same as six but the tomato bombs are wider.

When the left difficulty switch is set to B, you have unlimited lives. If set to A, you have four lives.
The right difficulty switch affects the game speed; A faster, B slower.

The points are:
Killing the beefsteak tomato=5 points
Killing the cherry tomato=50 points
Shooting the brick-growing vine=5 points
Capturing a brick=10 points
Placing a brick in a wall=20 points
Completing the first wall=1,000 points
Completing the second wall=2,000 points

		<name>Riddle of the Sphinx</name>
		<desc>As the Pharoh's Son,  it is up to the player to lift the curse of Anubis, God of the Dead, by reaching the Temple of Ra, and solving the riddle of the Sphinx.

Armed with a sling and a pile of rocks, the Prince must navigate past thieves and scorpions on his journey.  He can trade with wandering nomads, dig for buried treasure, make offerings to the gods, or seek counsel and healing with Isis, the goddess of fertility and motherhood.

Great care must be exercised in his journey, for the Prince can weaken from thirst, which can be be replenished at an oasis or from certain treasures.  He will also sustain wounds from the hostile creatures of the land, including Anubis himself.

Once the Prince visits the various temples of the desert and makes his offerings, he must choose to make the correct offering (or offerings) to the Temple of Ra.  Choose wisely, and the Prince is rewarded.  Choose poorly, and the Prince loses inner strength points, and Egypt remains cursed.</desc>

		<name>River Raid II</name>
		<desc>You're the pilot of an F-14 assault jet, assigned to the dangerous mission of taking out an enemy bridge at the top of a heavily guarded river. In River Raid II, the gameplay is similar to the original River Raid, but with a few additions. For each mission you start out on an aircraft carrier. After a successful takeoff, you need to get past enemy forces located over the ocean which guard the entrance to the river. Make sure to collect plenty of fuel from the refueling jets, since once you reach the river fuel will become scarce! Next you will have to make your way up the treacherous river channel until you finally reach, and hopefully destroy, the bridge. But the level isn't over yet, for now  you have to return to the aircraft carrier and land safely. After completing all of this, you move on to the next, more challenging level. In addition to the expanded levels, another change in River Raid II is the ability to control the altitude of your plane. You can fly high above everything, or fly low into the channel to take out enemy tanks and barges.</desc>

		<desc>River Raid is a vertically scrolling action game. You fly a jet up a river in an attempt to destroy bridges which are vital to the enemy. The river is heavily guarded, however, with balloons, ships, choppers, and enemy aircraft trying to stop you. Along the way you will need to fly over fuel stations to refuel your jet and keep flying.

The plane is armed with a cannon with unlimited ammo. It can be used to destroy the enemy vehicles and bridges, but a careless player can accidentally destroy a fuel station. Colliding with the riverbanks or with the enemy aircraft destroys your plane and makes you lose a life.</desc>

		<desc>This game is based on an arcade game that was released by Atari.

You play the Road Runner. You must run along the road, avoiding trucks, landmines, falling rocks, etc. and also not get caught by Wile E. Coyote. You must also eat birdseed along the way or you will become faint and Wile E. will catch you.

You can get points for eating birdseed and making Wile E. get hit by trucks, falling rocks, etc.

The Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum versions are one player only. The Atari 2600 version is one or two player, alternating. The Atari 2600 version also has another difference in that you don't HAVE to eat the birdseed but you can for the points. This may have been due to programming constraints on the Atari 2600.</desc>

		<desc>Robin Hood is an action game where you need to rescue Maid Marian who is being held by the Sheriff of Nottingham in a castle (and while you're at it, steal some gold to give to the poor)! Gameplay takes place on several different screens which have different objectives. First you will need to make your way through Sherwood Forest; numerous henchman are hiding here, so use your arrows to shoot them. Surviving the forest, the next section takes place outside of the castle; naturally, numerous henchman guard the castle gate. While dodging incoming arrows, you need to shoot enough of the henchman to cause the gate to open. Once it opens, you can enter the castle for the final scene. Inside the castle you will be able to find Maid Marian behind one of the many doors, and gold behind another. The rest of the doors have henchman hiding behind them, but if you can find the Maid Marian or the gold then you win this round and the game repeats at a tougher skill level.</desc>

		<desc>There are numerous enemy tanks crossing the countryside, destroying everything in their path! Your job is to command a robot tank to stop them. Robot Tank is a first person perspective arcade style action game. There are twelve squadrons of tanks to destroy, each containing twelve tanks. Each time you destroy a complete squadron, you earn an extra reserve tank before moving on to the next, more difficult squadron. The game takes place twenty four hours a day; gameplay will alternate from early morning to mid afternoon to late at night. In addition to the constantly changing time of day, the weather can also change unexpectedly. Snow, rain, and fog will appear occasionally making it tougher to spot your targets. Luckily your tank is equipped with radar to help locate the enemy when visibility is poor. As your tank takes damage you will lose some capabilites, such as speed, the radar, or your canons. If your tank takes too much damage, it will be destroyed; the game ends when all of your reserve tanks are gone.</desc>

		<name>Roc 'n Rope</name>
		<desc>Your player is a mountain climber who must avoid cavemen, dinosaurs and pterodactyls as he climbs up the cliff-sides. Your goal in each level is to climb up and reach a mystical bird with great plumage, while staying one step above the bonus timer which determines how long you may stay on each level. The mountain climber has only one ability; to shoot rope at 45 degree angles which he may then climb up to other platforms. His other action is a stun beam which will allow him to walk past enemies who get too close; but will only work horizontally from him. As for power-ups, on each level is (usually 2) a flashing diamond power-up which will make him invincible and allow him to defeat monsters. Also as a power-up are glowing treasures of some kind which are worth extra points. 

Your player also cannot take a fall, except for extremely small ones unless he is able to climb down vines. This means that when you shoot your rope and are climbing it, you are vulnerable. Even more so because enemies are allowed to "shake" the rope until you fall off if they reach the base of the rope. Pterodactyls fly overhead and drop eggs on the player.

There are 4 distinct levels; the cliff-side, the windmill, the waterfall and the peak. Completing all of these levels will restart the game with faster enemies and power-ups located in different places.</desc>

You race along a five-lane freeway, in control of a car equipped with weapons, on a mission to destroy certain carrier cars which are causing traffic jams.  You must weave in and out of traffic at high speeds blasting slow-moving cars in your path to reach your destination.  Along the way, you must also avoid obstacles such as destroyed cars, barricades, nails, and  oil slicks on the road.  A radar tracks the enemy and warns of coming danger.

Collisions with other vehicles and objects will damage your car and cause malfunction.  The car will repair itself slowly as time lapses, or you may pull over for a quick repair, but you may let your target escape if you take too long.  You only have one car, and the game is over when this car is lost.</desc>

		<name>Shuttle Orbiter</name>
		<desc>You must get ten parts from an orbiting factory to an incomplete space station. Unfortunately, a comet passed near Earth and left a space debris field that you will need to avoid.

After the launch, you will see the Earth being circled but four colored dots. At the bottom will be the elapsed time, remaining fuel and four indicator bars. These bars are your orbit altitudes and their colors correspond to the colors of the orbiting dots: white for the shuttle, gold for the station, red for the orbiting factory, and green for the fuel depot.

When you are lower in orbit than an item, you move faster. If you are higher than an item, you move slower. You must match orbit and location with something to dock. Once you are close to something, you switch to the maneuvering display. Now you can interact with an item or avoid it, as in the debris. If you hit something, whether debris or man-made orbiting item, you begin to leak fuel. This means you will use fuel even if you are not firing thrusters. You also have a 25% chance to damage the part in the cargo hold.

Game variations
The difficulty switches and select switch are not used. After you press fire on the joystick, move the stick up or down to select the difficulty level, from 0 to 3. Game 0 has no space debris.

There is no score, just the amount of time it takes you and whether or not you got all ten parts in place without running out of fuel.</desc>

		<path>./Sinistar (USA) (Proto).zip</path>
		<name>Sinistar</name>
		<desc>An unreleased prototype of the classic arcade title.

The player pilots a lone spacecraft, and must create "Sinibombs" by shooting at drifting planetoids and catching the crystals that are thereby released. Sinibombs are needed to defeat the game boss, Sinistar, an animated spacecraft with a demonic skull face. Sinistar does not exist at the start of the game, and is continuously under construction by enemy worker ships. Though time is crucial, attempting to mine too quickly will destroy a planetoid without releasing any crystals. At the same time, enemy worker ships are also gathering crystals (often stealing them from the player) which they use to construct the Sinistar. Meanwhile, enemy warrior ships can also directly attack the player's ship. The player is given a head-start before the enemy ships have enough crystals to begin construction. Game ends when the player's ships are all destroyed.</desc>

		<desc>A damsel in distress is being held in a castle by a fire breathing dragon! As Sir Lancelot, you need to ride your winged horse Pegasus to the rescue. Each level in this action game consists of two screens. First you are outside the castle which is guarded by numerous flying creatures. You need to fly around the screen and destroy all of the creatures by hitting them with your lance (careful, if they hit you instead you'll lose a life). After all of the creatures are gone, you enter the second screen which is inside the castle. Here there is a large pit of lava and a flying dragon. To destroy the dragon you need to hit it's stomach with your lance. If you are hit by one of the dragon's fireballs you'll be temporarily stunned and unable to fly. If you end up falling into the lava, you'll lose a life. If you can defeat the dragon, the game repeats at a higher difficulty level. The game ends when you lose all of your lives.</desc>

		<desc>In this game, you have five minutes to get from your front steps to the steps of the school. You have to get through this maze and conquer 30 tubes and ramps AND get to the school.

You start at your front steps. To get on the board, move left or right and while moving, press fire. When you are on your board, just push the direction you want to turn. Press fire to jump and press and hold fire to jump and land in a crouched position. You will also see rails, walls and hurdles but these you must avoid as they will make you crash.

To jump a ramp, just ride towards it and be aligned with it. To clear a tube, ride through it while crouched. If you ride through grass, it will slow you down. To get back up to speed, either crash into something or ride through grass until you stop then get the skateboard going again.

The scoreboard at the top of the screen is not an obstacle. When you get to it, you just keep going.</desc>

The longer you wait to open your parachute, the more points you earn for a successful landing, but don't wait too long or your chute won't open at all! For each jump, there will be varying wind conditions which blow your sky diver off course. A wind sock at the bottom of the screen will help you determine the wind speed and direction so you can compensate. There are nine jumps total, and the player with the most points at the end wins.</desc>

If you fly to the wrong side of a pylon, you will get a three second penalty for each missed pylon. The total number of pylons remaining is at the top of the screen above the time. If you hit a tree, pylon or balloon your plane will crash to the ground. You will not die but this will hurt your time as your plane has to take off again. Hitting a pylon will not hurt your pylon count. You will still get credit for the pylon but will lose time as your plane was slowed. You can press the fire button to throttle up or release to throttle down. Move the joystick left or right to turn. You bank into turns so you need to time turns as it is not instant. Up and down on the joystick do nothing.</desc>

		<desc>You pilot a plane and must rescue animals from cages where they were placed by gorillas. To do this, you fly over a gorilla and drop a bomb, knocking the gorilla off its feet. Once this is done, the animals will be out of their cages and you just touch each one to rescue it. The animal cages will only be open for a limited time, then the gorilla will get back on its feet. You must then knock it down again.

You mustn't take too long rescuing the animals or you will run out of fuel. If you run out of fuel, run into a gorilla or the course walls or, strangely, a cloud, you lose a plane. You begin the game with four planes.

Difficulty switches
Set to A for faster plane, set to B for slower plane.

Game variations
Game 1...Tricky flying course
Game 2...Tricky flying course and clouds
Game 3...Tricky flying course, clouds and faster plane.

Scoring
Knock a gorilla of its feet=10 points
Rescue any one animal=100 points
Rescue one of each of the four types of animals, consecutively (1 cat, 1 turtle, 1 rabbit, 1 duck)=500 points

You get an extra plane every 10,000 points.</desc>

Each side-scrolling screen presents various obstacles that the player must precisely jump over (e.g. fences, stalagmites) or land upon (e.g. ledges). Failure to execute any jump results in instant death. Higher difficulty levels introduce flying bats and spiders that the player must also avoid.
The ColecoVision version of Smurf: Rescue in Gargamel's Castle contains an Easter egg. Upon reaching Smurfette's screen, the player can return to the previous screen. Just before the screen changes, it will appear as though the top of Smurfette's dress comes off, making her appear topless.</desc>

With Harmony Smurf, the computer will play four, five or six notes and you must repeat them. After the notes play, they fall to the ground and you must put them in their correct spots. The highest level has invisible notes, you must match by sound only.

There are two modes, changed by the select switch.
In Game Mode, the computer plays and you must duplicate it. In Toy Mode, there are six notes on the ground and you can make any tune you like, the computer doesn't create a tune.

With Handy Smurf, items will move along a conveyor belt and you must sort them into one of three bins. You press the button to close or open gaps to guide the object but don't press too soon or the gap returns to the way it was before after a short time.

In Game Mode, the first five items are sorted by shape, the next five by size and the next five by color then the sequence repeats only faster. In Toy Mode, after each item is sorted, the sorting criteria (shape, size or color) changes randomly.

With Greedy Smurf, Clumsy Smurf has a colored liquid in a glass. Using blue, red, yellow and white spigots, Greedy must put the same color liquid or mix liquids to get the same color in his glass. If he gets it right, he and Clumsy drink up. If he gets it wrong, the glass drains out.

In Game Mode, the colors start easy and get progressively harder. In Toy Mode, the color selection in Clumsy's glass is random.

There is no time limit or penalty if you get something wrong.</desc>

The game is played by two players (or one player against the computer); one player will close his eyes while the other player hides somewhere. After the second player is hidden, the first player needs to locate him in the shortest time possible. After the second player has been located, the roles will then be reversed. The game takes place in an old house with three rooms available as well as the front yard to hide in; each of these four locations contains five different places to hide. The game can be played with fixed or variable hiding locations; in the fixed game, the hiding locations will always be found in the same place, and the variable game will move the hiding places around each time a room is entered. Two difficulty levels are available; in the tougher setting, the entrance to the hiding places is narrower making it tougher to find.</desc>

		<desc>In Solar Fox, your mission is to guide a space ship though a solar cell matrix and collect as many of the solar cells as you can. When all of the cells in a matrix have been collected, you move on to the next round. Each matrix is guarded by two sentinels trying to stop you. The sentinels wander around the perimeter of the matrix, and will shoot fireballs at your spaceship which can destroy it. You are unarmed, so your only defense against the fireballs is to avoid them. To help you out a bit, your ship is capable of flying at two different speeds. Each round begins with a 'skip-a-rack' timer; if you collect all solar cells before this timer runs out, you will earn bonus points and skip ahead a level. The game ends when you have lost all of your space ships.</desc>

		<desc>Solar Storm is an arcade style action game where you control a spaceship to defend your home planet. Deadly Deltoid ships will be flying in trying to destroy your planet; in addition to this danger, a far off sun has exploded sending debris towards you. Your job is to shoot everything that is heading your way before it reaches your planet (the bottom of the screen). Each time an enemy ship or some debris makes it past you, your planets shield absorbs the energy and heats up; if it overheats, it will be destroyed and the game ends. If your laser ship crashes into any incoming danger, you lose a life (the game also ends if all lives are lost). Every 500 points there is a bonus screen where you have a chance to earn more lives. The longer you last, the faster the game will become.</desc>

		<name>Space Shuttle : A Journey into Space</name>
		<desc>Space Shuttle is a simulation game where you are the pilot of space shuttle Discovery. Your goal is to launch the Discovery, establish an orbit around the Earth, open the cargo bay doors and recover a satellite to perform repairs, and finally land the Discovery successfully, all while using as little fuel as possible. Each time the complete mission is accomplished, it will then repeat at a higher difficulty level (in the higher difficulty levels the satellite has a more erratic flight path). The game is played from a first person perspective in the space shuttle cockpit where you can control everything from the shuttles engines to cargo bay doors. When the game is over you will be given a ranking which is based on the number of successful dockings and the amount of fuel that was used. In addition to the full flight mode, two easier game variations (autosimulator and simulator mode) are included. The autosimulator mode is the easiest; the computer will control the flight (you can take over at any point you wish) and the controls are simplified. The simulation mode is closer to the full game, however you have an unlimited amount of fuel so there is no time pressure, and the computer will help compensate for inaccurate maneuvering.</desc>

		<name>SpaceMaster X-7</name>
		<desc>You are an assault ship that was designed to destroy Hyperion military bases.

You must shoot the bases enough so that the energy meter at the bottom goes from the "+" to the "-". Once the meter gets to "-" the base will explode.

Obviously, the base is not a sitting duck. There is a force field that expands and contracts, base defenders and , in higher rounds, shields. The force field has a gap in it that you can shoot through or you can maneuver inside the field and shoot the base up close. Be careful, though, because you can get caught within the field.

If you touch a shield, the force field, the base or are touched by a defender, you lose a life.

The defenders are fireballs, heat seekers, bouncers, wanderers, and homers.

The scoring is as follows:
Destroy a fireball = 25 Points
Destroy a heat seeker = 100 Points
Destroy a bouncer = 50 Points
Destroy a wanderer = 200 Points
Destroy a homer = 400 Points

You also get 25 points for each hit you get on the base.

When you destroy the first four bases, you get 1,000 points per base; the next four, 2,000 points per base and so on.

You get a bonus ship after every second base you destroy and after every 10,000 points.</desc>

		<desc>Spike's Peak is an action game where you need to climb to the top of a mountain! Gameplay takes place on five different screens. The first screen shows you approaching the mountain; you begin here each time you start a game or lose a life. All you need to do is walk up the path to begin the stage you've reached so far. Flags by the path indicate how many lives you have left. The next screen is a zig zag path through meadows at the base of the mountain. Beware of the deadly bears and eagles here! Along the path are several caves which you can hide in when a bear or eagle appears (you can also jump over bears). The caves are cold, however, and you have a limited amount of time to hide before freezing to death. Make it to the top of the path, and you begin the next screen. Here you climb up a rocky ledge. Boulders and falling pieces of rock constantly appear and can knock you back down the screen. Next is the icy cap of the mountain. Climb up to the top without being knocked down by avalanches or getting caught by the abominable snowman. The last screen takes place at the mountain summit where you need to climb to the top and plant a flag before freezing! Complete all of these screens and you win the game. There are four different difficulty levels available.</desc>

		<name>Spy Hunter</name>
		<desc>A conversion of the arcade game, Spy Hunter is a driving action game played from an overhead point of view. Your car is equipped with machine guns to help you get past the numerous enemies out on the road (be careful not to shoot any civilians, though!) Occasionally you will come across a weapons van, and if you drive into the back of the van your car becomes equipped with a second weapon (such as smoke screen, oil slick, or missiles.) At several points the road splits and you can enter a boathouse which transforms your car into a boat temporarily. If you drive far enough the seasons change as well (watch out for icy conditions during winter!) The enemy cars will do anything to stop you, including running you off the road, firing guns from the back of a limmo, or dropping bombs from a helicopter.</desc>

		<desc>In Squeeze Box your goal is to escape from prison! To escape, you will need to blast your way through the wall on either the left or right side of the screen. Once a hole large enough to walk through is formed, you can use it to escape to the next screen. To make the game more difficult, the walls are constantly growing, and if you touch a wall you will lose a life! A second game variation is included where one wall is stationary, and the second wall grows. Your goal is to shoot all of the moving multi-colored wall blocks to turn them white. A row of blocks turns white when they all of have been destroyed; the row will then begin growing again, but you will now longer be able to shoot the blocks! When all of the rows have been changed to white, you will move on to the next level. The third (and final) game variation included is similar to the second one, except that the wall behind you will also move inwards; Your goal is still to shoot your way through the left wall before the right wall catches up to you. Each variation has two difficulty levels, the tougher difficulty has twice as many blocks as the easier.</desc>

		<name>Sssnake</name>
		<desc>You were hunting in the Amazon when you become the hunted of prehistoric creatures. You found a fortress with a large gun. Now you must avoid the snakes that enter and exit and shoot the creatures through the holes in the fortress bricks.

The snakes will slither from one side on the screen to the other then come the opposite way one level lower. You cannot kill the snake but you can shorten it when you shoot it. Your gun runs on a gun track inside the fortress walls and always shoots away from the fortress. You cannot shoot through the bricks themselves, only in between them.

Game variations
In game one, the snakes enter the screen from one side but move fast. In game two, they enter from any side but move slower. Either way, you only have one life. Player two begins after player one by just pressing the button on the right joystick. If there is no player two or after player two dies, then you must press reset to play again.

Scoring
You score one point for shooting a prehistoric creature.
You gain no points for shooting at the bricks or shooting the snake.</desc>

		<desc>This is a conversion of a 1980 Exidy coin-op game.

It is a time of crisis for the Earth forces. Years of constant assault
from the EXIDY coalition have left Earth almost totally defenseless.

Intergalactic intelligence has discovered a new threat, several Exidy
freighters, protected by an armada of smaller vessels, have entered a
friendly sector of space and are advancing on Earth itself, loaded with
enough weaponry to completely annihilate the planet.

You are Earth's only hope.

Aim your cross hair onto an enemy ship and press the button to fire. Try to shoot as many enemies as you can. Once you destroy all the enemies in a sector, a warp gate appears. Shoot it to warp to the next sector. Whenever your ship gets a direct hit from enemy fire, your shield loses energy. To restore shield energy look out for, and shoot, energy diamonds.</desc>

Of course, your mission won't be easy; guarding the planet are numerous enemy fighters. To protect yourself from enemy attacks your ship is equipped with lasers. The game ends when all of your ships have been destroyed. Good luck!</desc>

		<name>Star Raiders</name>
		<desc>As the pilot of an interstellar starship, your mission is to destroy all of the Krylon fighters which are closing in on your starbases! There are three different types of fighters roaming throughout the galaxy; cruisers, fighters, and basestars. With the help of your galactic map, you can find the sectors of the galaxy where these fighters are located and then warp there to destroy them. When all of the fighters in a sector are destroyed, you can warp to a new location for the next battle. Be sure to keep an eye on your starships energy; warping to new locations, being hit by enemy fire, or colliding with an asteroid will drain your energy. If you completely run out of energy, your starship will be destroyed, however you can warp back to a starbase to refuel at any time. Returning to a starbase will also repair other types of damage your starship can receive, such as faulty engines, loss of your shield, and faulty photon torpedoes. When all of the Krylon that are visible on your galactic map have been destroyed, you win this round and can advance in rank (or even be demoted if you performed poorly on a mission).  The games difficulty will gradually increase as you rise in rank from ships cook up to captain.</desc>

		<name>Star Ship : Outer Space</name>
		<desc>Star Ship contains three different arcade action games which can be played by one or two players.

Star Ship
These game variations are played from a first person point of view in your star ship. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by shooting the various enemies and space debris. You have a time limit of 2 minutes 16 seconds in the one player versions. In the two player version the time limit is 4 minutes 32 seconds; for half of this time one player will be the star ship commander, and the other will control a space module and needs to dodge the star ships fire. The roles will be reversed for the second half of the time limit.

Warp Drive
These game variations are also played from a first person point of view. Your goal here is to travel as much distance as possible while avoiding the oncoming asteroids.

Lunar Lander
These game variations are played from a third person point of view. You need to pilot your star ship and successfully land on the constantly moving moon. One point is earned for each successful landing, and asteroids and other debris may get in your way and will deduct points if you crash. In the two player versions, one player controls the star ship and the other player controls the moon.

Each of these games feature several variations which control the game speed and level of difficulty.</desc>

Before you get a chance at destroying NOMAD, you'll have to battle your way through ten levels (each consisting of multiple rounds). In each round you may encounter Klingon fighters, deadly anti-matter saucers, asteroid fields, and deadly meteors, all of which are capable of depleting the Enterprises energy. The game ends when your energy supply has completely run out. To fight these dangers, the Enterprise is equipped with an unlimited supply of phasers and a limited supply of photon torpedoes. Each round also contains one or more starbases; if you dock at a starbase, some of your supplies (such as energy and torpedoes) will be replenished. The game is played from two points of view; the top of the screen contains a third person view of the Enterprise (along with the ships gauges), and on the bottom of the screen is a first person point of view</desc>

		<desc>Star Voyager is an action game similar to Star Raiders. You control the space ship Star Voyager from a first person perspective; your objective is to make your way through seven star portals to save the Capital Starport, destroying enemy ships along the way. On each level there will be multiple enemies to destroy; typically they appear first in the distance, then close in slowly while firing torpedoes at you. Using the Star Voyagers weapons (either lasers or photon torpedoes) you need to destroy the enemies before they destroy you. Once a star portal appears, you need to navigate your way through to reach the next level (don't crash into the portal walls, you'll be destroyed!). In addition to the main viewport, the bottom of the screen also contains a status bar which shows the number of enemies destroyed, your energy level, and a scanner to help locate enemies.

Two player game variations are also included; in these one player controls Star Voyager, and the other player can choose to either control Star Voyagers weapons or the enemy ships.</desc>

You start the task outside the shield perimeter of the Death Star. There you'll have to combat different imperial vessels and avoid the death ray while waiting for an opportunity to slip through one of the random openings in the energy shield. After reaching the Death Star you must reduce its structure up to the point where you can hit the core. In the following blow up of the station you must avoid collision with Death Star debris.

After successful destruction the game will restart with increased difficulty (faster enemies, faster Death Star build up, etc).

Overall difficulty can also be adjusted before starting the game.</desc>

Entering this Stargate not only warps you to the nearest humanoid in jeopardy, but can also warp you ahead (while on the first 15 levels) if you enter it with 4 or more humanoids, and give you extra lives if you warp with 10 humanoids, so there is a trade-off between guaranteeing the safety of existing humanoids, and trying to advance your position

There are more enemies on screen than ever before. The Inviso button makes you invisible to enemies, but also to yourself, so you will have to follow your bullets to work out where on the screen you are.</desc>

		<desc>A cockpit view space shooter very similar to Star Raiders but not requiring a keypad. In your starship, you must warp to sectors of space containing enemy starships. Here you will engage and destroy them before they can surround and destroy your starbases.   In a starbase sector, use your joystick to guide your reticle to the starbase when it is near you for repair and/or refueling. In a fight, you can take damage. If you see a L, it meas your lasers are out of commission. This mean you cannot fire (this is not good in a fight!). If you see a W, it means your warp drive is damaged. You will use twice as much fuel when warping. If you see an S, it means your shields are out. If you are hit again with no shields, you will be destroyed. If you see an R, it means your radar is damaged. You will not be able to see the enemies on the starmap until you get the radar fixed. All your starbases will still show with damaged radar except any that have been destroyed. When warping, if the screen at the bottom is green, you are headed to an empty sector. If it is red, you are headed to a sector with enemies in it. If it is blue, you are headed to a sector with a starbase in it. The game ends when either all the enemies are destroyed or you are destroyed. Your final score is determined by your base score plus 100 points per enemy destroyed minus 500 points per starbase destroyed minus 100 points per each time you docked at a starbase minus 1 point per stardate.</desc>

		<name>Steeplechase</name>
		<desc>This is a hurdles horse race.

The horse's names, from bottom to top, are: Lucky Devil, Absent Mind, Just Missed and Little Dictator. You play as one of the jockeys and must reach the right side of the screen first. The horse runs and hurdles come at you from the right. To jump these hurdles, you turn the paddle to set the height of the jump, as indicated by the marker on the right. You press the button to jump. The better you jump, the faster your horse goes. After 3 minutes, if no one has gotten all the way to the right, the race ends and whoever was in the lead wins.

There are 6 game variations. In games 1, 2 and 3, the distance between the hurdles is uniform with the computer-controlled horse's racing ability being poor, good and excellent, respectively.
In games 4, 5 and 6, the the distance between the hurdles is random with the computer-controlled horse's racing ability being poor, good and excellent, respectively.
The difficulty switches are not used.</desc>

		<path>./Stellar Track (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Stellar Track</name>
		<desc>This is an Atari 2600 version of a Star Trek game found on many college mainframes.

Like those mainframe programs, it has no graphics, only text. You use the joystick, moving left or right, to select the command you want then press the red button. You then move the joystick left or right to select set the parameters of that command, if there are any. You start by pressing Reset or Select to choose how many enemies you must kill in how many stardates. 

The commands and any settings are as follows:

Galaxy Map=a 6x6 grid that starts out empty until you do a long range scan. Afterwards, the quadrants will show a 2 digit number. The left digit is the number of aliens in the area. The right digit will either be a 1 or a zero, depending on whether there is or is not a starbase in that area. Galaxy map costs you no energy or stardates.

LR Scan=Long range scan. This will tell you what is in your quadrant and all the quadrants next to yours. If there are any enemies in your quadrant when you do an LR scan, they will attack you. LR scan does not cost energy or stardates but it does take a turn.

SR Scan=Short range scan. This shows you the stars, aliens and starbases in your quadrant. You need to do this to destroy aliens and dock with starbases. Like LR Scan, if there are aliens in your quadrant, they will attack after you use SR Scan. Also, like LR Scan, SR Scan does not cost energy or stardates but it does take a turn.

Warp=Warp is how you move, either from quadrant to quadrant or from sector to sector within a quadrant. You move by setting 2 settings. The first is your direction. You select a direction based on the numbers below:
8  1  2
  | /
7--*--3
 / | 
6  5  4
Next, you select how many quadrants and sectors to move. If you want to move within a quadrant, set the left number to zero so you don't warp out of that quadrant. Warp uses stardates, energy and a turn. If you warp into a quadrant that has only you and stars, the screen will be green. If you warp into a quadrant with aliens or aliens and a starbase, the screen will be red. If you warp into a quadrant with just the starbase, the screen will be gray. You cannot warp through stars. If you try, you lose the stardate and energy but don't go anywhere.

Photon Torpedo=If you hit an enemy with one of these, just one shot kills them. You select the direction with the same numbers as warp. there must be a clear line of sight between you and the enemy; no stars. You carry up to 9 torpedoes and they can be replenished.  Photon torpedoes do not cost energy or time, just a turn.

Phasers=Unlike photon torpedoes, you do not need to be directly in line of the enemy or tell the game where to fire. You just set how strong you want the blast to be, via a three digit number, and the computer fires. The closer you are to the enemy, the harder you hit. Phasers use the amount of energy from you as you fired. You also use a turn.

Status=A status report. This will tell you how many stardates, aliens, energy units and photon torpedoes are left and whether you have taken damage and to what. If you have taken damage, you will see a negative number next to the damaged item. This is how many stardates it will take to repair the item on your own. You cannot leave the quadrant if your engines are damaged. Instead, you must try to warp the number of quadrants that would take that much time. You won't go anywhere but you will repair.

If you dock at a starbase, you are instantly repaired of all damage, refueled and torpedoes are restocked. Starbases are placed randomly in the galaxy and never move or get destroyed. There are always two per galaxy. To dock, warp to the quadrant and sector where the base is, so you over the top of it.

Skill (Difficulty) switches
The right switch controls how easily you take damage. In the Expert (A) position, your chance of taking damage is twice as likely as in the Novice (B) position.
The left switch controls phaser strength. In the Novice (B) position, your phasers are twice as strong as the aliens'. In the Expert (A) position, your phasers are the same strength as the aliens'.</desc>

		<name>Strat O Gems Deluxe</name>
		<desc>Strat O Gems Deluxe is a falling jewels game similar to Columns, Acid Drop, Jewel Master, Paris Hilton's Diamond Quest, among others.

Three colored gems fall from the top of the screen in a vertical pattern. You must place the gems on the growing pile so that there are three or more of the same color in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally. When you get three or more of the same color in a row, they will disappear from the screen. If you get a combo of three or more levels, you get a high bonus. A combo is when gems disappear and cause more gems to line up and disappear. Occasionally, three gems that change colors and have colored horizontal bars across them will appear. These will create a row with whatever gems you place them on. At the end of the level, a flashing white gem with a horizontal white bar will drop down. This will remove whatever color gem it is placed on, regardless of where they are on the screen. If the gems pile up to the line at the top of the screen, the game is over.</desc>

When the game begins, a mixed up character will appear on the screen and you need to change the head, body, and legs until they are all from a single character. If a complete character is correctly formed, the character will perform a dance and you will hear their musical theme; if an incomplete character is formed, the musical theme heard will be partially from each of the characters you did create. Several levels of difficulty are included which dictate the time limit and which character needs to be created. In the easier levels, the character you must create will be indicated by text at the bottom of the screen. In the more difficult levels, you must create a character based on the theme song that plays.</desc>

		<name>Stronghold</name>
		<desc>You are sent to check out an abandoned asteroid base called Stronghold. As you approach, drones are launched from the surface. It may be abandoned but apparently the automatic defense system still works.

You must shoot or avoid the drones. If the drones are cloned, and traveling in sets, shooting any drone in the set destroys all the ones in the set, if they are destroyable (see Game variations). You can move in any direction but cannot shoot straight left or right. You can shoot in any other direction, however. After you get past the drones, three shields form near the bottom of the screen. Also, interceptor and patrol ships appear. The interceptors track you and the patrol ships just move back and forth over the shields.

You must shoot through the shields while dodging these ships so you can shoot the command crawler on the asteroid's surface. Be warned, though, that once there is a hole in the shield, the command crawler will shoot through it to destroy you. The crawler tries to stay below you but it is slow. In some game variations, the Mega-Field starts to form at the top of the screen, reducing your maneuvering room(see Game variations).

Difficulty switches
The difficulty switches determine what level you will start on.
Both are set to B=start at level 1
Left is set to A and right is set to B=start at level 9
Left is set to B and right is set to A=start at level 17
Both set to A=start at level 25

Controlling your cave ranger, you need to blast the various types of aerobots which are guarding the cave. When all of the bots on a cave level have been destroyed, a passageway opens allowing you to travel deeper into the caverns. When you reach the last level of the cavern, you can collect the treasure crystal and be transported to the next (more challenging) set of caves and try for another crystal. In addition to the deadly aerobots, be sure not to crash into cave walls; these will drain your energy rapidly, especially if you hit one of the skulls. When all of your reserve cave rangers have crashed, the game is over. As you progress through the caves, they become narrower and the enemies move faster. Standard and advanced skill levels are available.</desc>

		<desc>Super Breakout features similar gameplay to the original, but with several new game variations. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by destroying the bricks at the top of the playfield. To do this, you need to use the paddle at the bottom of the screen to keep a bouncing ball within the playfield. There are four different game variations included. The first is 'Breakout', and plays the same as the original game. 

This leaves three new gameplay concepts. In 'Progressive' the brick walls will slowly drop towards the bottom of the screen and the ball moves progressively faster and faster. When there's room, a new layer of bricks will appear at the top. 

The other two games add a second paddle. In 'Double Breakout' you have two balls to keep in play and score with. In 'Cavity' there is a single ball in play when you start, but two additional balls trapped within the bricks. These are freed when their surrounding bricks are destroyed.</desc>

Once the player reaches the top of the board, a new and more difficult round starts. Scoring is achieved by staying on top of the wave as long as possible. Extra lives are awarded for every 1000 points.</desc>

		<name>Surround : Chase</name>
		<desc>Welcome to the exciting and competitive world of SURROUND. Your basic objective is to surround your opponent, causing him to run out of space in which to move, and at the same time not running into anything yourself. You can set up a blockade, force him into a corner or wander off by yourself and hope that he runs into something on his own.

Along with the basic SURROUND game, we've added four game features to make things more interesting. Be sure to read Section 4 to learn more about these features.

Then there's VIDEO GRAFFITI. It's just for fun without the competitive edge thrown in. VIDEO GRAFFITI actually allows you to draw on the screen.

Surround was one of the nine Atari 2600 launch titles released in September 1977.</desc>

		<desc>In this game you have entered some underground caverns on another planet. As you try to navigate your way through, you must destroy enemy space ships and force fields. You move the target reticle by moving the joystick and fire weapons by pressing the red button. You can see the ships coming in the distance but if they get too close they will fire on you, causing you to lose energy. If you see a force field, you will see a square to the right. Shoot the square to disable the field. If your ship hits the field, you lose energy. You gain energy when you destroy a ship or disable a force field. Use the map on the top of your screen to determine which path to take, left or right. If you choose the wrong path or run out of energy, the game is over.</desc>

Crash 'n' Dive
As you fall down an endless tunnel, turn the paddle to hit platforms of the same color for points. You can also hit bonus platforms but beware of deadly platforms.

Cave 1k
You must press the button to make the helicopter fly up. You constantly move forward and must avoid obstacles, the cave roof and the cave floor. The farther you get, the more your points.

The fourth option, 3-athlon, allows you to play all three games in succession, with you final score being the total from all three games.</desc>

The sets of numbers, for instance 16-4, were actually a combination of a page number and a panel number in the comic book that came with the game.

Mantra:
The screen will show various symbols. Move the joystick to match the sequence until the sequence completes and you receive points.

Jitter:
Much like Mantra, you must match the sequence but now, each time you match a symbol, your control moves, automatically, to the next in the sequence.

Flow:
You have to place bars around those placed by the CPU. As soon as a counter completes a given number, every CPU cell whose number of bars corresponds to the sum of adjacent bars placed by the player is removed, and points are scored.

Four:
Four has four mini-games. In Gate, you have to match symbols place by the CPU on a vertically scrolling column. In Here, you clear a cell whenever an arrow in inside each cell. Also in Four are Jitter 1K and Flow 1K, scaled down versions of their 4K cousins.</desc>

Beans appear randomly in the patch and you must eat them before the beetle at the bottom get from left to right to get the count down to zero. If the beetle gets to the right before you get the bean, two more beans will appear in the patch and two more beans are added to the count.

At times, Beeky the bird or Spanky the spider will pass through the bean patch. In later levels, an obstacle will appear in the middle of the patch.

You lose a life if you touch your head (yellow square) to the obstacle or the sides of the patch, touch your head to your body, or Spanky or Beeky touch your head (eat you).

The third patch is night. When you get a bean, you can see the patch for two seconds. If you need more looks, you can press the fire button for another two seconds of light but it costs you a bean.

The levels and their point values are:
Apple (5 points per bean, 50 points for the apple)
Orange (10 points per bean, 100 points for the orange)
Grape (15 points per bean, 150 points for the grapes)
Strawberry (20 points per bean, 200 points for the strawberry)

Occasionally a bizarre icon will appear on one of the lines and, should you grab it, will invoke a "cabarette"-style show which will keep some of the customers occupied.

In this game, you start out on the income screen where you try to collect the money (dollar signs) while avoiding the governmental red tape (look like red snakes). You have only one year to get your money and invest it. Each second, a day goes by. My, how time flies.

Once a season, you are sent to the investment/tax shelter screen, where you must collect an icon representing an investment and then grab your portfolio (briefcase). Investments have a 50/50 chance of making or losing money. Also on this screen is a character whose color changes.

What color he is determines who he is:
Black=Eggie, the IRS agent. If he catches you, he will audit you. In these audits, you always lose. You are then taxed at 50% of your income and sent back to the income screen.There are no appeals to tax court.
Pink=Waggie, the CPA. If he catches you (or you go to him), he will charge you $1,000.00 but whatever tax sheltered investment you have, he will put you in a better one.
Green=Toodles, the registered investment adviser. If you two meet, he will put you in the best tax sheltered investment available, thus making you the most profit.

After each season, you are taxed to an amount determined by your tax shelter. The object is to have $1,000,000.00 at the end of the year after taxes.</desc>

		<desc>The Activision Decathlon is a series of Olympic games similar to the Epyx games series. Up to four players can compete in the ten different events of a real-life decathlon, either in sequence or individually. Included are the 100-meter dash, long jump, shot put, high jump, 400-meter race, 110-meter hurdles, discus throw, pole vault, javelin throw, and 1500-meter race. 

The flat running events involve simple joystick waggling, which must be balanced with accurately-timed button presses to clear the hurdles - hitting them or breaking stride causes a loss of momentum and thus time. For jumping and throwing events, you must build momentum by waggling and then press the button to throw or jump at what you feel is the appropriate moment.

For each event, points are earned based on how well you do (this can be based on your running time, or how far you throw the javelin or discus, etc...), and the player with the most points at the end of the decathlon wins the gold medal.</desc>

		<desc>If The A-Team looks familiar it's because it is little more than a graphic hack of another unreleased Atari game called Saboteur.  At one point it was thought these games were the same except for the graphics, but after analyzing them I've found some slight gameplay differences.  On this page I'll concentrate on the differences between Saboteur and The A-Team, for more information on the gameplay itself look at the Saboteur page.  

It's unknown why Atari decided to change Saboteur into The A-Team, but we assume it's because they wanted a game based on the then popular A-Team TV show and didn't want to wait for a new game to be developed.  At that point Saboteur was ready for release and Atari decided that they would attempt to integrate A-Team characters into a game that was already finished.  The results are interesting at best, confusing to say the least.</desc>

		<desc>The Lord of the Rings: Journey to Rivendell has been the subject of speculation for many years by Atari collectors. Now one of the most sought-after Atari 2600 prototypes is finally available. What's the story, you ask?
Way back in 1983 Parker Brothers featured this game in one of their catalogs. Video game and Tolkien fans alike were excited by this announcement, but the wait would be in vain. Lord of the Rings was never released, and Parker Brothers reportedly informed people that called and asked for the game that it was sold out in an attempt to cover up for the fact that it was never published.</desc>

There are two types of tanks. The white Sentry tanks only move through existing tunnels and will only fire on you if there is clear space between you and them. The blue Digger tanks will create their own tunnels to pursue you. There is also a Sentry tank at the bottom of the screen that slowly moves towards your reserve tanks.

There are enemy supplies buried in random areas that if you get them will get you bonus points. Later levels have the bases only appear one at a time or have no dirt between you and the enemy tanks, leaving them to pursue you from the start.</desc>

Mad Dog growls and grabbing from behind drags Skin Head across the ring whipping him around in an airplane spin; letting go so he flies into the ropes and bounces back to meet Mad  Dog's concrete forearm across his neck... a perfectly executed clothesline. 

Wasting no time Mad Dog elbow drops him. Skin Head's face winces in pain as he fights his way up and staggers to his corner to tag his partner in. 

Big Chief takes the tag, grabs Mad Dog lifting him over his head and body slams him into the mat. Mad Dog's stunned, he's not getting up. 

Big Chief, looking for the pin, climbs the ropes for a dive. As he lunges into the air, Mad Dog scrambles to his feet and Big Chief's sweaty red skinned body splatters on the empty mat.</desc>

		<desc>To be born with wings...

Become a F-14 Naval Aviator undergoing seek and destroy missions while dodging and gunning enemy bogeys in deadly dogfights with your 20mm cannon and air-to-air missiles.

You cockpit comes with state of the art technology, courtesy of the U.S. Air Force: Display and main computer, Bogey Alert Indicator, G-Force Indicator, Electronic Counter Measures, and a Cannon Overheat Indicator (yes, it can overheat!)...and if your feeling up to it, give the ol'bird a boost to Mach 1.0!

The gameplay like other simulation games consists of taking off, flying, combat and landing. Though most of the gameplay focuses around dogfighting with enemy bogeys (dodging missiles). In addition to that, there are also night-flying missions that add difficulty due to limited vision.

Taking off and landing however, also required additional skill as your doing it on the USS Enterprise (No relation to Star Trek), not on your standard airstrip. Pay attention to the F.D. officer as your preparing to take off (since he's the boss when it comes to this stuff...and try no to run over him...yet).

Your weaponry consists of a M 61 Machine Gun and 3 different AIM Missiles (AIM 7, 9, 54) each packed with 15 missiles (that's a lot of missiles!).

After each mission you will receive a Mission Rating which is based on your flying skill, number of bogey kill and number of weapons fired.</desc>

Snack Attack moves across the top of the screen dropping snack food crumbs towards the teeth. You move at the bottom of the screen, just above the teeth. You must deflect the crumbs back up, hopefully hitting Snack Attack or a falling crumb for points. 

Each round is time-limited. You play until the time runs out then you get bonus points depending on weather you lost any teeth and how many. 

Occasionally, Snack Attack will try to swoop down and grab you. If you are caught, you lose a man. 

If one or more of your teeth are in danger of being lost, indicated by it flashing, you can press your fire button to Reach toothbrush, Johnson &amp; Johnson dental  floss and Act fluoride dental rinse to save that/those tooth/teeth. You get three of these cleanings to start but earn bonus cleanings every 50,000 points. 

The game is over after you lose all three of your men or lose three of your teeth.</desc>

A great reward for having gotten all of Santa's toys painted in record time. Unfortunately for you, Patrick's idea of "painting" toys was dumping them all in a bucket of gray paint. While this technically fulfilled his associates' obligations (thus their trip to the Bahamas), the toys--alas--still have to be painted properly.

It's now your job to clean up their mess, which means properly painting the toys in time for Santa's departure Christmas Eve. You must paint the toys as they move along five conveyor belts. Ahh, but only if it were as easy as it sounds! Toys must be painted the proper color, and some toys require two coats of paint (with different colors), and if that wasn't bad enough, some must have their coats applied in the proper order! And not that you needed the additional pressure, but you also have a daily quota to meet. You must properly paint all the toys that appear on the conveyor belts each day before the whistle at the end of your shift sounds!

Santa's counting on you to ensure that all the toys are painted correctly! Can you get the job done before Santa's sleigh is loaded up on Christmas Eve? You don't want to be responsible for children waking up Christmas morning without toys under their trees, do you? Time to juggle those cans of paint and get moving!</desc>

The MSX version replaces the hurdles with a 400 meter dash.

The NES version adds skeet shooting, triple jump, javelin throw, high jump, and archery as events but loses the hammer throw event. The NES version also keeps the 110 meter hurdles and forgoes the 400 meter dash.

If you want to go to the next event or round then you will have to qualify, by beating increasingly difficult maximum times or minimum distances. This game contains a two player option, in which the players take it in turns.</desc>

		<name>Tunnel Runner</name>
		<desc>Tunnel Runner is an advanced 3D Maze Game, essentially what a 1st person version of Pac-Man game would be like.  Because "Tunnel Runner" was designed with a built-in expanded memory chip (RAM Plus!), it's 12KB of memory gives it the ability to present the maze in three dimensions.  Therefore, the playfield is a colorful, three-dimensional maze, so you never see yourself... just the walls on either side of you that form the corridors you travel along.  As you move along the passage-ways, additional tunnels appear on either side, which you can turn into by pressing left and right.

Your primary goal is to locate and collect the hidden key, located in a different spot within each maze.  Through the assistance of a MAP, you can maneuver within the maze.  While attempting to locate the key to exit the level, you must also avoid the hungry Zot's.  You will discover these enemy creatures throughout the maze.  Successfully recovering the key without being intercepted by the Zot's opens the portal to the next level.  As you pass each level, you will discover that the complexity and difficulty increases, while your MAP gradually reveals less and less information ultimately, your map will be of little use, requiring you to survive solely by instincts and quick thinking!</desc>

		<path>./Turmoil (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Turmoil</name>
		<desc>Turmoil is a fast-paced shooter. You pilot a ship that is trapped within a chamber of seven tunnels.  Your ship can only move up and down along a vertical corridor connecting the tunnels.  You are not alone, however.  A variety of enemies travel along these tunnels, focused on destroying you.  Therefore, the ultimate objective of "Turmoil" is to zoom up and down the center alley and blast aliens as they streak by.  Keep shooting and keep moving, and you will survive to live another day!  As you move quickly up and down, you must also fire your own weapons into to the left or right side.  Part of the intensity of this game is driven by the fact that you can't stay in one place for too long.  If you do, an indestructible enemy will come flying at you, forcing to move onward once more.

The enemy ships you will encounter in each of the seven tunnels travel at a variety of unique speeds.  The faster a given enemy moves, the more points you will receive if you shoot them.  Occasionally when you destroy one of the enemy ships, a flashing orb will appear at the far end of the tunnel.  This is the one exception where you are not restricted to your vertical pathway.  In these situations you are allowed to move down the tunnel to recover it.  If you grab it quickly, it is worth bonus points.  If you hesitate, it hatches into a fast moving missile and will destroy you if you get in its way.
 
When you start a game of Turmoil, you are given five ships.  If you can blast all of the aliens in a level, you'll receive a bonus ship.  In addition to your current ship, you can hold as many as six reserve ships at one time.  You will loose a ship if you make contact with any of the passing aliens.  There are nine levels to the game, each with multiple waves to complete, and each one faster and more challenging then the previous level.  This is considered by many to be one of 20th Century Fox's best games.</desc>

The object is to drive around a twisty course and collect all the colored flags. You can jump over gaps and over or onto other cars. If you land on another car, you kill them and collect points. You can also collect things like balloons and ice cream cones for bonus points. The faster you collect all the flags, the bigger a time bonus you get.

In later levels, there are dead-ends or gaps and a vehicle that is carrying a flag you need, so you will need to jump on him. If you are hit by another vehicle or go off the course, you lose a life. In two player games, play alternates.</desc>

		<desc>Vanguard is an arcade style shooter for one or two players. Your goal is to pilot your spaceship to the City of Mystery which is located at the end of a heavily guarded tunnel, and once there destroy the creature Gond. The tunnel is broken up into several different zones, called the mountain zone, rainbow zone, stick zone, stripe zone, bleak zone, and City of Mystery. Each zone features different types of enemy spaceships to deal with, and can scroll either horizontally or vertically. In the mountain zone or stripe zone, you may also come across an energy pod marked with an 'E'. If you fly through this, your ship temporarily becomes invincible to the deadly cave walls and numerous enemies which are trying to stop you. When not invincible, your space ship is equipped with lasers to help destroy enemies. You can fire in four different directions, however your speed is decreased when firing. You also need to keep an eye on your fuel gauge; your fuel will deplete at a rapid rate, and your ship will crash if it runs out. Fuel is gained each time you destroy an enemy, so make sure you destroy as many as you can! When you finally make it through all the various zones of the tunnel and defeat Gond, the game will repeat at a more difficult skill level.</desc>

		<name>Venture II: The Abysmal Abyss</name>
		<desc>Venture II was created by Tim Snider as a sequel to the classic game Venture. Only 24 copies of Venture II were produced. The first four carts were part of a pre-production run so Tim could get the manufacturing process fine tuned. Those first four are marked with Greek letters on the label. Tim then created 20 numbered copies of Venture II which he made available privately at the 2001 Classic Gaming Expo. One copy of Venture II sold at the CGE2K1 auction and went for over $200. Tim created perhaps the most extravagant packaging seen for a self-published title at the time--the game was delivered in a hand-crafted, miniature treasure chest, which opened to reveal the cartridge (with numbered label) and a manual, surrounded by elegant, gold leaf paper.

If you'd like to purchase a copy of Venture II (sans the fancy treasure chest packaging), you can do so in the AtariAge Store. Included is a beautifully illustrated twelve page manual by Dale Crum.</desc>

		<name>Video Olympics : Pong Sports</name>
		<desc>Video Olympics is an action game containing numerous variations of the game Pong. Two players (or one player against the computer) control paddles on the screen and attempt to prevent a bouncing ball from getting past them. In the most basic game variations, each player has a single paddle and there are no obstacles on the screen. The other game variations add paddles and obstacles, and some are loosely inspired by various sports and change the playfield around, but the goal remains the same: hit the ball past your opponents paddle into the goal to earn points. A few of these variations are:

1. Foozpong: Each player controls multiple paddles which are arranged somewhat like a foozball table.

2. Soccer pong: Each player controls two paddles (representing one goalie and one player) and the goal is much narrower.

3. Hockey pong: The playfield is set up to resemble hockey; the goal isn't at the very edge of the screen, so the ball may bounce behind and around the goal.

4. Quadrapong: The goals are located along the top, right, bottom, and left sides of the screen. This game is played by four players, two per team with one person defending each of the four goals.

5. Handball pong: There is no goal, and two players take turns hitting the ball against a solid wall to earn points. One point is earned each time your opponent is unable to return the ball.

6. Volleyball pong: The screen is set up like a volleyball court with a "net" in the middle. Both players are along the bottom of the screen and need to bounce the ball past their opponent.

7. Basketball pong: Each player controls a paddle on the bottom of the screen, and attempts to hit the ball into their opponents basket at the top.</desc>

		<desc>You're warping along fine when suddenly you are caught and unable to maneuver. Suddenly, space pirates approach attempting to disable you so they can board. The only thing you have left is your tachyon launcher that moves back and forth and fires a tachyon beam. Hold off the space pirates for as long as you can.

Using your paddle controllers, move the tachyon launcher left or right and press the button to fire a tachyon beam. The beam only travels up. Destroy the pirates and avoid them colliding with you. Sometimes the pirates travel on groups. Destroy any pirate in a group to kill the whole group.  You only have one life. Once you die, player two can begin by pressing the button on their paddles or you can press the Reset switch to start a new game.

Game variations
The only variation is one or two player. The difficulty switches are not used.

Scoring
You score one point for each enemy killed. After sixteen points, the enemy start shooting photon shots at you to kill you from more of a distance.</desc>

These include:

1. Tank Mode: in this mode, you do not leave a trail behind you when you move.

2. Solid Arena Mode: the obstacles in the arena cannot be destroyed by your cannon, only worm trails or heads.

3. Unbreakable Mode: your cannon only hurts the opponent's head. Nothing else is affected by it.

4. First To: this allows you to set the ending score so game length will be manageable.

5. Sudden Death Mode: in this mode, if any player gets two points ahead of the other, they win.

6. Select Game/Random Game: selecting Random game changes most game options randomly before each round.

		<desc>Wing War is an action game where you control a dragon. Beginning in your underground cave, your goal is to capture a sparkling diamond. To do this, you will first need to unlock the secret passage by bringing a fire, water and air crystal back to your cave. Crystals can be found by exploring the various locations available, usually you will need to destroy one of the many enemies so they turn into a crystal. Fire and water crystals can not be in the cave alone at the same time, an air crystal must be placed between them; so you will need to bring back the crystals in the order fire, air, water or water, air, fire. Once you've done this a super crystal is formed unlocking the secret passage so you can try to get the diamond! Your dragon has a limited amount of energy; being hit by enemies will cause the energy to deplete, and the game ends when all of your dragons have lost all their energy.</desc>

		<desc>Wizard of Wor is an arcade shooter played from a top-down point of view.

The player controls a warrior who is trapped in a dungeon. The goal is to earn as many points as possible by shooting the numerous enemy creatures which wander about the maze like corridors. The creatures wander about at various speeds, may shoot darts at the player, and some even have the ability to disappear temporarily. At the bottom of the screen the player has a radar which can be used to locate creatures that are invisible.

When the the player completes a maze, a Worluk sometimes appears. This creature moves rapidly and will only be on the screen momentarily. If the player destroys the creature before it escapes, the next dungeon will become a double score dungeon and all creatures will be worth twice as many points. Occasionally the Wizard of Wor himself may appear! He moves quickly and can teleport around the maze. If they destroy him, the player will earn a large amount of points.

The game may be played by one player or two players simultaneously.</desc>

The Joystick Controller links you with a most profound vehicle of amusement, the rotary wing Word Zapper. It is armed with vertical and horizontal firing lasers and capable of incredible maneuverability.

Opposing you is the Scroll -- a diabolic device designed to wear out the wrist an boggle the mind. The Scroll parades the alphabet across the screen, taunting you to duplicate a word or scrambled letters flashed at the bottom of the screen.

You must shoot each letter in perfect order, and you must match three words or letter combinations within 99 seconds.

Sounds easy? Wait until you meet the Scroll's friend, the Asteroids.</desc>

You command a tank at the bottom of the screen. You can move left or right but you are always moving forward. You can control the forward speed by pushing up or down on the joystick.

As worms move back and forth you must shoot them so they don't touch your tank. Also shoot any blocks in you path. Try not to shoot fuel pagodas. Touch them to refuel. You can go to the far left or right of the screen and not get touched by a worm but you can't shoot them when you are there either.

In the two player games, you have selections on co-operative or competitive. In co-op, you have the same points and fuel tank. When one tank refuels, it refuels both. In competitive, you each have a score and fuel tank. You compete to get enemies and fuel.</desc>

Stage two is a space shoot out against hordes of enemy aircraft - those you failed to destroy in the first part of the task. Complete this and you reach the final battle with Zaxxon, with the game looping with increased difficulty if you can survive the first time. There are 3 distinct skill levels, while controls involve using forward to dive and back to climb, in the manner of flight simulation.</desc>

The game lasts for three minutes, and whoever scores more points by the end of that time wins. The game can be played at normal or high speed, and optionally one of the players can be handicapped to give an inexperienced player more of an advantage.</desc>

		<desc>Boxing shows a top-down view of two boxers, one white and one black. When close enough, a boxer can hit his opponent with a punch (executed by pressing the fire button on the Atari joystick). This causes his opponent to reel back slightly. Long punches score one point, while closer punches (power punches, from the manual) score two. There are no knockdowns or rounds. A match is completed either when one player lands 100 punches (a "knockout") or two minutes have elapsed (a "decision"). In the case of a decision, the player with the most landed punches is the winner. Ties are possible.
While the gameplay is simple, there are subtleties, such as getting an opponent on the "ropes" and "juggling" him back and forth between alternate punches.</desc>

		<desc>Civilization is doomed! You are our last hope! You must protect the Cosmic Kids from the Cosmic Creeps as they escape the orbit-decaying planet!

The first part of the game is The Voyage. You begin on the bottom in your Orbinaut. You must move to the space station at the top while avoiding plasma, which moves from top to bottom, and Space Skeeters, which move left to right or right to left. If you are hit by anything, you will spin off into space and must begin again. Releasing a new Orbinaut, however, also causes the planet to decay a little more

The second part of the game is The Rescue. A Cosmic Kid starts at the bottom left of the screen and moves to the right then goes up one level moving left, all the while being chased by one or two Cosmic Creeps. You, using the space station, must fire and time your shots to hit a Creep, sending them back to the bottom. If your shot hits the Kid, a new Kid must start at the bottom and the planet's orbit decays a little more.

If the planet's orbit decays completely or if a Cosmic Creep gets to the upper right of the screen, the game is over. You get 100 points for each Creep you shoot and 1500 points for each Kid you get to safety. You need to score 5000 points on the Rescue screen to advance to the next level, where you will start the Voyage again, only faster.</desc>

Through all this, you must shoot or avoid chimpanzees, orangutans and gorillas. Chimpanzees are harmless but orangutans can capture you and place you in a cage in the village and gorillas can capture you and/or shoot you. If you are captured, you must press your button to escape then head south to the desert. After the desert, you enter the poison caves. There are no apes here but you will lose a life point every second you are within. These caves are a maze you must get through but be advised that not all exits lead to the human stronghold. Some exits come out in the forest or desert. Once you reach the human stronghold, you will get a splash screen then your total points then you restart in the forest at a harder level.</desc>

		<name>MegaMania : A Space Nightmare</name>
		<desc>In Megamania, the gameplay resembles that of Space Invaders. Rather than being aliens or spaceships, however, the enemies in this game are various objects such as hamburgers, bow ties, and steam irons. The object is to shoot them down before the energy bar at the bottom of screen is depleted, all while avoiding the oncoming enemies and their own projectiles attacks. Each of the enemies fly in select patterns and as soon as they hit the bottom of the screen, they re-appear at the top until shot by the player. The player's spacecraft depicted in the game is a cross between the U.S.S. Enterprise and Klingon battlecruiser from the Star Trek universe.
Gameplay-wise and in terms of graphics, MegaMania bears a very strong resemblance to Sega's 1981 arcade title "Astro Blaster". Both games feature nearly identical patterns of approaching enemies with the player relying on an "Energy" meter. Also, the player's ship bears a remarkable similarity in both games.

When Megamania was originally sold, anyone who scored above 45,000 points could send Activision a picture of their screen and become an official Megamaniac. They also would receive an Official Megamaniac emblem.[2]
If a player exceeds a score of 999,999 the game ends.</desc>

In either version of the game with either one or two players, the speed at which the players run can be set to either fast or slow for an extra challenge or to handicap one team.</desc>

The good thing about Pin, other than that it doesn't actively chase you, is that if it lands on the Bubble Eater, it will pop it, too. When the Bubble Eater is popped, it turns into a glowing puddle for a short time. While it is a puddle, you can bounce on it without getting hurt.

Game variations
The game select switch just lets you start on levels one, two or three.

Levels
There are 5 waves per level.
Level 1: The Bubble can bounce on any square and it will turn on and stay on.
Level 2: The same as level 1 but all the squares of a horizontal row must be turned on before you go to another row.
Level 3: The same as level 1 but you must turn on horizontal rows 2, 4 and 6 before you turn on rows 1, 3 or 5.
Level 4: The Bubble can bounce on any square and turn it on, but if you bounce on it again it turns off then you must bounce on it once more to turn it on again.
Level 5: The same as level 4 but all the squares of a horizontal row must be turned on before you go to another row.
Level 6: The same as level 4 but you must turn on horizontal rows 2, 4 and 6 before you turn on rows 1, 3 or 5.

Scoring
You get 300 points the first time a Bubble Eater is popped in a wave.
You score points each time you turn on a step. In levels 4 to 6, you get points even if you are turning on a step a repeatedly.
You get points for completing a level and/or wave. The amount varies by what level or wave you completed.</desc>

		<desc>Guardian is an arcade action game for one or two players. In an intergalactic war, an enemy ship called Dromeda is attacking your home planets and you need to defend them! The planets are located at either the top or the bottom of the screen, and are defended by a shield. Dromeda is in the middle of the screen, and will be launching explosive devices at the planets. You control a spaceship which is the last hope to save the planets. Unfortunately, your ships lasers are unable to reach Dromeda, so you you must shoot the explosives as they come in. If you miss any explosives, they will destroy part of the shield. If a large enough hole forms, an explosive could get through and destroy an entire planet. The game ends when all of your planets have been destroyed.</desc>

		<name>Pac-Man</name>
		<desc>One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.

Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde).  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.

Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze.  During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points.  This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.</desc>

		<name>Omega Race</name>
		<desc>This is a remake of a Bally-Midway arcade game.  You control a spaceship and shoot down the enemy "Droid" ships that attack you.  Your ship must survive Droid-dropped mines too--but you can shoot them too.  The last ship of the Droid flights goes into a spiraling pattern.

There is no end to this game.  Rather, it is a game in which you try to get the highest score, or complete the highest number of levels.

You control a small triangle that is your ship.  The ship can turn, move forward (with thrusters) and fire.  Movement is one of the games challenges; once the ship is moving, it can only be slowed by turning the nose in the opposite direction and use the thrusters.  While doing that, the ship is unable to fire toward anything it is in motion toward.

Bouncing also comes into play during movement.  When the ship hits the side of the screen, a wall of force appears, and the ship bounces.  You don't have control over where the ship bounces, and must take time to regain control, before you run into an enemy ship and die.</desc>

The game environment consists of 4 floors, each with flying "bits" as well as enemy MCP attackers. The objective of the game is to control TRON (you) in a maze of platforms and elevators while trying to intercept the flying bits (intercepting bits on higher floors are awarded higher points).

Dodge enemy MCP attackers by jumping, using elevators and hitching a ride on the Silver Sailor. Capturing all 7 "bits" will take you to the next level, with added speed and difficulty.

You have a total of 4 lives in play. Make each one count!</desc>

		<desc>The lost city of Atlantis is under attack! Wave after wave of Gorgon vessels are approaching, each armed with weapons capable of destroying a part of the city. You are in charge of the command posts at the edges of the city and need to defend it from the invaders. The various Gorgon craft will keep flying by on the screen in varying numbers and in different flight patterns. At first they fly high in the sky but then progressively lower. If an enemy makes it low enough before you destroy it, it will use it's weapons and destroy one of the buildings in Atlantis. As you progress in the game, the enemy craft will keep increasing in speed. The game ends when all remaining buildings in the city have been destroyed.

Sounds familiar? It should. Atlantis II is an altered version of Atlantis When Imagic ran the Defend Atlantis contest, they wanted to find the top four highest-scoring players and invite them to Bermuda for a grand finale shoot-out for cash prizes. The top two-hundred fifty contestants would get snorkeling sets and the top one-thousand contestants would get t-shirts. Unfortunately, more than four people maxed out the score on Atlantis so, to break this tie, all of these maxed-out scorers were sent snorkeling sets and t-shirts as well as a modified Atlantis game called Atlantis II. The modified game is faster, scores lower per hit and the score font is different.</desc>

As the pilot of a snowspeeder, you need to take out as many of the walkers as you can. The walkers are heavily armoured, and it will take a lot of fire power to destroy one! The game is played on a large, scrolling screen with a radar screen at the bottom to help keep track of where the enemy is located. If a walker reaches the power generator, or you run out of snowspeeders the game is over. Good luck, and may the force be with you!</desc>

		<name>Oscar's Trash Race</name>
		<desc>It is the Grouch Day Picnic and three little grouches (Herman, Grungetta and Sloppy) want to win the Trash Race.

Game one is a practice race. The trash truck dumps one to five items. One of the trash cans at the top will then have a number on it. Press the button on the controller for that can the use the arrow keys to move it to the trash. Once you get the trash, move the grouch back to the top. You get one point per race. There are three races per game then Oscar appears to congratulate the winner (in his own grouchy way).

Game two is the same as game one except there will be a number on all three trash cans and you must select the one that corresponds to the number of items.

Both games one and two are one player only.

In games three and four, the truck dumps one to nine items. You again select the correct grouch but this time there are puddles, three in game three, several in game four. You get one point for each puddle you jump. If you step into a puddle, the grouch will play in it, delaying you. There are three races in game three, five in game four.

In game five, you run races one after another until Slimey the inchworm gets from one side of the screen to the other. Once Slimey get to the other side, the races ends. There are several puddles. You get one point per puddle jumped and one point per race completed.

Games six and seven are the same as five but it will rain sometimes. When it does, the puddles turn blue. If you jump a blue puddle, you get two points.

The trash items are:
bones
hangers
coffee mugs
toothbrush (presumably used)
old tin can
old televisions
old ten-gallon hats
old telephones
old tennis shoes
old dress shoes
junk mail
scissors
old toy boats
hammers
beach balls

For ages three to seven.</desc>

		<name>Laser Gates</name>
		<desc>Laser Gates is a side scrolling shooter. Failsafe detonators inside the cryptic computer have malfunctioned, and your job is to pilot a spaceship to destroy them before they explode. The narrow passage you'll need to fly through is well guarded: deadly force fields appear and disappear, rocket launchers attack, and deadly byte bats will get in your way. Your ship has a limited shield; each time you are hit by one of these enemies, the shield loses energy. When the shields energy is completely gone, the game ends. Also be on the lookout for energy pods which can replenish the shield (these don't appear often, so be sure not to miss one)! To deal with some of the enemies and obstacles your ship is equipped with a laser. Naturally, your mission is timed: you will need to make your way to the next detonator before time expires and it explodes! Points are earned by disabling the detonators, destroying enemies and successfully making it past the force fields.</desc>

You start at the bottom of the screen, on your base. You must push up to launch from your base, at which point you will begin consuming fuel. You must then make your way through drones that are moving left or right to the space cage at the top of the screen. When you are at the opening of the cage, where the food is, push up to retrieve it. Once you have the food, you must make your way back through  the drones to your base before you run out of fuel. If you die,  for whatever reason, before you return to your base with the food, you must restart the level at the bottom.

If your fuel gets too low (the indicator will turn red) your ship will actually slow down. Starting with level three, you must first grab a passkey from among the drones to open the cage and then go get the food and return.</desc>

		<path>./Video Chess (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Video Chess</name>
		<desc>This is an early home chess game. The standard U. S. chess rules are used in this game. To move a piece, place the X on the board onto the piece to be moved then press the red button. Next, move the X to where you want the piece to go and press the button again. If the move is illegal, the 2600 will give a warning sound and not make the move.

To castle your king, the king and rook must not have been moved. You move your king two squares in the direction of the rook to castle with. The 2600 will then automatically move your rook around your king, completing the move. You cannot castle out of check and you cannot castle to the king's side if any squares between the king and rook are threatened.

Another maneuver is called en passant. This move is used to counteract the enemy pawn's initial double move on a adjacent square.  To carry out the en passant, you must advance your
pawn to the fifth rank.  Your opponent then has the option of moving
his or her pawn one square (where it would be under attack) or two
squares.  If you opponent elects to move two squares, the en passant move allows you to take that pawn by diagonally moving your pawn to the square that was skipped over.

Skill levels
These determine how long the computer will think on its move. These times are approximate and may vary slightly, depending on what move you did.
Level 1=15 seconds
Level 2=30 seconds
Level 3=45 seconds
Level 4=2 minutes, 45 seconds
Level 5=3 minutes, 15 seconds
Level 6=12 minutes
Level 7=10 hours
Level 8=10 seconds

Level 8 is a beginner level.</desc>

Your goal is to destroy all of the Zylon fighters you encounter, rescue cadets that are trapped on Zylon planets, and to find the planet Solaris to protect it from the Zylons. Your spaceship is equipped with a galactic map which can be used to warp to different sectors of the galaxy. The map shows the location of Zylon squadrons, Zylon planets, federation starbases, wormholes, clusters of stars, and Solaris when you find it. By warping to the correct sector, you can battle the numerous types of Zylon fighters to keep them from attacking federation bases and planets. Your spaceship has a limited amount of fuel; when you see the fuel gage get too low, you will need to warp to a federation starbase to refuel (make sure you leave enough fuel to warp). When flying over a Zylon controlled planet, you will see your cadets on the surface. If you rescue all of the cadets as you fly past, you will receive bonus points and an extra spaceship. The Zylon's have many different types of fighters which you will encounter, as well as some narrow corridors with blockades which you will need to clear in order to reach new locations in the galaxy.</desc>

		<desc>The year is 2552. Planet Earth still exists, but overpopulation has forced many of her former residents to colonize other worlds. After contact with an outer colony was lost, a battlegroup was sent to investigate and was almost completely destroyed; only one badly damaged ship returned to tell of a seemingly unstoppable alien warship that had effortlessly annihilated their forces.

This was humankind's first encounter with a group of aliens they eventually came to know as the Covenant, a collective of alien races bent on wiping out humanity. A desperate plan is set in motion: board a Covenant vessel and learn the location of the Covenant home world. But before the mission begins, Covenant forces strike and annihilate the attack force.

The Covenant are now on Earth's doorstep. One ship escapes and makes a blind jump into deep space, hoping to lead the Covenant away from Earth. The ship crashes on Halo--an artificial ring world that is actually a weapon capable of destroying all life in the galaxy should it fall into the hands of the Covenant.

You are the Master Chief--all that remains of a classified military project to build a series of genetically enhanced super- soldiers. You are humanity's last and best hope against the Covenant--but you're woefully out-matched, and survival is not guaranteed. Can you battle your way through the massive world that is Halo, defeat the Covenant, and save humanity?</desc>

		<desc>It started with one station, then three, then eight. If something isn't done, the aliens will overrun Earth. It is up to you to destroy the stations by setting their self destructs.

You move from room to room, fighting any enemies you encounter. When you beat an enemy, you get an energy pod or oxygen bottle. Fighting aliens depletes you energy and/or oxygen so kill quickly. You also use oxygen at the rate of one bottle per minute while exploring.

Along the way, you will sometimes find sonic keys, and energy sword, sonic blaster or particle beam. Sonic keys are needed for certain doors you encounter in later stations.

Once you set the self destruct code, a clock starts and you must make it to the teleporter before the time runs out. The game ends when you destroy all eight stations, run out of oxygen or do not get off a station before it self destructs. If you run out of energy, the game does not end but you will not be able to use any weapon so you can't kill monsters so you can't replenish oxygen. Hence, the game won't go long if you run out of energy.

Weapon energy use and damage
Energy sword=1 energy and 2 strength
Sonic blaster=2 energy and 4 strength
Particle beam=4 energy and 8 strength.

		<name>M.A.D.</name>
		<desc>M.A.D. (which stands for Missile Attack and Defense) is an arcade action game somewhat similar to Missile Command. You control a photon cannon at the bottom of the screen, and your goal is to protect six energy stations located to your left and right. Waves of rockets and other ships will fly by on the screen, and occasionally one will drop in an attempt to destroy one of the stations (as a warning on most levels, the enemy will turn white just before it drops). You need to make sure you shoot it before your energy station is destroyed! When all six energy stations are gone, the game is over. A two player variation is also included; one player will control the photon cannon, and the second player controls a cursor and can select when and where an enemy will drop. The players alternate between offense and defense in this version.</desc>

		<name>2005 MiniGame MultiCart</name>
		<desc>This cartridge contains six of the 1 kilobyte entries and one 4 kilobyte entry from the 2005 Minigame Competition with an onscreen menu for selecting the games. The games are:

1. Hunchy: inspired by the Century Electronics game Hunchback, the player takes the role of Quasimodo and must rescue Esmeralda from the cathedral of Notre Dame. Quasimoto can jump across the roof, avoiding guards and assorted missiles.

2. Jetman: inspired by the 8-bit computer game Jetpac, the player must fuel a rocket but avoid getting shot from an unseen attacker.

3. Nightrider: the player is running from a hostile government. They are pursuing you with a helicopter. Just keep running and watch out for the terrain. The farther and longer along the Nightrider goes, the more freedom is worth.

4. Zirconium: an alien race, not carbon-based but zirconium-based, have invaded the galaxy. They have set space mines to protect their mothership. The player takes the role of Captain Joe Diamond, and must fight his way through these mines and destroy the mothership. Careful about hitting mines, as the ship can only take so many blows. Grab any power packs you can.

5. Rocket Command: magma beings are invading from the inside of a volcano. As the rocket commander, the player must destroy these beings' ships before they launch into the sky.

6. M-4: a port of a 1977 Midway arcade game of the same name. The player has unlimited lives and 90 seconds to destroy all that is seen for points. Points are awarded for hitting the wall, the opponent tank, a car and an airplane. If the player or the opponent are hit, the wall is rebuilt and both are returned to thier starting points, but the clock never pauses.

7. Marble Jumper: this is a puzzle game where the object is to clear the board of all but 1 marble, with the last one being in the middle. There are 33 squares and 16 marbles. The player clears marbles by jumping them vertically or horizontally, like in checkers. Diagonal jumps are not allowed.</desc>

		<desc>In Warlords, you need to defend yourself from three human and/or computer players. Each of the four players are in one of the corners of the screen guarded by a castle. You control a small shield which can be moved around the edge of the castle. To survive you need to use the shield to block a ball which bounces around the screen. If the ball hits your castle, it will take out some of the bricks. If a hole forms in the castle wall and the ball makes it though and hits your warlord, then you are out of the game. The last player left alive wins the battle, and the first player to win five battles wins the game! Several game options are included which allow you to either catch or ricochet the ball when the shield touches it, and control the speed of the game.</desc>

		<desc>In Yars' Revenge, your goal is to destroy the Qotile laser-base which is located on the right side of the screen behind a shield. You control the fly-like Yar, which can destroy the shield piece by piece by either shooting it or running into it. Once the shield is down, you will need to use the Zorlon cannon to destroy the Qotile. The Zorlon cannon is located on the left side of the screen, and when fired can destroy the Qotile with a direct hit. The Qotile isn't completely unarmed against your attacks, however. Wandering around the screen is a destroyer missile, which will constantly be homing in on your Yar. This missile can not be destroyed, however you can temporarily hide from it in a shield which runs vertically in the center of the screen. The Yar will be unable to fire when hiding in the shield so you can't stay there indefinitely! The Qotiles second weapon is a swirl which it will randomly fire at you and should be dodged. When you finally destroy the Qotile you can move on to the next, faster round of gameplay. Several game variations are included which control the difficulty and speed of the game.</desc>

Using the joystick you can choose from one of five different offensive or defensive plays. In the first game variation, after selecting a play you then control the players on the field. In the second game, you have the option of controller your players after a play is selected or allowing the computer to control the players. The third game has the computer controlling the players at all times and you only need to select the plays you wish it to execute  and indicate when you wish to punt or pass the ball. In all of the game variations the timer begins at 5 minutes, and is active only during plays. Of course, the team with the most points when the timer runs out wins!</desc>

		<desc>You hear faint footsteps, so you follow the sound through the 
maze.  To your horror, you discover the source of the footsteps 
is a Skeleton; and it doesn't look friendly.  Acting quickly, 
you blast it with your Undead Disintegrator and the Skeleton 
vanishes in a flash of colour.  But as you reload your UD, you 
hear footsteps again; and you wonder; are you the hunter or the 
hunted in this nightmare?

This game was inspired by the TRS-80 CoCo game The Phantom Slayer. In this title, you move through a maze, searching for skeletons. Find them before they find you. Once you encounter a skeleton, press a button to disintegrate it. There are ten skeletons per maze and eight mazes in total.</desc>

		<name>Saboteur</name>
		<desc>You are Hotot, a cybernetic life form from a serene planet in a distant galaxy. Unfortunately, even in a galaxy far far away not everything is as peaceful as it first seems, for Hotot has discovered an alien missile base hidden on his planet. Manned by strange blue aliens, these evil intruders are using your planet as a launching site for their deadly warhead which is posed to destroy the galaxy's power source. With the help of the birdlike Gorfons, you must destroy the warhead, and prevent the destruction of the galaxy! Good luck Hotot. You are the Saboteur.

On the first screen, you are trying to prevent the Qotile construction robots and Yar slaves from completing a missile. You will be helped by the Gorfrons. While the Qotile construction robots and Yar slaves will build up the missile, the Gorfrons will steal pieces to lower it. Beware of the Master robot on the top catwalk as it will try to shoot you and the Gorfrons to prevent your interference. After you finish the Rocket Construction Site, it is off to Warhead Assembly.

In Warhead Assembly, you must destroy the warhead parts on the conveyor belt. There is just one little problem; the conveyor belt is protected by a field. The good news is that the Master robot's energy is on the same frequency so what you do is shoot the Master robot and the shot will then head for the conveyor belt. Of course, the Master robot isn't just standing there, letting you bounce shots off him. He has released a security drone that bounces around the screen trying to hit you.Also, the Master robot will hurt you if you touch him. If you destroy the parts before time runs out, you will advance to a harder round. If not, you must destroy the warhead one-on-one.

In the Warhead Showdown, you must destroy the warhead with a shot. Of course, the warhead isn't gonna stand for that as it has an impressive defense matrix that will try to hold you off. If you take to log to destroy the warhead, it will escape into space. Whether you destroy it or not, you will then return to the Rocket Construction Site at a harder level.</desc>

		<desc>An evil magician has stolen the Enchanted Chalice and has hidden it somewhere in the Kingdom. The object of the game is to rescue the Enchanted Chalice and place it inside the Golden Castle where it belongs. 

This is no easy task, as the Evil Magician has created three Dragons to hinder you in your quest for the Golden Chalice. There is Yorgie, the Yellow Dragon, who is just plain mean; there is Grundle, the Green Dragon, who is mean and ferocious; and there is Rhindle, the Red Dragon, who is the most ferocious of all. Rhindle is also the fastest Dragon and is the most difficult to outmaneuver.

There are three castles in the Kingdom; the White Castle, the Black Castle, and the Golden Castle. Each castle has a Gate over the entrance. The Gate can be opened with the corresponding colored Key. Inside each Castle are rooms(or dungeons, depending at which Skill Level you are playing).

The Castles are separated by rooms, pathways, and labyrinths. Common to all the Skill Levels is the Blue Labyrinth through which you must find your way to the Black Castle. Skill Levels 2 and 3 have a more complicated Kingdom

Adventure was the first action-adventure game on a video console, the first to contain a widely-known Easter egg, and the first to allow a player to have a stash of items, which required the player to select which one to use at any given moment, usually through keyboard or joystick input. Adventure allowed the player to drop one item and pick up another without having to type in any commands. The graphics, on the other hand, were not that great, and Adventure creator Warren Robinett even described the dragons as looking like ducks.</desc>

The object of the game is to find pieces of E.T.'s phone. Once all pieces are found, E.T. calls home and the spaceship arrives to pick him up. E.T. can collect Reese's Pieces scattered around in order to regain energy which is constantly depleted with time. 

The phone pieces are in some of the pits, and E.T. must jump in to get them; sometimes there's also a dead flower in the pit which provides extra points if brought back to life. Once E.T. has done his business in the pit, to get out he must levitate his way out, though he must watch out not to fall into the pit again after leaving. 

Evil scientists and agents wander around the area, trying to capture E.T. and steal the parts he's carrying.</desc>

Food starts on the left and moves to the right. You move the mouth to eat the food; the more fattening, the better. After eating several food items, you get the message that you're getting fatter. Then a faster round begins or, in a two-player game, player two plays. The green pickles are fine but avoid the purple pickles. If you eat six purple pickles during the game, you will burp, ending the game. You will then see a closed sign for the snack bar.
