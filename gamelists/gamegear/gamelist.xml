		<path>./Andre Agassi Tennis (USA).7z</path>
		<name>Andre Agassi Tennis</name>
		<desc>A game endorsed by the American player who stunned the tennis world in the early 90s with his "Image is everything" looks, sporting long hair, earrings and colorful shirts, Andre Agassi Tennis includes eight players (male and female and as as expected, only Agassi is a real player) rated according to movement speed and both accuracy and strength on serve, backhand and forehand.

Gameplay features all the usual moves: smashes, passing shots, volleys and all kinds of backhand and forehand plays, but unlike other games, precise positioning and timing are crucial to avoid hitting the ball outside the court, swinging the racket into thin air or more embarrassing, let the ball hit you on the head.
Three courts are available: Grass, Clay and Indoor (Sega versions  add a fourth, Hard), but the differences between them are minimal. Game modes change according to the version, with the 16-bit versions including a "Skins" game, where each point is worth a sum of money based on the number of times the ball was hit.</desc>

		<path>./Arena (USA, Europe).7z</path>
		<name>Arena: Maze of Death</name>
		<desc>In the year 2026, a corrupt government has used a television broadcasting company called Astralnet Broadcasting Company to secretly control the population and keep them brainwashed.  During these times a group of pro-democratic rebels, led by Guy Freelander, has obtained a secret taped meeting between top government officials and ABC directors discussing their diabolical plans.  Convinced that if they play the tape through ABC's broadcasting, they can convince the repressed population to rise up against the current regime.  The only problem that stands in their way is the way to the broadcasting center, a death trap nicknamed the maze.

The player takes control of Guy Freelander and must transverse this maze, with 20 levels and 100 different rooms in total, using a standard gun and a knife to take out security guards, androids, mutants and must avoid various pitfalls and traps scattered in these rooms.  The view of the game is isometric and has a password feature to allow players to pick up and return to the previous room they were in without having to replay the previous levels.  There are no life bars, instead the player can take four hits before their character dies with five lives.  After losing these five lives, the game will be over.</desc>

		<name>Astérix and the Great Rescue</name>
		<desc>The game is based on the popular French comics series Astérix. It is 50 B.C., and the entire Gaul (today's France) is conquered by the Romans. Only one village still remains independent, thanks to the incredible powers of its two great warriors, Asterix and Obelix. In the game, they must first of all liberate the village Orvio and rescue their friend Dogmatix.

You can play as either Asterix or Obelix. You make your way through platform levels, fighting enemies by punching them, and jumping to access higher ares or to avoid falling down. There are also some items you can collect, such as bombs, with which you can overcome obstacles and advance in the game.

		<name>Asterix and the Secret Mission</name>
		<desc>The druid Getafix is out of magic potion, and Astérix and Obelix are set out on a secret mission: to find the necessary herbs, so he can brew the potion again.

In this side-scrolling action game, the player can choose to play either Astérix or Obelix at the start of each one of the six levels. Although the main setting of each level is the same to both characters (forests, caves, deserts, underwater stages, waterfalls and such) the level design for each one may vary. In two player mode (Master System version), players will take turns playing as Astérix and Obelix. Both characters jump (by pressing button 2), punch enemies and break blocks (by pressing button 1). Astérix can run can run (by pressing and holding button 1 while moving) and double jump (by pressing 2 in the middle of a jump). Obélix is stronger and can break several bricks in a row when jumping over them (pressing 1 while jumping), and can also slide down hills (by pressing down at them).

Astérix can get some potions (thrown by pressing up and 1), which can break rocks, kill or shrink enemies. Obelix can get miniature menhirs which can be thrown (by pressing up and 1) against enemies. Both characters can also get bones throughout the game, granting access to bonus stages where the player controls Dogmatix. Some levels also involve minor puzzle solving, like pushing switches or moving rock blocks.

		<path>./Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP II (USA, Europe).7z</path>
		<name>Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP II</name>
		<desc>Ayrton Senna won the Monaco Grand Prix six times, as well as 3 Formula One world championships, so he was the perfect man to license a home sequel to the classic arcade racing game. As before, the action is viewed from within the cockpit, but depicted using sprites rather than polygons. 

There are three main modes:

1. Senna GP: Features three non-championship circuits with a preliminary race followed by three laps. 

2. World Championship: The full 16-race championship. There are two modes in the championship mode that affect how the game is played. Beginner is a regular season, with the same difficulty level as the remaining modes, and cars have roughly the same power. Each race has three laps. In Master things get a twist. There are five groups of cars, and the player starts on the lowly competitive SERGA team. To climb the ranks and get a chance of claim the title the player must challenge a driver from other team and beat him to the top spot. The winner of this particular race gets (or holds) the fastest car. Races are also longer in this mode, and pit-stops are activated, required if the player knocks on too many objects or other cars frequently. 

3. Free Practice: This allows the player to drive on any race without caring for championship positions. There are two options in Free Practice: Free Run is just the player against the clock and Image Training is a race, but instead of having to quality and then run the three laps, the player can set the number of laps (between one and six), starting position and the condition of the track (dry or wet, only on some circuits).

While each mode presents it's own variations, the core of each race is the same: Along controller setup options, the player can choose between an Automatic or Manual with 4 or 7 speeds gearbox, and races against 16 drivers. The car can be instantly wrecked if it goes on top speed against a roadside object.</desc>

		<name>Baku Baku</name>
		<desc>The Minister approaches the King to tell him that his only daughter, the Princess, wants a new pet. But the King says she already has too many, and she can't take care of so many animals. Thus the Minister purposes a contest of skill and daring to select the Royal Zookeeper. Master Piggy then sends his pupil, Polly, to participate in the contest.

Baku Baku Animal is a variation on the very often copied Tetris type of game. The game has three different play modes: practice, normal and hard. It also can be played by two players against each other (except for the Master System version).

The objective is to pair animal heads with their respective food. If a rabbit head comes falling, you must make it fall on a pile of carrot tiles, dog heads with bones, panda heads with bamboos and monkey heads with bananas. There is a bonus item, the "BB coin", which will appear from times to times, and remove piled tiles from the playfield. Removed tiles will be sent to the opponent's playfield all at once, increasing the difficulty of the task. Polly will face several contestants, and she'll win when her opponents get their playfield piled to the top.</desc>

		<name>Batman Forever</name>
		<desc>Batman Forever is the officially licensed game based on the 1995 movie. The bad guys this time around are the Riddler and Two-Face.

This game is an usual hybrid of side-scrolling platformer and one-on-one fighter. The player makes way through levels that include some platform jumping elements, but take on opponents one at a time like in a fighting game. The player's arsenal includes a lot of nifty bat-gadgets and a collection of fighting moves that are unleashed with special button combinations.

The graphics were rendered completely with digitized actors and objects, but none of the actors from the movie make an appearance in the game.</desc>

		<name>Batman Returns</name>
		<desc>From Sega 8-bit specialists Aspect comes one of many adaptations of Tim Burton's 1992 superhero sequel Batman Returns. Like other versions, it is a side-scrolling platformer. While very similar to the Master System version, the Game Gear version has slightly different levels and gameplay mechanics.

Batman must move through five stages on his way to defeat the Penguin. These include the streets and rooftops of Gotham City, Max Shreck's department store, the sewers, and the Penguin's lair. For the first four levels, a route can be selected from two options, allowing for different paths through the game.

Enemies standing in Batman's way can be defeated by throwing the Batarang at them, which will take out most baddies with one or just a few hits, even though the weapon's range is limited. Other tools Batman can use are a grappling hook to pull himself up to higher levels or swing across dangerous areas, and his cape, which can be used as a parachute, for more control during falls.

Unlike in the Master System version, Batman can take more than one hit: he has a health bar, which can be refilled with powerups hidden in bat symbols.</desc>

		<desc>Bram Stroker's Dracula is a side-scroller platform game loosely based on the 1992 film of the same name. Players take the role of Jonathan Harker whose mission to to destroy Count Dracula by first heading to Transylvania and then London.

Jonathan Harker can move left and right, jump and attack with a weapon, the most basic of which is a knife. The status display on the screen shows Harker's health bar, countdown timer to complete the level and currently held weapon.  Throughout the levels question mark boxes (similar to the Mario games) can be found, attacking these will reveal power ups which include health restoration, timer increase and new weapons. Among these new weapons are axes, daggers and a shotgun. Question mark boxes can also be used as platforms to reach other areas and enemies. Each stage is divided into two sections: the "Daytime" and the "Nighttime". These are entirely different levels comparable to stage 1-a and 1-b. Harker must jump to various platforms and obstacles and defeat minor enemies throughout the levels. The end of a Nighttime level is usually guarded by a boss creature who must be defeated to progress.</desc>

		<desc>Bubble Bobble is the story of two humans, Bub and Bob who wander into the mysterious cave of monsters and magically turn into dinosaurs. The only way to transform back is to reach the end of the cave...

Bubble Bobble is a platform game, with each level being a single screen. The enemies must be cleared from a level to go to the next one. With one player controlling Bub and the other controlling Bob, the player can jump and collect items for points (such as fruit). The real power Bub and Bob have however is the ability to blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms. Taking too long to complete any level will summon Baron Von Blubba, who will float around the screen trying to destroy the player.</desc>

		<name>Castle of Illusion starring Mickey Mouse</name>
		<desc>Sega's 8-bit systems received their own version of the Genesis' popular Disney platformer. Story and themes remain the same, but the game has unique levels and slightly different gameplay mechanics.

To save his girlfriend Minnie from the evil witch Mizrabel, Mickey Mouse must venture into the Castle of Illusion. Crossing six levels (including a magical forest, a toy land and a candy world), he must collect the gems of the rainbow in order to confront and defeat the witch.

Each level features unique obstacles, enemies and a final boss. The enemies can be defeated by jumping on top of them. An alternative way is to pick up objects lying around (like rocks in the forest or blue balls in the toy level) and throwing them at the enemies. Mickey's ability to pick up things and carry them around also leads to puzzle-oriented gameplay. By placing objects in the right spot and jumping off of them, he can get to areas otherwise out of reach. In some levels, he also has to collect keys to open doors. A unique type of object is the treasure chest - by jumping on top of one or throwing it, Mickey gets access to its contents, which might include extra lives, a health power-up or coins to collect for points.</desc>

		<name>Chuck Rock II: Son of Chuck</name>
		<desc>The story in this Chuck Rock game takes up a little while after the end of the first game.  As you may remember, Chuck Rock had to rescue his girl, Ophelia from the bad dude Gary Gritter.  Well, he was successful in his efforts, and now Chuck and Ophelia are married.  Eventually, they have a son, named Junior. Chuck works in a factory, where he develops great skill at carving automobiles out of stone. A rival manufacturer becomes jealous of Chuck's abilities and kidnaps him.  Now it is up to Junior to rescue his dad!

The gameplay in this sequel is similar to the first game, but with some minor differences since you are playing as Junior, rather than Chuck. This is a side-scrolling platform game with occasional rock-moving puzzles thrown in. Unlike Chuck, Junior carries a club that gives his attacks further reach.

		<name>Columns</name>
		<desc>Columns is loosely derived from Tetris, as it involves arranging falling blocks in such a way as to clear them. However, in columns they are groups of 3 same-size but varying color blocks, which must be arranged into sequences of 3 or more, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Sequences of 4 or 5 count for double or triple points, and diagonal sequences score the most. The real trick is to set up 'combos' - where one line causes other blocks to drop so as to create other lines.

As well as the normal game mode, there is also a 'flash' mode, in which the aim is simply to remove a particular block from the base of the pre-formed pile of bricks. The difficulty of this can be determined by increasing the number of complete rows which are already in place.</desc>

To reach many new locations involves the action mode, where you will need to cross treacherous landscapes and evade dangerous creatures. This portion resembles a side scrolling platform game.

		<name>Dragon Crystal</name>
		<desc>Dragon Crystal is a dungeon crawler with RPG elements, along the lines of classics such as Rogue or Nethack. Without relying on a story, the game throws you into a randomly generated world which you should explore carefully - and most importantly, where you must survive! The complex, maze-like levels reveal their structure only after you cover the corresponding map areas. Your goal in each level is to reach a teleporter which will take you to the next one. There are also a lot of random items scattered around - weapons, armor, money, and food. Money allows you to continue the game if you die, food prevents you from starving. The enemies are visible on screen, and you fight them in a fast-paced turn-based combat, moving around and pressing direction arrows to strike with the equipped weapon. You are always accompanied by an egg which will eventually grow up to be a dragon if you have leveled up enough.</desc>

		<desc>Dropzone was the first game to propel Archer Maclean to stardom. The game, originally written for the 8-bit Ataris, is basically a Defender clone, but popular because it so closely recreates the gameplay of the original Defender, with its speedy scrolling and frantic gameplay.

The player is a spaceman with a jet-pack, flying across a barren landscape whose skies are inhabited by a number of different aliens; from the simple Planter to the slowly advancing Blunder Storm or the quick, aggressive Nemesite. 

Planters and Nemesites will try to pickup the small men walking on the surface, who must then be rescued. You must shoot down the alien, while avoiding to hit the man. Sometimes, the aliens will carry an android, which is similar to the human but deadly. Care must be taken so as to not pick up the androids. All men must be transported to a surface base, where they are put in safety. This is the Dropzone.</desc>

Rather than the traditional power-ups, Dynamite Headdy enables you to swap your head for different kinds  such as heads that heal you or heads that stick on to walls. You use your head in order to climb up on platforms as well, as you can grab hold of things with it, and on certain stages of the Mega Drive/Genesis version it is used to turn the game into a side-scrolling shooter, as you gain a propeller, jet, or bird head. Basically, Dynamite Headdy is just a traditional platformer at heart.</desc>

The player can choose to see the fight from his or from the opponent's point of view ("through his eyes").


The players can choose the view mode (normal or reverse), three kinds of control schemes, round length (up to four minutes) and fight length (up to 12 rounds).

		<desc>Mister Greede, a corrupt tycoon and factory owner, deprives the local citizens of the goods they need and deserve. Thats why you have infiltrated his factory. Now you must manipulate the conveyor belts skillfully to deliver the correct product to the right person waiting outside, but you have only a limited amount of time. Unfortunately, thugs with bats or even guns patrol the factory. Your only weapon against these security guards is a battle cry that temporarily stuns them, but not for too long.

Factory Panic consists of four rounds, and each round consists of eight stages. Before a stage starts, the game tells you how many people are waiting in line and what product they are waiting for. Rounds one and three are played in Switch Mode: step on different switches to rotate associated sections of the conveyor belt. If you get off the switch, the section rotates back to its initial position. One switch may affect more than one section. Since you can only step on one switch at a time, you have to bustle quite a bit in later stages. Rounds two and four are played in Bridge Mode: remove and install small bridges between the belts to control the flow of products.

If a person gets an unwanted product, the time remaining on the timer will decrease. Sometimes, the belt carries special items, e.g. a megaphone that makes your scream attack more powerful, or a weight that can be placed on a switch.</desc>

The most technically-advanced of Dizzy's adventure games in many ways, it was the only one to feature actual scrolling rather than a flick-screen system, the only one not to be released for the 8 bit computers the character originated on, the only one to originate on a console, as well as featuring many mini-games, such as Bubble Dizzy and an Operation Wolf clone. 

Gameplay involves walking Dizzy through the levels, picking up objects and using them to solve simple puzzles. There are plenty of tests of arcade skill along the way as well, as gaps must be jumped and baddies avoided - starting with a limited number of lives, the player can earn more by completing Theodore's puzzle. Before rescuing Daisy the player must capture all stars that unlock the gates of the tower.

		<desc>The game that started the best-selling series licensed by football's world governing body, this first installment in the long running series used a dimetric (colloquially known as "isometric") viewpoint, previously unusual in football games but quickly imitated by several titles. The televisual presentation, one of the unique points of the early EA Sports titles, with hosts introducing the matches, was another thing making the game stand out from a market dominated by Sensible Soccer and Kick Off games.

Based on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in each skill area rated out of 10 to give the player an overall impression of how good they are. The options available follow the standard set: fouls and offsides can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer operates  continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders and strikers cover.</desc>

There were a number of factors that made FIFA96 stand out from the crowd of other football sims. Firstly, the game's commentary was revolutionary at the time -- the renowned British commentator John Motson comments all the incidents and happenings on the pitch in real-time. The ambient commentary is varied, and systems with more than the minimum memory level get extra commentary phrases.

The Virtual Stadium technology has numerous pre-defined camera angles. The game even has a SVGA mode for better-than-minimum system

FIFA96 boasts eleven leagues from all around the world, ranging from the unknown players of the Malaysian league to the celebrated stars of the English and Italian leagues. 59 International teams are also featured, and it's possible to match the teams you want to against each other through friendlies, or you can also choose to play domestic tournaments or International ones such as the World Cup. If you're not satisfied with the composition of the various teams, you can create your own dream team through the custom team creator.</desc>

In both of these modes you complete a certain number of laps (4, 8, or 12) and select which circuit that you want to race on. The circuits include San Marino, France, Britain, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Japan, and Australia. Some circuits are easy, while some are difficult. 

There are slight differences between the two modes. For instance, "Arcade" allows you to select the circuit in any order that you like, whereas "Grand Prix" only allows you to fine-tune your car before starting a race. You also need to race a circuit in the order that they appear on the circuit selection screen, but you can skip a track if you want. 

F1 is a 1-2 player game, meaning that if you have another player handy, you can compete against each other.</desc>

Unlike most other platform games of its time, Garfield boasted completely unique art on each of its six levels, both for tile art and character costumes. The levels are inspired by classic movies, but given a Garfield twist, like "Catsablanca" and "The Curse of Cleofartra.

		<desc>This top-down puzzle game starts with a screen featuring a number of red cogs at different parts of the screen, and a grid of pegs (which become less complete on later levels). Your task on each level is to use a number of gears of one of 3 different sizes to ensure that all the pegs are linked together. All this has to be completed before the engine overheats.

Making life harder are two creatures with the peculiar name Poffins. One of these goes around removing pegs, and the other causes the engine to overheat further. They can be shot out of the way, or have gears placed over them to stop them.

Theres also a bonus round, which is a fruit machine, only with cogs and other things from the game rather than fruit.</desc>

		<name>George Foreman's KO Boxing</name>
		<desc>The Master System and Game Gear versions of George Foreman's KO Boxing are fairly identical to the other versions in concept, but there are a few notable changes. The game is a reworking of the Master System title James 'Buster' Douglas Knockout Boxing, not to be confused with the Genesis title with the same name, which is entirely different.

Just like the other versions players are cast as George Foreman to go through a series of boxing matches against different opponents to win the championship title belt. Compared to the other titles, these versions have new opponents and show the boxers from the side. Players can move left or right in the ring to avoid punches. Other moves including blocking, and left and right punches that can be varied into jabs and crosses. Matches can last up to ten rounds and when no regular or technical knock-out occurs, the winner is based on the jury's points, provided between the rounds. During knock-out phases, no buttons need to be pressed to get the boxer back to his feet. At the start of the game, a slow or fast speed for the gameplay can be selected.

Each match the player's boxer can use three super punches. These need to be charged and then unleashed when near an opponent. It sends them straight to the back of the ring, a dangerous area as it is easy to keep punching them into the ropes. Health is slightly restored during the intermission and after each won match the player is awarded skill points to be distributed over three characteristics. Matches for two players are supported.</desc>

		<desc>The Citizens Defence Force does not trust the United Nations to keep a troubled 21st century world at peace. It confiscates a horde of planes and warships, and as a UN loyalist, it is your job to shoot them down. Solving starvation and disease can wait, apparently.

The game is split into 8 stages, which are split into sub-stages over land and sea, each of which has a strict time limit, and a target number of planes to shoot down. They take place from behind your plane, which can be controlled with up referring to climb or dive, depending on player preference. You are armed with 10 missiles as well as standard weapons. The plane can survive a few hits, so watch the damage report as it goes from red to black. 

Fail to complete a section in the time limit and you use up a continue, but the amount of planes previously shot down is not reset, making the second attempt easier Chase HQ style. As you destroy enemies you gain access to better planes, and the rank reported at the end of the game improves  this is also dependent on the skill level you play at.</desc>

A bikini clad girl tells him that the pendant was made by the Aztecs long ago, and that they cursed it so that whoever wears it will be attacked by any animal that comes near them. Worst of all the person wearing it is unable to surf. The only way Greendog can lift the curse and remove the pendant is to find the six pieces of Aztec treasure and put them all together and the only knowledge of the whereabouts of the treasure is stamped on the back of the pendant.

The gameplay involves you getting from the left end of the level to the right while fighting off wild animals with your trusty Frisbee and using your athletic skills to jump over platforms.

You are the last chance for Earth, piloting a craft specially developed to engage these hordes. You must fight your way through their defenses to the final goal, the alien base. The final battle is about to commence!

Halley Wars is a vertical scrolling shooter. The game has 6 stages set in locations in space such as, above planets or in asteroid fields. There are end of levels bosses at the end of each stage each with their own weaknesses. There are power-ups, which can be picked up along the way when you shoot particular asteroids or satellites. These upgrade your weapon strength, speed, add explosive pods and shields.

Where the game stood out was, there are comets that need to be destroyed on your journey. Each comet and ship that you dont shoot makes it to earth and does some damage there. Comets do more damage than the enemy ships do. If Earths damage level reaches 100% the game is over. For every 2000 points you score, 1% of Earths damage is repaired.</desc>

		<name>Jurassic Park</name>
		<desc>One of many games based on the 1993 blockbuster Jurassic Park, the version for Sega's 8-bit systems combines side-scrolling shooting action and platforming levels.

In each of the five stages of the game, one escaped dinosaur species must be recaptured. Each level begins with a side-scrolling driving section. Dinosaurs attack the car and must be fend off by firing at them with a crosshair. If the player survives long enough, a boss battle against an especially powerful dinosaur follows.

After the completion of the driving section the level continues with a platform section. The player must jump, duck and climb to survive moving lifts, floors that will crumble under his feet, environmental hazards like acid drops, steam leaks or giant boulders and more. Dinosaurs will of course also stand in the way, but can be defeated by using several weapons: a rifle, a grenade launcher and hand grenades. Navigating the often maze-like levels will lead to the dinosaur that must be captured and a corresponding boss fight.

The first four levels (featuring a Velociraptor, Pteranodon, Triceratops and Brachiosaurus) can be tackled in any order, but the final level, featuring the Tyrannosaurus Rex, is only unlocked when the others have been completed.</desc>

		<desc>Young Simba just can't wait to be king. His father is the current King of the Savannah and the young prince is able to frolic the lands at will; jumping on and around other subjects of this animal kingdom. When Simba's father, King Mufasa, is killed and his evil brother Scar takes over the kingdom, Simba is banished from the lands of his birthright and has to grow up fast, honing his skills, for the day of his return.

The Lion King, based on the famous Disney movie, is a platform game where you control Simba - initially as a young cub, and later as an adult lion. The plot of the game follows the plot of the movie. Each of the levels represents a part of the movie. 

As young Simba, you can fight various beasts, such as lizards, by jumping on them. You can also roar to scare some creatures into submission, though every time you roar, you have to wait for your "roar meter" to charge. 

As an adult lion, you can still roar and jump, but now you fight enemies by slashing at them with your claws (if you're skillful enough, you can also grab them and toss them off the screen). 

The game features no in-game save function, and it needs to be replayed from the beginning every time.

		<desc>Magical Puzzle Popils is a single screen platform puzzle game. The object in each round is to go through the labyrinth until the player reaches the princess (or the princess reaches the player). The player can break blocks, climb ladders, go through portals. There are also hazards to avoid, like red spikes and enemies.

Breaking blocks is the most important gameplay element. Breaking a block causes the column of blocks above it to fall one place down. The player must use this block breaking ability to change the labyrinth and create a way to the princess. 

The short introduction sequence shows the back story: A beautiful princess fell in love with you! And you fell in love with her too... The wizard of forest "Popil" shut her in his labyrinth. Please save her!

		<name>Man Overboard!</name>
		<desc>Your name is Kevin Codner  rescue mariner extraordinaire, answering the distress call of a sinking cruise liner, the SS Lucifer. You set off in your little submarine and board the ship where a horde of passengers desperately need your keen oversight and "shipsmarts".

In 60 levels you have to rescue as many passengers (dubbed the Dim Passengers) as possible. At the beginning the passengers fall through a tube in the level. Similar to Lemmings you have to find a way for the passengers to the exit of the level. In order to do so, you must blast hindrances such cargo boxes and bulkheads with bombs or, when no bombs are left, reposition the boxes with a crane. There are also conveyor belts in the levels. If the belt moves in the wrong way, the passengers either can't use it or may even be transported to their dooms, being dropped off into water, fire or steam jets. You can usually choose the direction of the belts by pulling a lever.

There are several types of scenarios that Kevin Codner (you) are faced with throughout the game. Of course the puzzles get progressively more difficult, involving things like patching up cracked pipes to stop a lethal jet of steam from cooking the distressed passengers. You can blast away obstacles and stack crates in creative manners. For instance, you can have them fall onto each other to form a bridge across a gap or to provide shielding from fire. This is usually done by hoisting them onto conveyor belts using a crane.

Each level has a certain "save limit", meaning you have to save at least a certain amount of passengers. This again is akin a bit towards Lemmings, and lots of levels have a built-in time limit, represented be water pouring into the compartment, rising ominously. When the water rises high enough, the passengers will get carried along with it, and they can only swim for a short period of time before getting exhausted and drowning, so you'd better be on time with some assistance.

At the end of each level you receive a password (again, Lemmings-style) so that you may pick up your game from the current level without having to progress through them all from the get-go.</desc>

As he fell asleep, he woke up in the Kingdom of Beanwick, which is constantly tormented by earthquakes. Then, he offers his help to solve the mystery behind those earthquakes.

Mickey's Ultimate Challenge is a puzzle game in which the player chooses either Mickey or Minnie to play with. They'll find five characters from the Disney's universe in the kingdom, and will be prompted to help them in several tasks.

Each task is a different puzzle, given by a specific character. Daisy, for instance, will ask help to clean the castle's paintings hanging on a wall. The task is in fact a memory game, where Mickey or Minnie must clean the pictures matching pairs. After completing one task, they'll receive a gift.

After completing all tasks, Mickey or Minnie must trade the gifts they won with the right characters. For instance, after finishing Goofy's task, they will receive his hammer. The player must then guess who among the other characters would like to receive that hammer.

Giving the right items to the right characters will allow Mickey or Minnie access to the last puzzle and character.</desc>

		<name>Micro Machines</name>
		<desc>If you're bored of racing Formula 1 cars, rally cars or MotoGP bikes in their natural habitats, the Micro Machines series could be for you. It involves racing miniatures representing particular vehicle types across a particular terrain found around the house. The Sports Cars race on the desktop, 4x4s in the sandpit, Formula 1 cars on a snooker table, and so on.

These levels were packed with variation. The Snooker tables has the track painted on, although this is open to deviation (as are most levels), and had you racing through the pockets and across the rim of the table. Tanks raced as well, with the chance of shooting out your opponent if they got directly in front of you. The desktop levels include binders to jump across, pencil-sharpeners to avoid, and lots of visual jokes in the open homework.

Viewed from overhead with small graphics, the races include up to 4 cars. In one player challenge mode you race through the 21 tracks in a set order, selecting your 3 opponents as you go along (adding a fair amount of strategy - ideally you should aim to eliminate the better CPU cars early on), eliminating one after every third race (assuming that you can finish in the top 2 of a race within your 3 lives). If you win 3 races in a row without using a continue you get a time-trial race which can earn you an extra life.

The real innovation of the game was in the multiplayer modes. You started with 4 points each, and when one car gets far enough ahead to force the other car off-screen, the slider moves in their favour. Once it reached the end (which involved beating them 4 times more than they beat you) you win the level, although if 3 laps were completed, the person leading at that point is declared the winner - with a sudden death play off if scores are level. 9 of the tracks are available in this mode, although you can also play this Head to Head system as a 1-player game across all the tracks.

		<desc>The Mortal Kombat fighters, plus several new ones, return for a tournament held by the evil Shang Tsung of the Outworld. The action is one-on-one as before, and famed for its high level of violence and blood (other than the sanitised Nintendo version). There are 5 difficulty levels and optional credits, as well as the usual two player mode including same character duels.

To win the main tournament, the player must beat each of the other human players, before taking on Shang Tsung, Kintaro and finally Shao Kahn. Players have a range of punches and kicks available, as well as flying kicks, uppercuts, roundhouses, and the special moves, which vary for each player. These include throws, uppercuts, long-distance bullets, bicycle kicks and a teleport feature.

		<desc>Shao Kahn has won. The Earthrealm is no more. In order to revive his Queen Sindel, the emperor Shao Kahn used the Outworld Tournament from Mortal Kombat 2 as a diversion while his Shadow Priests revive his fallen Queen on Earth. Once enacted, the dimensional bridge between the two realms connects, allowing Kahn's extermination squads to invade and destroy Earth, and enslave the population's souls.

A small team of Raiden's "Chosen Warriors" survives the attack: Mortal Kombat champion Liu Kang and his ally Kung Lao, Special Forces agents Sonya Blade and Jax, the shaman Nightwolf, the riot cop Stryker, the nomadic Kabal, and former Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero, who has gone rogue from his clan. Facing the warriors are the mercenary Kano, cyber-ninjas Smoke, Sektor and Cyrax, Sheeva, a female Shokan, the sorcerer Shang Tsung, and Queen Sindel herself.

Mortal Kombat 3 brings new elements to the 2D fighting series: multi-level playfields, "Dial-A-Combo" attacks, a "Run" button to speed up the battles, and "Vs." codes, which unlock new powers and abilities once both players enter a code sequence in pre-match-up screens. Also included are more stage fatalities and finishing moves as each warrior attempts to go one-on-one with the Centaurian enforcer Motaro, and Shao Kahn himself.

Mortal Kombat 3 is the last traditional one-on-one fighting game game in the series to feature motion-captured digitized graphics for its kombatants, and introduces online network play to the PC version.</desc>

		<name>Mortal Kombat</name>
		<desc>Five Hundred years ago, an ancient and well respected Shaolin fighting tournament, held every 50 years, was corrupted by an evil and elderly sorcerer by the name of Shang Tsung.  Shang was accompanied by Prince Goro, a warrior of the Shokan race (a four armed half-human/half-dragon). Knowing that if ten tournaments in a row were won by the Outworld champion, the Earth Realm would be conquered by evil and fall into darkness, Shang entered Goro in the tournament and had him defeat the great Kung Lao. Goro has been  reigning supreme as the undefeated fighting champion for five hundred years now. As the last tournament required draws near, Raiden, Thunder God and protector of the Earth Realm, enacts a plan to tip the scales in the humans favor, Seven fighters step into the arena on Shang Tsung's mysterious island: Shaolin warrior Liu Kang, Special Forces operative Sonya Blade, the mercenary thug Kano, fame-seeking actor Johnny Cage, the ice wielding Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero and his undead adversary Scorpion, and Raiden himself.

Mortal Kombat is a side-scrolling 1 on 1 fighting game. Fighting is set as one on one kombat, allowing each player to perform a variety of punches, kicks, and special moves in order to defeat their opponent.  When the opponent faces their second round loss, the winner can perform a finishing move called a "Fatality" on the loser.  The Fatality is a move unique to each fighter that graphically kills the loser in a blood-soaked finale.

Mortal Kombat began its life as a 2-player arcade title. It is notable for its use of digitized actors to represent the game's fighters, as well as its use of copious amounts of blood during gameplay.</desc>

		<desc>In 1982, a sequel to the  incredibly popular Pac-Man was introduced in the form of his girlfriend, Ms. Pac-Man.  This sequel continued on the "eat the dots/avoid the ghosts" gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.

Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics.  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.

Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of "Junior".</desc>

		<name>NBA Jam : Tournament Edition</name>
		<desc>This game lets you play two-on-two arcade basketball with players from all the NBA teams. Gameplay is fast and action-packed, with few rules, no fouls, and deliberately unrealistic jamming. Players are rated on eight ability categories, from steals and blocks, to dunks and 3-pointers.

Up to four human players can take part, each always controlling a single player for their team, and AI for missing players. This allows for four players to face each other in teams of two, or for two players to team up against a third player with a CPU team-mate.

The Tournament Edition ups each team's roster to three players, and allows for substitutions between quarters. Shoving players now results in injuries, which lower a player's stats; encouraging you to sub them out and let them recover. Aside from the usual secret characters and cheat modes, the T.E. also includes four new additions you can individually enable from the special options menu:

1. "Hot Spots" are randomized zones on the court that reward extra points (up to a 9-point shot!) for making a basket while standing within them.

Powerup icons appear randomly, and convey temporary arcade-like benefits when picked up. Some examples are instant "on-fire," enhanced 3-point accuracy, monster dunks from anywhere on the court, or a bomb that knocks all other players to the ground.

"Juice Mode" increases the speed of the game up to 4x.

"Tournament Mode" disables all other modes, special characters, and cheats, and challenges you to defeat all the NBA teams to unlock extra players (2 extra players for almost every team). Winning Tournament Mode also unlocks a higher CPU difficulty level.

When Ryu learns of this, he embarks on a quest to find out who killed his father and why. This quest takes him to America to find an archaeologist with whom Ryu's father was working. From there, Ryu becomes embroiled in an evil, supernatural conspiracy involving a villain named Jaquio who has plans to use an ancient castle and some relics to unleash a terrifying evil upon the world.

Ninja Gaiden is a side scrolling game where Ryu the ninja can run, jump, and slash with his ninja sword. He can also attach to any vertical surface. Powerups are littered throughout the landscape that allow Ryu to toss fireballs and ninja stars, and perform other feats.

Ryu will battle through urban city settings, forests, jungles, snow covered castles, underground railroads, and ancient castles. A major feature in Ninja Gaiden are the cinematic scenes -- sometimes fullscreen -- through which the storyline unfolds.</desc>

		<name>Pac-Attack</name>
		<desc>Based on Namco's Japanese-only arcade puzzler Cosmo Gang the Puzzle, Pac-Attack is similar to many block-dropping puzzle games from the time, such as Puyo Puyo.

The objective of the game is to place ghosts and then, after three pieces (which can include one or two blocks as well), make Pac-Man eat as many ghosts as possible to try and clear up the game area. Pac-Man's directions are chosen at random between left or right, but as he goes moving on the game area (after you place him, of course), if he bumps against a block or a "wall" on the game area, he will change his direction. As with many block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of blocks and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game ends. However, by filling up a meter on the left of the game area, a fairy may appear that can clear approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but it only clears the ghosts, although the blocks that were on top of them will drop.

Also, like many puzzlers, it contains a versus mode against another human player. It's similar to the many versus modes of puzzle games: eat plenty of ghosts and your opponent will recieve many ghosts on his area.

The game also includes a Puzzle mode. It features 100 levels, in which you have to eat all ghosts with no more than 4 Pac-Men at least (the number reduces in certain levels), and, unlike the other modes, you can change Pac-Man's direction with the press of a button.

All of the handheld versions (including the one on Pac-Man Collection) lack the versus mode.</desc>

		<name>Pac-Man</name>
		<desc>One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.

Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde).  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.

Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze.  During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points.  This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.</desc>

The actions is viewed from the traditional third-person viewpoint. A tutorial mode is provided to help you get used to the forehand, lob and drop shots on offer. Several venues from all over the world can be played on, on Hard, Grass and Clay courts.

This was the first and one of the very few Genesis games to be released with a J-Cart, which meant that four-way gameplay was possible without the need of special adapters  the cartridge had two built-in joypad connectors. The Game Gear version was equally inventive, allowing two players to share one Game Gear, or four players to play doubles by linking two machines.</desc>

		<name>PGA Tour Golf II</name>
		<desc>A follow-up to PGA Tour Golf and a reduced version of it's Genesis counterpart where the player can choose play as a generic pro golfer or as an amateur and compete against four real-life pros including Fred Couples, Paul Azinger, Craig Stadler &amp; Fuzzy Zoeller with six different locations to choose from.  Players can choose to either play in Tournament mode, Skins Play or learn the basics of the game in Practice mode.  

Players use a cursor on a top-down view of a map to determine the location as well as another view from behind the golfer to avoid various obstacles such as trees.  After selecting their location they can then use a meter to the bottom left to determine how much draw or fade will be put into the shot.  To hit the ball, the players presses the "B" button to start the power meter and hitting it again to stop.

Players must also adjust to changing wind and weather conditions during game play which will drastically change the outcome of their shot.  It features four-player capabilities using Gear-to-Gear links as well as a password feature.</desc>

		<desc>PGA Tour Golf introduced many of the conventions commonly seen in the genre since. The three-click control method (the first to start the swing, the second setting power and over-swing, the third setting draw or fade) allowed for a multitude of different shots, and required a sense of timing. 

Four courses are included, one of them a fantasy 'links' course designed by the programmers. Some of the holes are fiendish, with bunkers, water hazards and trees, and the need to plan strategies to get the best approach to the green.

When playing a tournament there are 60 opponents, each representing top US golfers - ten of these appear with tactical advice for each hole.</desc>

		<desc>Ren and Stimpy just found a pair of hooves which belong to the great Shaven Yak, who lost them in the last Yak shaving day. Now they must find the Shaven Yak and return him his hooves, or there won't be any more Yak shaving days!

In this platform game the player is prompted to choose playing either as Ren or Stimpy at the start of new life or some stages. Both can jump and shoot (Ren shoots toothbrushes, Stimpy spits), but each one has his own special ability: Ren can perform high jumps, Stimpy can smash things jumping over them. Each character starts the game with three lives.

Throughout levels such as "The Blacker Than Black Forest", "The Stinking Dry Desert" or "The Stinking Wet Bayou", Ren and Stimpy will face most animal enemies, such as birds, frogs, vultures, woodpeckers, snakes, etc. The levels are divided in few or several sub-level, and at the end of each level, they'll face a boss.

They'll also find some unusual weapons, as a slice of bread (which flies in circles), a remote controller (which casts electric waves) and a soap bar (which casts bubbles). If they get hit when using a weapon, they'll lose it, but won't lose health. They'll gain health by picking items like TVs, cash bags, bottles and boots.

		<desc>Just when things were going great with Tom-Tom and his girlfriend Tanya, some thug of a woodland king had to kidnap her and hide her away, and Tom-Tom doesn't have a clue where. That's why he has to explore deep dark forests, cross endless oceans, climb treacherous slopes, survive endless volcanoes, and even walk through clouds. But Tom-Tom will never be totally alone. You see, when he goes through the exotic locations, he has to come face to face with its inhabitants, like bees, spiders, snakes, coal-kids, frogs, bats, snails, coyotes, and octopuses, to name a few. The hatchet is Tom-Tom's only line of defense against these menaces.

There are ten areas, each containing four rounds each, but the tenth area can't be accessed unless Tom-Tom collects all the dolls during his rescue mission. During his journey, he can break open different eggs that will reveal hatchets, skateboards, mushrooms, milk, and even guardian angels. You can ride the skateboard through each round, as long as you don't collide with an inhabitant. When you complete each round while still riding the skateboard, you'll start the next round still riding it. As you progress through each round, your vitality will start to get low, but it can be increased by getting milk, mushrooms, potato chips,or fruit that appear everywhere you go. As well as the normal eggs, there are also speckled eggs that must be avoided, otherwise the God of Death will be released, and once he follows you, you'll lose vitality much quickly. At the end of every fourth round, there is a king waiting to destroy you with his fireballs or lightning bolts.

There are also warp-gates, but you don't find them, they find you. You see, warp-gates appear in rounds 1-4 of each area. If you happen to get one fruit, a special item will appear. These special items include handbags, wrist watches, a pair of shoes, a teddy bear, and a bottle of perfume. Another girl will appear and take you up to the clouds where the object is to collect as many hearts as you can without falling down or getting the item again. Once you have collected all the hearts, you can get the item to return to the surface, and more often than not, you'll get further in the round.</desc>

The game is practically a copy of Evander Holyfield's Real Deal Boxing, save for the graphics style and the included fighters.</desc>

		<path>./Road Rash (USA).7z</path>
		<name>Road Rash</name>
		<desc>Road Rash is an aggressive motorcycle racing game where the player assumes the role of a biker who takes part in a series of illegal races across the U.S.A. Starting at the back of the pack the objective is always to finish first on a linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved by driving very well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs, crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows.

By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you're knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage. When the player crashes with cops nearby, it is possible to get busted and then you have to forfeit the race.

Like the whole Road Rash lineage, the game has arcade-like gameplay with no intention to be a motorcycle simulation. While the game has a two-player mode, this is not simultaneous.</desc>

The teams are updated, with the sides present in the 92-93 European tournaments included, and the player names updated to take transfers into account. 

The game was tidied up and changed in a number of areas. The most significant change is the addition of red and yellow cards for discipline (2 yellow card offenses or one professional foul (denying your opponent a clear goal-scoring opportunity) results in that player being sent off). The goalkeepers have been improved in skill, and the 1994 World Cup Qualifying tournament was added.

		<desc>This is not a sequel to the game  Shining Force: The Legacy of Great Intention for Genesis, but a sequel to a  Shining Force Gaiden, which was released only in Japan.

After a prolonged war, the kingdoms of Cypress and Gardiana decided to join forces fighting the evil empire of Iom. Nick, the Prince of Cypress, that was conquered by Iom, had his hand turned into stone during the last battle, and therefore cannot wield his legendary Sword of Hajya. Nevertheless, he tries to recruit people who would help him to gain his kingdom back.

The game is a strategy RPG. You command a large party composed of several units, and most of the game is spent in battles. The turn-based battles occupy the entire location; during your turn, you command your troops to move around and to attack. Your main heroes gain levels in a RPG fashion.

Another new thing is that the gadgets touched while racing do not come into effect immediately. They need to be triggered manually by pressing up on the D-pad.

There are 3 GPs to compete in and each GP has 6 tracks. The names of the GPs are:

2. White Chaos GP
3. Blue Chaos GP

Racing skills can be improved in the Free Run mode on any of the tracks, or, with a Gear-to-Gear cable and a spare copy of the game, direct competition against another human player in the versus mode.</desc>

The player can choose to play as Sonic or Tails (who can fly), and you're trying to reach the Chaos Emeralds before anyone else. A change from other Sonic games is that when hit, all rings are not lost, only a set amount (3050 depending on the level) is lost.

"Dear Sonic,

Robotnik is back, and he's captured all the animals on the island! He is holding me in a place called the Crystal Egg. In order to free me, you have to find and bring the six Chaos Emeralds.

Robotnik made me write this. He says he's waiting for you, and he's created six really nasty robots in order to 'get rid of you once and for all.' I don't know what he has planned, but Sonic, please be careful!

Sincerely, Tails."

That being more that enough motivation for him, Sonic races out to defeat Robotnik again.

The master system version is totally different than the Sonic 2 for Genesis. Tails obviously doesn't accompany you, like he can in the Genesis release. Sonic can also not do his infamous buzzsaw roll by simply ducking and pressing jump.</desc>

		<name>Sonic the Hedgehog</name>
		<desc>SEGA's mascot Sonic the Hedgehog made his debut in a famous Genesis title, but Sega's 8-bit systems got their own version of the platformer, featuring the same story and gameplay style, but different levels.

To stop the evil Dr. Robotnik, Sonic must traverse six zones consisting of three levels each. Most of the zones are based on those in the original game, but some are entirely new. Enemies (mechanized animals, defeated by Sonic's spikes when jumping or rolling) and power-ups (speed-ups, shields, extra lives) are mostly the same as well. Sonic can pick up golden rings for protection (when hit, he simply loses all of his rings instead of a life) and bonuses: 100 rings gain Sonic an extra life, and 50 remaining rings at the end of a level allow access to pinball-themed special stages full of bumpers and springs. The final level of a zone is always a boss fight against Robotnik.

Sonic should also collect the six Chaos Emeralds to keep them from falling into Robotnik's hands. In a departure from the original game, these are not hidden in the special stages but somewhere in the regular levels.</desc>

		<desc>From the ingame intro:

"Doctor Octopus is plotting the crowning caper of his criminal career... to rule the world.
He has reunited the Sinister Six and with these super-villains together again, nothing stands in their way - except Spider-Man!"

Spider-Man: Return of the Sinister Six is a side-scrolling game which puts you in the role of Spidey throughout six levels against Electro, Sandman, Mysterio, Vulture, Hobgoblin and Doctor Octopus respectively. Some puzzle solving (like finding a key) is necessary to beat some levels. Spidey can duck jump, climb walls, punch, shoot webs to swing (by pressing punch and jump together) and perform a jump kick (by pressing the punch button twice). Collecting web cartridges allows Spidey to shoot limited web projectiles.

Although hard to die, Spidey has only one life, there are no items to recharge life (but killing some guys will do so) and only one continue.

		<path>./Star Trek Generations - Beyond the Nexus (USA, Europe).7z</path>
		<name>Star Trek : Generations : Beyond the Nexus</name>
		<desc>Beyond the Nexus is based on the seventh Star Trek movie and its story: Captains Kirk and Picard must team up to stop a mad scientist from destroying an inhabited planet so that he might reenter the mysterious Nexus energy ribbon.

The game has several different playing modes. The first is starship combat: seen from the main screen of the Enterprise (both the -B or the -D version) you navigate the ship through space, firing phasers or photon torpedoes at enemies like Tholians, Klingons and Romulans. Another mode has you navigating the ship to its destination by flying through rectangles in space.

On away missions, the view switches to a top-down perspective where you control a single character and can fire your phaser at enemies.

Finally, the game has two puzzle modes. In the first one, frequencies must be decoded: this is done by putting symbols into the right order. One can only guess the order at first, but after an attempt the game reveals how many of the selected symbols are part of the combination and how many are in the right place. Using logic, the right order can be determined, but there are only a limited number of tries.

The second puzzle mode is used to reroute power from one system to another. To do so, a path must be built on a grid for the energy to flow through. The path must be built out of randomly assigned pieces that don't always fit together, similar to the concept of Pipe Mania.

		<path>./Stargate (World).7z</path>
		<name>Stargate</name>
		<desc>The handheld version of Stargate is a matching puzzle game, similar to a 3-D  Tetris. Players drop tiles into a Stargate, and try to stack three identical symbols. Doing so clears those tiles. Mismatched tiles simply build stacks higher and higher, and the player loses if the tiles reach the top of the gate. The player is also given a seven-symbol Stargate "address" along the top of the screen. Stacking three copies of a symbol listed in the address will clear the stack and counts toward completing the address.

There are two game modes building on this basic concept:

1. Skill Mode is a single-player challenge where the player tries to complete as many addresses as they can before being overwhelmed. Speed increases with completed addresses.

Battle Mode can be played against the computer, or against a second player connected with a link cable. In Battle Mode, any stacks you clear are sent through the Stargate and appear on your opponent's side. A height level meter is added on the sides to show how close you and your opponent are to overflowing their gates. You can win by outlasting your opponent (while sending complete stacks through to make things more difficult for them) or by being the first to complete the address.</desc>

One year later, after their reunion, Adam's brother Sammy returned from school to find their apartment in a mess, and Adam nowhere to be seen, and after calling his two friends, one of them notices a photo of Adam chained to a wall, next to someone they knew very well - Mr. X, who returned to turn the peaceful city once again into a war zone. Now, Axel, Blaze, Sammy, and Axel's good friend Max, a pro wrestler, must head out to stop Mr. X once again...hopefully for good...

Streets of Rage 2 differs from the previous title in several ways. There are changes in both graphics (characters now are bigger, more detailed and with more animation frames, and scenarios are less grainy) and gameplay (the rocket move was replaced by a special move that doubles in offense and defense along several new moves), along other new features such as life bars (and names) for all enemies and the radically different new characters.</desc>

		<desc>Streets of Rage, Sega's answer to Final Fight, follows the story of three young police officers (Adam Hunter, Axel Stone and Blaze Fielding) in a city controlled by a criminal syndicate led by a "Mr. X" where crime is rampant, which leads the three heroes to make a pact to leave the force and topple the syndicate by themselves.

Gameplay is straightforward and simple. Three buttons are used, one to jump, other to attack and another to perform a range attack from a support police car. Each character has a limited set of moves that include punching and kicking or performing a back attack (if in the open), two grapple moves (depending if holding the opponent in front or by the back), a flying attack, and if playing with another player two additional tag attacks, and different abilities: Adam is slow, but a good jumper and a hard hitter, Axel fast and also a hard hitter, but a lousy jumper and Blaze fast and a good jumper, but weak hitter.
Levels are in typical arcade side-scroller fashion: move from left to right (with two exceptions), clearing screens from enemies one after another as fast as possible while avoid taking damage with a boss in the end. Some levels feature "death drops" where the player must avoid falling, while throwing enemies there at the same time, including a typical elevator level.  Several items are scattered on the ground, from melee weapons and bonus points (and lives or additional police cars) to apples and turkeys (to restore health).</desc>

The gameplay is similar to the original, consisting of running, jumping and attacking, with a very dynamic central character. The laser gun can be used while standing still; moving attacks with the sword are still possible, with the two weapons combining similarly to the Switchblade games. Tokens can be collected, which will turn you into a robot to face the end-of-level enemies if enough are collected.

Super Battletank: War in the Gulf is a 1st person tank simulation. Players sit in the cockpit to of a M1 Abrams tank. Controls allow the player to accelerate forward, decelerate, rotate the tank's trajectory left and right, move the tank's cannon left and right, fire the weapon and check the map. The goal of the player is to travel to the location of enemy targets, line them up with the Abrams cannon and fire upon them until destroyed. Each mission covers a large area of land and the player will need to consult the real-time map to travel appropriately to target locations. The M1 Abrams tank also features 2 special weapons: The laser which is more powerful than regular cannon, and the smoke screen which allows the player to escape.</desc>

The world's most popular television show is Smash T.V., an ultra-violent contest between two armed-to-the-teeth combatants, set loose in a series of deadly arenas that are filled to bursting with hordes of mindless beasts and killer robots. The aim of the game is to blast everything in sight and try to grab more cash and prizes than the other guy. Toaster ovens, VCRs, fancy cars and luxury holidays are there for the taking... for anyone who can survive long enough to enjoy them.

Smash T.V. is an insane shoot-em-up from the brain of Eugene Jarvis, creator of Robotron: 2084. It retains that game's frantic style of play and two-joystick control method, but adds plenty of gore, violence, a hint of satire and that all-important two player mode.</desc>

The entire introduction of how the surfers discover they are the sons of a Patusani king is not mentioned and instead the player is thrown in the story as a ninja trainee right away. Colonel Chi wants to overthrow the kingdom and kill the last heirs, so he sends troops of ninjas to kill the two brothers.

Players control one of the brothers as he travels through different locations such as the Palace restaurant, the docks at Venice (California), the island of Patu San and more. The 2D side-scrolling platforms missions contains platforms, enemies and ninjas and various hazards. One button is used to jump while the other, in combination with the D-pad, launches punches, kicks, throws and various combos. Attacks can also be performed from the air or using very high jumps.

During gameplay an options screen can be accessed to review the statistics (health, strength, reflex and fight), get a hint through Adam's Game Gear, call the ninja Zatch to launch a powerful attack or select a weapon such as shurikens, fireballs, a knife and a sword.

		<name>T2 : The Arcade Game</name>
		<desc>As the title states, this is the home conversion of the arcade rail-shooter based on the film Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Up to two players shoot through future and present levels as robotic killers reprogrammed to serve the human resistance. 

Both players wield a machine gun with infinite ammo that lowers its firing rate (overheats) as it is continuously fired. A secondary weapon (missile launchers in the future, shotguns in the present) has limited ammo but deals heavy damage. Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and coolant for the machine guns, and are shot to be collected.

T2: The Arcade Game features seven levels based on specific scenes or general concepts in the film. The first four levels act as a prelude, as the player guns down waves of metal Terminators across a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a besieged Human Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of the enemy supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying the computer, players travel back in time to protect John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet research at the headquarters of its manufacturer. From there, players must fend off the indestructible T-1000 until the final showdown in the Steel Mill.

Assets from the movie are used when possible, such as voice clips from Arnold Schwarzenegger, and close-up digital stills of Robert Patrick for the final battle against the T-1000. The Genesis and SNES versions also support lightguns (the Menacer and Super Scope, respectively).

You play a crash test dummy, trying to progress through levels filled with hazards such as cars and fireballs, within the time limits. Contact with each of these loses you a limb, and once you have none left, contact means game over. Since the character isnt handicapped by missing limbs in any way, in practical terms you can think of these as hit points  especially as there are screwdrivers to pick up which restore one limb.</desc>

		<name>The Jungle Book</name>
		<desc>This 8-bit adaptation of Disney's 1967 animated film Jungle Book is slightly different from the other versions. Although most of the main elements remain the same, the most noticeable differences are in level design and some missing items.

The player controls Mowgli in his journey to the human village. Mowgli will swing on and climb vines, run and jump while facing enemies such as coconut-throwing monkeys, snakes and vampire bats. To fight them, Mowgli can throw bananas in eight directions. He'll also find upgrades and weapons such as boomerangs inside banana bunches. There are some boss fights with main characters of the movie, such as the snake Kaa.

The objective of each of the 10 time-limited levels (or "scenes") is to collect gems scattered around them. Collecting certain amounts of gems grant access to bonus levels. The player starts the game with 4 lives and 1 continue.

		<path>./Ottifants, The (Europe) (En,Fr,De,Es,It).7z</path>
		<name>The Ottifants</name>
		<desc>Bruno is a baby Ottifant. It's an ordinary evening, and Bruno's dad is working late at office. Reason enough for Bruno's vivid imagination to run riot, thinking that his dad has been kidnapped by aliens! Jelly babies, that fell from his father's pocket on the way to work, blaze a trail to the office. Now it's up to Bruno to fight his way through hordes of terrorizing toys, Ottifant-eating plants, tear through gloomy caverns of doom and cut across a perilous jungle - workaday objects and boringly normal settings as seen through kids' eyes - and rescue his dad!

The Ottifants for the SEGA Game Gear is a 2D side-scrolling platformer where the player controls Bruno through five worlds: starting with the house and the basement, through to the building site, the office and finally the jungle, whereas each world is in turn divided into three stages. Bruno's primary weapon is his trunk, which gives him the ability to blast enemies by firing sweets at them, or suck in objects like out-of-reach platforms or boxes by holding down the Fire-button. Furthermore, yellow, green and red lollies are spread throughout the stages. Gathering three of them activate one of Bruno's special skills and can - depending on the colour combination - transform the baby Ottifant into Superfant with the ability to fly, boost his speed with Speedy Shoes, give an extra Continue and more. 

Picking up jelly babies, blasting enemies and collecting papers gives points and raises Bruno's score up to a fixed value of 9,999 pts. There are several entrances to secret rooms hidden in the five worlds. But, unlike the Genesis-version, the rooms are quite small and basic and there is no 1,000 point reward by completing them. On the whole there are two different tunes backing your journey through the game: one for the stages and one for the boss enemies. The varied background music and sound effects of the Genesis-game are completely missing, as is one entire world: The Garden.</desc>

		<path>./Ultimate Soccer (Japan, Europe) (En,Fr,De,Es,It).7z</path>
		<name>Ultimate Soccer</name>
		<desc>Ultimate Soccer is a football (European) game composed by 64 (unlicensed) international teams, each with it's own values for running, ball control and strength. There are five game modes (friendly, penalty shootout, tournament, playoff and league), but the lack of password or built-in battery means each one of them must be completed in one sitting.

The gameplay can be tweaked for the players' preference by changing several key aspects of the physics engine, such as wind strength and direction, ball weight (lighter balls travel higher, faster  and farther but are more prone to be deflected by winds than heavy balls, who barely lift of the ground and are slowed down by wet grass), tightness of ball control and players speed and momentum. A five-a-side mode, where the ball is never out of play is also included. Thanks to the many options regarding the physics, the game allows a lot of flexibility in playmaking, from building up the play with small passes from the midfield to belting the ball upwards in hope of a goalmouth deflection.

Graphically, the game is similar to EA's Madden NFL series, with pseudo-3D effects allowing the view to be tilted up to show more detail up front or tilted down to show more of the field. 

The series later continued with Striker on the same console and Striker' 96 on PC, Saturn and PlayStation.</desc>

		<name>Virtua Fighter Animation</name>
		<desc>Virtua Fighter Animation is an one-on-one 2D fighting game based on the Virtua Fighter anime series. It has two game modes: story and versus.

In the story mode, the player follows the anime's plot, with anime style cutscenes before and after each fight. The story is divided in acts, each one of them corresponding to one fight. The player starts controlling Akira Yuki, as as he beats his opponents, each one of them joins his party, so they can be chosen in the next fights. Besides Akira, the other characters which become available are Pai Chan, Jacky Bryant, Wolf Hawkfield, Kage-Maru, Sarah Bryant and Lau Chan. In the final act, the player must fight against Dural.

The versus mode allows players to choose any of the seven available characters to fight against the CPU. In the two player versus game, Kage-Maru is removed from the character selection.

The Game Gear version has 3 different viewing modes: Normal, Large and Real-Time. The Normal viewing mode shows the fighters from a more distant position (smaller sprites) than the Large mode (larger sprites). The Real-Time mode simulates the zooming camera effects from the other Virtua Fighter games, alternating between the Normal and Large modes. It also has an extended intro sequence, with anime style cutscenes.

In regards to gameplay, the game doesn't differ much from any other 2D fighting game, as the player can perform punches (button 1), kicks (button 2) and jumps (up), as well as some special maneuvers. The Game Gear version has also a block function (START button), absent in the Master System version. The fights are regular best of 3 round matches, and players will loose a round if one of this three possibilities happen: their energy is depleted, they fall out of the ring or they have less energy than the opponent if the time runs out.</desc>

		<desc>Wheel of Fortune: featuring Vanna White is one of a series games based on the famous TV game show. The goal is to solve a word puzzle by guessing letters. The players take turns spinning a wheel that has designated money amounts in most spaces, but can also bankrupt the player in the wheel lands on the wrong space. A player can guess a letter and if that letter is in the puzzle, those spaces are flipped to reveal the letter and the player earns the cash amount specified by the wheel spin, multiplied by the number of occurrences of the letter. Only English consonants can be guessed-- the 5 English vowels can be purchased using a player's earnings.

This NES edition of the game allows 1, 2, or 3 human players to play against each other. Human players can also elect to play against computer players and at 3 difficulty levels. 

The Vanna White Edition differs from previous Wheel of Fortune games on the NES in that it actually bears the likeness of Vanna White. Also, there are avatars for the player contestants, and the wheel animation is different.

		<desc>Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap is a direct sequel to Wonder Boy in Monster Land. When Tom-Tom defeats the MEKA dragon, the wounded beast casts a spell on him, turning him into a Lizard-Man. To regain your original human form, you have to find the Salamander Cross, hidden by the Vampire Dragon in Monster Land.

In this side-scrolling platform game, you can still buy equipment and items, but unlike its predecessor, it is not divided in sequences of levels. You are allowed to go anywhere, as long as you have the right shape or equipment. During his quest, Tom-Tom has to defeat various dragon bosses. Each win will give you a new shape with new abilities such as flying, swimming, walking on ceilings or clinging to walls, which also give you to access new parts of the world. The possible shapes are Lizard-Man, Mouse-Man, Piranha-Man, Lion-Man and Hawk-Man and the main abilities are defined by attacking power, defense points and charm points (needed for equipment by collecting charm stones). Also, certain blocks can only be destroyed by specific weapons or are only accessible to certain shapes.

The basic actions consist of attacking and jumping, and in the status screen you can equip swords, shields and armour. Special attacks include fire balls, tornadoes, arrows, boomerangs and thunder strikes. Along the way, you collect keys (only one at all times) and gold left behind by defeated creatures, and you often have to revisit places to access new areas. A password is given at the beginning of each town to continue from there.

		<name>Woody Pop</name>
		<desc>Every system must have a Breakout clone, and every self-respecting developer must have one, especially in the mid-eighties, following the success of Taito's Arkanoid. Sega's answer was called Woody Pop.

With a wooden paddle, which in fact is Woody the tree spirit, you bounce your ball against bricks laid out in a big house filled with toys. The toys will come out to disturb you. When you hit "mystery bricks", wind-up toy soldiers or robots come out, obstructing your ball. On some levels, a toy train will cross your path as well. Speaking of wells, the bottom of the screen is not a big black hole as in most other games of this kind  instead the whole covers only a part of the wall, so that even if you miss the ball, it might bounce back in the corners.

Once a room is cleared, you can choose freely between up to three adjacent rooms to progress to, making this game less linear than usual.

Like any post-Arkanoid game, there is a range of powerups released from special blocks. Most are known from other games such as the double-ball, the growing bat or the "diamond ball", which destroys all blocks in its path without ricocheting. Some invented by Sega are the fire ball, which sets blocks on fire, allowing them to destroy even neighbouring blocks, and the big ball, which hits bricks with more power, thereby destroying brick with one hit that would otherwise have required several.</desc>

A course editor is provided.  The courses provided include real courses like St. Andrews, a fictional designs such as The Gauntlet, which as the name suggests is designed to push your skills to the maximum.

The PC version revolutionized the use of the PC speaker to reproduce voice samples via their patented "RealSound" process. Quips like "No doubt about it, he's deep in the sandtrap", "Straight onto the fairway", and "Looks like he hit the tree, Jim." are used to provide running commentary on the gameplay.</desc>

		<desc>The continent of Tyramus has lived in peace for almost a century, thanks to the four elemental crystals of the kingdom of Arliel. However, peace is threatened by the invading armies of the Jyn Empire, led by Emperor Grym, who wants to use the four crystals to rule over Tyramus. Fortunately, Princess Iris can escape with one of the crystals and now the player has to protect her and the crystal and somehow find a way to drive back the hordes of Jyn.

Gameplay in Crystal Warriors is quite similar to Shining Force. The player fights in turn-based battles controlling different characters like fighters, healers, rangers and mages, all with different strengths and skills. Whenever two units engage in battle, they enter a duel mode lasting for up to two turns. In this mode the player can choose between four commands: "battle" (attack), "retreat", "spell" and "monster". While the first three commands are quite self-explanatory, the "monster" command is interesting. Whenever a non-human enemy is defeated, it can be tamed and be used in battles. While most monsters do not have many HP they can serve as good attackers for physically weak characters or take some hits in order to protect his master.
In-between battles the player can visit towns to rest, buy weapons and spells or recruit new party members.</desc>

Try to escape from the dungeon, take out Jaffar's guards, find your way through the Sultan's palace and defeat Jaffar himself. Now go, you've got 60 minutes!

Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer with run and jump gameplay. Your hero must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple puzzles and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. An especially noteworthy aspect of the game is the very fluent animation of your character.

The Game Boy Color and SNES versions of the game feature additional levels and new enemies. The Genesis version has a new intro and an altered set of graphics but the level layout remains almost identical to that of the original.</desc>

		<desc>In a dark future, Mojo has his own TV show where the participants fight to death. He has imprisoned some X-Men from the past to recreate their greatest battles. Wolverine and Rogue have to enter the game and rescue their friends, then defeating Mojo to return back home. 

In this platform game, the player starts choosing either Wolverine or Rogue. At each new level beaten, a new X-Men will be available: first Gambit, then Cyclops, Havoc and finally Shard. If one of the X-Men dies, the player has to start the level again, choosing among the remaining X-Men the one to play. After all the X-Men have died, the game is over.

Each character can activate his/her power at will. Wolverine can use his claws, Rogue can fly, Gambit can throw explosive cards, Cyclops will fire optic blasts, Havoc fires plasma blasts and Shard fires energy blasts. The characters have an energy meter and a power meter, which will worn out as they are hit or use their powers, respectively. They can find items to restore their energy and power.

Gameplay consists basically in finding the way out of each of the six levels. Once finding it, the character will face a boss, usually known characters from the comics like Magneto, Fitzroy, a Sentinel, etc. The last boss is Mojo himself.

		<desc>Bart vs. The Space Mutants is a platform game where the player goes into the role of Bart Simpson (from the TV show The Simpsons) and must stop the Space Mutants from invading Springfield.

On each of the five levels, Bart must collect (or get rid of) the ingredients that the Space Mutants are planning to use to build their machine, such as purple objects or balloons. He also has to collect enough "proof" of the aliens existence (brown coins left behind when they are jumped on), so his family members will help him when he meets a boss (characters such as Nelson and Sideshow Bob). This won't be easy since the Space Mutants are "using" human bodies as disguise. In order to discover who are the real Space Mutants, Bart must use his X-ray Specs.

The ways Bart can get rid of those objects sought by the Space Mutants are numerous. For instance, in the first stage, Bart must get rid of purple objects. He can dye them red, cover them, wash them, etc. Some even involve a little puzzle solving, like playing a trick on Moe to make him get out of the bar.

Bart also has some coins that can be used in many ways throughout the game, like buying things, getting devices operating, etc. Those coins are essential to solve some puzzles in the game.

Following the fight at the top of the Statue of Liberty that ended the film, the game continues on with levels and characters inspired by the comic book culminating with a battle against the Dark Judges on Deadworld.</desc>

		<desc>Before Tails met Sonic the Hedgehog he lived on Cocoa Island, a place that isn't on the map. It's an island pulled up by the Chaos Emeralds. Suddenly, while relaxing, Tails hears an explosion that seems like it's coming from inside the island. A Flicky tells Tails that Battle Kukku has invaded the island. He also tells Tails that Battle Kukku is mining here for the Chaos Emeralds, to obtain it's power. Tails gears up and heads for his quest to find the machine parts to build his weapon to defeat the evil Battle Kukku. There are however major plot differences between the Japanese and the western release. In the US and European version of the game it tells the story how Sonic and Tails decide to go separate ways for a while. Tails finds an unknown island and decides to dub it Tails Island. While resting there, a large explosion occurs and a Flicky tells him birds are invading the island.

Unlike the other games in the series, this spin-off is less of a traditional platformer, but has a much slower pace with rpg elements and a focus on puzzle-solving. Tails can walk, jump, fly (momentarily), hang on ledges and throw bombs. He starts with ten health points that can be replenished with rings, but the amount can be extended to 99 by collecting chaos emeralds. In the twelve stages Tails can collect up to 26 items. Per level however, he is only allowed to bring along four and this adds a tactical dimension. One of the most vital tools is the Remote Robot that can squeeze through small areas that Tails cannot reach. Underwater he changes into the small submarine Sea Fox.</desc>

		<name>Predator 2</name>
		<desc>Predator 2 is similar to its 16-bit counterpart. The player controls Lt. Mike Harrigan in a side scrolling view (instead of an isometric one) through 7 levels.

Mike has to fight drug dealers and must rescue a certain number of hostages at each level. The Predator's three-dotted laser aim is a menace to avoid, which can kill either the hostages or Mike himself. Gang members killed drop drugs which can be picked up for points (and sent to the drugs squad). At the end of each level a boss must be defeated.

Mike can move and shoot in all 8 directions, but can only stop and shoot up, down, left and right. Besides his pistol, Mike can also collect new weapons such as grenades, shotguns, machine-guns and rifles. Body armor can be collected for health and med kits for extra lives.</desc>

		<path>./X-Men (USA).7z</path>
		<name>X-Men</name>
		<desc>X-Men is a sidescrolling beat'em up/platform game, much like its homonymous Mega Drive/ Genesis counterpart. Several X-Men characters are playable throughout the game. The player can choose from two characters from the start, Cyclops and Wolverine, and three Levels are accessible. In the course of the game, the player can unlock five other X-Men, namely Storm, Iceman, Rogue, Nightcrawler and Psylocke.

The story is that most of the X-Men have been kidnapped by Magneto, which is the reason why only Cyclops and Wolverine are available from the start. Apparently, unlocking the characters equals rescuing him. On the way, there several foes from the X-Men universe to beat, and at the end, Magneto once again needs a reprehension.

The basic mechanics of the game are punching, (double-)jumping and jump-kicking. Furthermore, pressing Start activates/ deactivates the characters mutant ability, for example Wolverine's claws or Cyclops' laser beams. Using it however drains a limited amount of energy, which can be refreshed by finding "X"-symbols.</desc>

		<desc>In Aerial Assault, you play the Freedom Fighter who must destroy five targets, including the Vinsk, CB-53 Bomber, "El", and two cliff fortresses. During each of the five missions, you will encounter enemy jets, choppers, submarines, jeeps, parachute bombs, and several other enemies in which you must destroy. Shooting either the spinning fighters or the small flying helicopters will earn you a power-up that allows you to upgrade or downgrade your firepower. There are three difficult settings: "Easy", "Normal", and "Hard". You will not be able to complete the game if you select the "Easy" setting.</desc>

		<path>./Aladdin (USA, Europe).7z</path>
		<name>Aladdin</name>
		<desc>Sega's 8-bit systems received a unique adaptation of Disney's 1992 animated film Aladdin.

Like other versions, it is a side-scrolling action game. The player controls Aladdin, making his way through a variety of locations, including the streets of Agrabah, the Cave of Wonders, the Sultan's palace and more. Gameplay takes several different forms: some levels are chases, where Aladdin runs automatically, but must be made to jump over chasms or rolling rocks and barrels, evade falling objects and avoid getting caught by a guard. Other levels are platforming affairs: Aladdin must run, jump and climb, find keys or switches to open doors while searching for the exit. Rocks can be collected and be thrown to dispatch enemies or hit buttons otherwise out of reach. Finally, there are also several magic carpet rides in the game, in which the level scrolls automatically and the player must make sure to avoid any obstacles in the way.
