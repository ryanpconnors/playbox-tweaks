		<name>Bejeweled Twist</name>
		<desc>Bejeweled Twist is a tile matching game, where the player rotates groups of four jewels to create rows and columns of three or more matching gems. In the Classic and Zen modes, the objective is to make enough matches to fill a tube at the left side of the screen to move to the next level. There's a chain meter at the top of this tube, that builds up with matches in a row multiplying the points, and making a fruit jewel appear when full. A box at the tube bottom shows the sequence of matches needed for bonus points.

Obstacles appear randomly on the game board. The coal can't be matched, but it can be exploded by one of the power-ups gems. The locked jewel is chained to its place and can't move, but it can be removed with a match. Bomb gems display the number of moves allowed before they explode, destroying the board and ending the game. They have to be matched before their counters reach zero, otherwise a revolving wheel-of-fortune appears that stops in one of two values, skulls or gems, that either detonate or disarm the bomb. This mini-game becomes more difficult every time it comes up.

The power-ups appear after making matches of four or more gems. A four jewel match creates the flame gem, that explodes when matched removing all surrounding jewels. A five jewel match creates the lightning gem, that destroys a column and a row at the same time in a cross of fire.

With the exception of Classic Mode , the other modes are unlocked with continuous playing. Zen Mode is similar to Classic, but is more relaxed without the bomb and locked jewels. Challenge Mode is a puzzle mode, where the objective is to perform a task, like removing all gems of one color, or making a number of matches in a row. In Blitz Mode, the goal is to accumulate the maximum amount of points possible within a time limit.</desc>

		<name>Bubble Bobble Double Shot</name>
		<desc>Bubble-blowing dragons Bub and Bob return (now with buddy Bubu in tow) for a more traditional 2D platform romp than earlier DS title Bubble Bobble Revolution, still however retaining some of its gameplay innovations.

The basic gameplay is as has lasted the test of time: expelling bubbles from their mouths, the adorable dragons first incapacitate monsters by enveloping them in bubbles, then put them out of commission by popping the containing bubble (replacing the enemy with a tasty piece of fruit!) -- each level ending with every enemy popped, through ten worlds of ten levels each with a boss fight at the end of each world.  A trapped monster, if left unpopped, will eventually free itself, now red, angry, fast and aggressive, and if it takes too long for the dragons to clean up a level, the notorious invincible ghost whale "Baron von Blubba" appears to turn up the heat.

Things escalate in complexity quite quickly, however, considering that each dragon blows a different colour of bubble -- and that some enemies (designated by colour-coded stars) can only be trapped by certain-coloured bubbles.  (Complicating things further, some enemies need to be trapped by combinations of two differently-coloured bubbles before they're down for the count.  These elements remain even in single-player mode, where the player has the option of toggling their colour mid-game to produce the necessary bubble colour.)

An array of traditional power-ups (shot distance, movement speed, etc.), weapons (lightning bolts, floods and firebombs) and bonuses (freeze enemies, invincibility, flood level, etc.) remain in effect, as does the longstanding E-X-T-E-N-D bonus mechanism -- here regulated (among other effects) through subtle machinations of the new star bubble type.

When player lives are expended, the option of continuing is granted according to player performance in mini-games making use of the DS touchscreen and stylus, ramping up in difficulty through every continue used.</desc>

		<desc>What begins as a carefree day at the Millennial Fair for a young man named Crono turns into his ultimate adventure. When Crono meets a young girl named Marle, little does he realize that this young girl, his best friend Lucca's invention, and a mysterious pendant will thrust him into the ultimate trip through time and space, encountering new friends, defeating the forces of evil, and encountering the one who would destroy the flow of time.

Chrono Trigger is a role-playing game, with the usual game mechanics fare for such: the player takes control of a variably large party, developing the combat skills of its members and managing their equipment. As the characters grow in power, not only their ability scores increase, but they also learn new "Techs" - special powerful attacks and maneuvers which cost them "Magic Points" to use in battle. 

The game utilizes the ATB (active time battle) combat system from  Final Fantasy games - sort of a mix of turn-based and real-time combat -  adding to it combo attacks. Apart from normal Techs, it is possible to use Double and Triple Techniques - super-powerful attacks which involve two or three characters using their abilities at once. There are no random battles in the game, as all the enemies are visible on screen, and it's even possible to just pass by them entirely. 

The game allows you to face your ultimate adversary at different points of time, which leads to several different endings. There is also a New Game+ option, which allows you to carry over your powerful characters to a new game, and adds even more endings to the already existing ones.</desc>

He and his assistant, Terry, have crash-landed on an unknown island, and the professor needs to make repairs to his ship.  Subtly guide Terry around the island (and later on, the world!) to help them both.

Contact is an adventure game with a difference.  The professor from the game is aware of your presence, but his assistant, Terry, is not.  You indirectly control Terry by moving him around the game world and issue commands to him.  Every action that Terry makes has a corresponding statistic, and these can be levelled up by using them frequently.  Run everywhere, and Terry's speed will increase.  Take damage, and while your health will decrease, your stamina will increase, allowing you to take more hits.  Steal items and your thievery skills will increase, and so on.

The game also supports the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.  Swap Friend Codes with other people, and when you connect to their game on the Internet, you'll be able to exchange data, as well as send an NPC version of your character into their copy of the game.</desc>

The story has the player's character joining the Robo Team 'Numero Uno' and the story unfolds as they attempt to win the Robo Cup. Like all the Custom Robo games, except the GBA incarnation, the battles are conducted in 3D, with the player attempting to defeat their opponent, in a Pokémon fashion similar to the previous games. The touch screen is used to clean off the player's Robo after it becomes dirty, as this reduces its efficiency.

In another first it offers 2 player multiplayer over Nintendo Wi-Fi and allows voice chat and utilises the rivals system seen in Metroid Prime: Hunters.</desc>

The INKT Corporation. as before, manages to drain all colour from the city and also turns its inhabitants, the Raydians, into generic drones. Once again, it is up to Blob and the members of the Colour Underground to restore the city to its vibrant former glory. Blob frees the lands one by one, as he did in the last game, fighting against many foes, including a massive monster created in a factory accident, as he approaches Comrade Black. Black, however, is shown to be more clever than was suggested in the previous game. At one point, he kidnaps the other members of the Color Underground. Once De Blob frees all of Prisma City, he confronts Comrade Black again, only to discover, as he flees to space once again, that Black had used Blob's own journey against him, using color beacons that were mysteriously activated as Blob progressed to power an orbiting satellite to enslave the entire planet. As Blob gets closer and closer, Black taunts him and forces him to make a series of choices: continue on, or rescue a few Graydians that Black had placed in biodomes rigged to explode and risk running out of time. Once Blob finally reaches him, Black uses a high-power beam of color to grow gigantic and fight Blob.</desc>

		<desc>Draglade is a unique take on fighting games.  Scientists have found a way to harness atmospheric energy called G-Cons, into a weapon called a glade, when hit against another object emits a sound.  Promoters realized the potential and soon developed a sport called Grapping, in which fighters use these glades not only to fight, but produce music as well in order to entertain fans.  You play as four different fighters, Hibito, Guy, Kyle, and Daichi, who's only goal is to become the top fighters in the sport of Grapping.

The gameplay is similar to Elite Beat Agents, you have to hit certain points on the screen at a certain time to create a rhythm in order to fight your opponent.  You can unlock other characters or customize your own, each with their own abilities and special moves.

You can also play against a friend using the Nintendo WFC multiplayer.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Quest Monsters - Joker 2</name>
		<desc>Dragon Quest Monsters: Joker 2 gameplay follows closely to its predecessor. Players explore areas and tame wild monsters into their party. Monsters fight in turn-based combat and grow stronger. The battle system itself is very similar to previous Dragon Quest Monsters games. The player controls up to three monsters that make up the party, and can issue them direct orders or set them to one of 4 AI settings. This game features two new monster sizes: large monsters, which use up two spaces on one of the player's two benches, and gargantuan monsters, who take up an entire bench on their own. The main character, who is henceforth referred to as the Hero, does not directly participate in battles except for when the player uses items. He can, however, use any item in his possession and not just the ones 'in hand'. 311 monsters from the Dragon Quest games appear in Joker 2, with a few new species, many from the original "Dragon Warrior Monsters" games. This is the second game in the series to feature Wi-Fi support, after the first Joker game, and the first to support direct battling between players.
Square Enix released Joker 2 Professional, an expanded version of the game, on March 31, 2011. Professional features over 100 new monsters, as well as new regions and abilities, but the same story. Players are able to import their old monsters from the original game.</desc>

		<name>Etrian Odyssey</name>
		<desc>Far away in a vast fertile land lies a small town called Etria.  Peaceful and serene, Etria became famous when a labyrinth was discovered at the edge of its woods.  Those who heard of the labyrinth began to harbor dreams of exploring it.  And so many explorers from all over the world flocked to Etria in dream of achieving wealth, fame, and fortune exploring the vast and mysterious labyrinth.

Etrian Odyssey is a first-person RPG which pits you as an eager adventurer ready to face the dangers of the labyrinth.  At the beginning of the game you are required to create your own "adventuring guild" by creating various characters out of 9 different classes.  You can create as many as you want, but everything costs money, so strategic thinking is a must.  As well, you can only take a party of 5 into the labyrinth, so the remaining characters have to stay in town at the guild hall.  Battles are done in the traditional turn-based style, and he game contains over 125 monsters that guard the labyrinth and the area around it.  Movement is done one step at a time, with players moving in restricted directions (forward, back, left right).  Most of the game is focused on exploring deeper and deeper into the labyrinth while still returning to town in order to restock and resupply.  During the return trips to town, you can also switch out characters in your party if a special class is needed to pass obstacles in the labyrinth.  Also, players are only allowed to save during the return trip to town, making trips to the labyrinth both risky and exciting.

The labyrinth is completely unknown and unexplored, and so one of the important features of the game is the necessity to draw your own maps.  The top screen of the DS shows the action, while the bottom screen shows a gridded area.  In this area, you have to use the stylus to draw out all of your maps.  This means not only marking where the walls and doors are, but having to mark where enemies, treasures, special areas, and staircases are.  It is completely up to you how accurately or haphazardly you want to draw your map.  However, the only way to get out of the labyrinth is to return to the start, so the gameplay becomes even riskier the further you venture into the dungeon.  Managing your map poorly may risk you and party's lives.  Map making is a key concept of this game because it emphasizes adventuring into the unknown and finding out what's around the very next corner.</desc>

		<name>Final Fantasy III</name>
		<desc>In 2006, Final Fantasy III reached North American shores in an official update/remake for the Nintendo DS, finally bringing all of the main Final Fantasy entries to the United States for the first time.

Raised as an orphan by Nina and Elder Topapa in the village of Ur, Luneth, his shy friend Arc, the rebellious Refia and the brave soldier Ingus are chosen as the Four Warriors of Light to send to restore balance to the crystals, and save the world from imminent destruction.

Taking the original game which debuted on the NES, Square-Enix had updated the title with a new cinematic intro, improved graphics and a touch-screen interface to move characters and utilize selection menus. There is also Moogle Mail, a Wi-Fi feature that allows players to send messages to each other via their DS systems. The game has also some revised story elements, detailing the adventures of four friends who find each other, each with new backstories.

Final Fantasy III is a traditional turn-based RPG, which were popular back in the '80s and '90s, but introduced refinements to the genre, such as smarter battle AI. Final Fantasy III is also known for two major milestones in the history of the series: Its introduction of the cheerful Moogles, as well as the introduction of the job system, allowing characters to switch professions throughout the game for new abilities.</desc>

		<name>Final Fantasy IV</name>
		<desc>Final Fantasy IV is a remake of the classic Japanese RPG that was first released for SNES, known as  Final Fantasy II in the West. 

Unlike the many subsequent ports (to Playstation, GameBoy Advance, etc.), this release is a full remake, programmed from scratch with real-time 3D graphics. The characters have a "super-deformed" touch. There is also voice acting during cut-scenes. A new option has been added to the menu, which allows the player to read a conversation between party members and receive advice from them.

It also features many gameplay additions. The difficulty level has been increased, not only beyond the difficulty of the Western SNES release (which was reduced compared to Japanese original and subsequent ports), but even beyond the original difficulty. The party members are still bound by class, but they can now hunt for so-called "augments", which can be found or stolen from enemies and which grant the characters additional bonus abilities, resistances, spells that their class would normally not allow, etc. 

Beside those major changes, there are also plenty of minor additions. It is possible to obtain bonus items after exploring every corner and filling 100% of an area map; Rydia, the summoner girl, has a new monster summon who can be customized in various ways; there is a new quest involving the "naming" moogle of the original game, etc.</desc>

The game offers a graphical enhancement from Ankoku Ry? to Hikari no Ken and Monsh? no Nazo, which was the first remake of the original, as well as utilising the dual screens on the Nintendo DS to display the action and character stats simultaneously.

The main story centres on prince Marth as he embarks on a quest to reconquer his home kingdom and rescue his kidnapped sister. Characters and chapters that were not present in the original have been introduced in this version, as well as some that were omitted for Fire Emblem: Monsh? no Nazo. Over twenty character classes are included in the game as well as over fifty individual characters to aid Marth.

Also included is the ability to save mid battle on special save point so a mistake in the last turn will not force a restart. Other features are the class swap for characters to change their abilities. Online battle features up to five characters per side in a two player battle.</desc>

		<desc>Ghostbusters: The Video Game is a 2009 action-adventure game based on the Ghostbusters media franchise. The DS version of Ghostbusters: The Video Game uses the same stylized aesthetic as the Redfly Studios versions for the Nintendo Wii and Sony Playstation2 but was developed by Zen Studios. Rather than a third person chase camera perspective, the DS version uses a top-down perspective for most of the game. The story is the same as the other versions but the Ghostbusters receive side missions as well as story missions which they can use to boost the populace's opinion of them. Unlike the other versions in this there is no rookie character and the player takes control of the four original Ghostbusters one at a time while issuing commands to the other three. The money earned from missions can be used to buy new equipment and take part in the resource management aspect of the game. Also, between the game hub of the Firehouse &amp; the missions, there are driving segments which uses a chase camera perspective where the player takes Ecto-1 from location to location, catching ghosts along the way.</desc>

		<desc>Glory Days 2 takes the premise of Choplifter! and cranks it up a few notches. A strategic component was added that melds old gameplay with new game concepts. There are a lot of playable vehicles that become unlocked as you advance in the game.

The overall goal of the game is to provide air support for your ground troops as they advance and capture enemy bunkers, ultimately pushing them back enough that they retreat. Players can choose from three aviators and there are sixteen missions in total, moving on in time from classic WWII aircraft to modern day helicopters and F14's.

The strategical component allows the player to take command of ground units and manage funds to build new units. These funds are acquired by completing missions such as saving civilians or capturing bases. Progressively, more powerful units and weapons become available. Multiplayer is supported for up to eight players over Wi-Fi, split into two cooperative teams where the enemy's command centre needs to be taken out. The setup of the battles is completely customizable for different parameters.

Optionally, 3D glasses are supported to add more depth to the action on the screens.</desc>

		<desc>Poppycock!  When the number one pompous adventurer, Henry Hatsworth, discovers a golden hat deep in the jungle, it makes him twenty years younger - but it also unleashes another world, releasing hordes of nasty monsters!  To top it off, the number two pompous adventurer, Weaselby, is one step ahead of Hatsworth - eager to snag up the remaining pieces of the Golden Suit and claim the number one position in the Pompous Adventurer's Club for himself!  Who can grab the suit, put Weaselby in his place, and seal up the other world, all before Tea Time?  Why, Henry Hatsworth, of course!

Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure is a hybrid of two styles of game - the top screen has an action-platformer starring Hatsworth, who must defeat enemies with his sword.  When he does, they fall down into the Puzzle Realm on the Touch Screen, which plays like Tetris Attack.  Players must match the block enemies up with other colored blocks to finally destroy them, before they rise up back to the top screen to harass Hatsworth once again.

Henry also has access to a super meter - by clearing blocks in the Puzzle Realm, he fills it up.  If he fills it up enough, it's Tea Time!  This means that Hatsworth can transform into superpowered steampunk robot that shoots lasers and missiles and is completely invulnerable, which is handy when the player is in a jam.</desc>

In this game you play as a football keeper, who plays for his school football team, winner of the last Football Frontier. However, an alien football team, the Gemini Storm, wants to destroy all the schools. So, as the player one starts going around all through Japan to look for new players to beat the Gemini Storm in a football match. When one reaches the city of Nara, you find out that the Prime Minister was kidnapped, and you'll have to face a football match with a team of undercover agents to save said Prime Minister. Afterward, when traveling to the city of Alpine, you will find the character Shawn Froste, who will help you in defeating the Gemini Storm.

In the game you take control of Mark, the football keeper, in the overworld, where you can collect items, improving yourself with training or taking part in random encounters. On the Inazuma Bus, you can recruit players for your team, restore your FP (Fitness Points) and TP (Technical Points), or travel to the different regions of Japan.
The matches are controlled with the stylus, and when you run into an opposing player, you start a duel which determines the possession of the ball. You can also use special abilities.</desc>

		<name>Infinite Space</name>
		<desc>Growing up as a second class citizen on a back-water planet, Yuri dreamed of being able to travel the stars. After many years he saved up enough credits to buy transport off the planet, but space travel is forbidden to second class citizens, and he is chased by the security forces of the corrupt owner of the planet. To survive the dangers of space Yuri must become a captain, buy and customize star ships, and fight against hostile enemies both on the ground and in space.

The majority of Infinite Space's gameplay involves space ships, both in fighting and in modifying. All ships have a certain amount of space for extra modules to be added, and the abilities and shape of modules must be considered when choosing how to outfit a ship. In ship to ship combat you can control the distance your fleet is from the enemy fleet. During combat a command bar charges. You can use a small amount of the command bar to Dodge, use more to fire a Normal salvo, or expend almost all of it for a Barrage, which fires three times as many shots as Normal. If the opposing fleet uses Dodge before a Barrage then every shot will miss, leaving the attacking fleet at a disadvantage. If a Normal salvo is fired while the opposing fleet is Dodging, then every shot will hit and deal extra damage. Extra combat options come into play with larger star ships equipped with fighter hangars, special weapons, boarding parties, and officers with unique abilities.

The story progresses primarily with text dialogue and the occasional FMV. Sometimes the player is prompted to make a decision in dialogue for Yuri, and these decisions can have far reaching consequences. Additional officers can join Yuri through the story, by hiring them at a mercenary office, or by finding them on various planets. All officers have unique stats and abilities that make them better for a particular role, such as doctor, engineer, or pilot, than others, and these stats and abilities increase in level from combat.</desc>

Meta Knightmare Ultra: Play through the first five games as Meta Knight, with his own special abilities and powers!  Speed is the key!

		<name>LEGO The Lord of the Rings</name>
		<desc>The handheld Nintendo versions of LEGO The Lord of the Rings (based on Peter Jackson's film trilogy, and in turn based on J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy books) follow the same storyline as its home console cousins, where players must help Frodo Baggins and his friends travel from their peaceful home in the Shire to the perilous Mount Doom to destroy a powerful ring created by the antagonistic Sauron.

Like various LEGO games, players control a variety of characters using the control pad (as well as the 3DS Circle Pad) across several levels in an open-world environment, completing a set of quests along the way. Players also need to utilise special items like the Light of Eärendil, Elven rope and a wide arrange of weaponry to defeat several enemies (especially in the dark region of Mordor).

Unlike previous LEGO games, character biographies are also scattered throughout the levels that give players general summaries for each unique character. Red Bricks are also scattered and can unlock special abilities with the Extras menu.

While the slapstick humour is absent in these games, the 3DS and DS versions still retain the family-friendly approach as the home console versions.</desc>

		<path>./Lock's Quest (USA) (En,Fr) [b].zip</path>
		<name>Lock's Quest</name>
		<desc>Lock's Quest is a strategy / action / adventure game, for the Nintendo DS, that follows the adventurous life of a young "Archineer" named Lock (An Archineer is a mix between an architect and an engineer). Lock's village is attacked by an enemy known as the "Clockwork." During the invasion, the story is set in motion when Lock's little sister, Emi, goes missing. Lock, his new friend Isaiah, and Lock's grandfather Tobias set out in search for Emi. Along the way, Lock joins the Archineers and Kingdom Force in hopes of defeating the Clockwork army and their leader Lord Agony.

The game play consists of two main modes of play: "Build Mode" and "Battle Mode." In Build Mode, the player has a limited amount of time to build defenses that will stand up against the approaching Clockwork army. Each defensive object costs a certain amount of "Source" (the game's currency). Many levels have protection objectives that the player must defend and prevent from being destroyed by the Clockwork. The player can build walls and gates of various material types (Wood, Stone, Metal and Spiked), unique "Turrets" that automatically fire at approaching enemies, "Traps" that can be placed in the battlefield and stationary "Helpers" that give nearby turrets specific buffs. Each player can develop a personal strategy that best fits his play-style based off of the current terrain and his choice of defences. New abilities, enemies and areas are constantly unlocked as the player progresses through the entire game.

Battle Mode begins when the Build Mode timer runs out, or when the player chooses to advance to the battle. The player is thrown into a real time battle and must defend the protection objectives for a certain amount of time while holding off the attack. Other objectives include: destroying specific groups of enemies, capturing enemy objectives, rescuing friendly characters and destroying boss enemies. The battles involve controlling Lock directly with the Stylus as the enemies attack. The player may engage the Clockwork enemies in mêlée combat. Doing so brings up various mini games which can increase Lock's attack damage or add a status effect, such as poison, to the Clockwork. Lock may also repair walls and turrets which have been damaged. This also brings up a mini game where the player must use the stylus in a back and forth "ratcheting" motion to fix the wall. Not only is the player able to control Lock directly, but he can move the camera independently from the character. This control scheme allows flexibility for the player to focus on repairing or attacking in one area, while looking at what's going on in another area.

Lock's Quest is broken into 100 Build and Battle phases called "Days," covering a wide variety of areas and scenarios. The story is advanced through interactive free roam areas, villages and cinematic cut scenes which take place in between the battles. Plot twists and character development becomes the vehicle for pushing the game forward after the initial game play techniques are taught in an interactive tutorial. A multiplayer feature is also present in Lock's Quest using the wireless DS multi-card play. In this mode, two players compete head to head in a mix of Build and Battle modes where the players can choose the paths and type of clockworks their opponent will face.</desc>

		<name>Luminous Arc</name>
		<desc>Luminous Arc is a strategy role-playing game. 

The story is set in a world in which there are two groups in apparent opposition: the Luminous church, and the witches. 

During the course of the story, the player controls a party made up of orphans who have been raised by the Luminous church. They are called the Garden Children, and are tasked with the condemnation of witches. However, soon after the beginning of the story, it becomes evident that things are not as clear-cut as they initially seem.

Structurally, the party moves from area to area, and the plot advances as the player progresses through battles. Equipment may be powered up through the use of a vitae forging system. Also, relationships with characters may be strengthened during post-fight "intermissions," leading to some bonuses in future battles.</desc>

		<path>./Lunar Knights (USA) (En,Es).zip</path>
		<name>Lunar Knights</name>
		<desc>Many years into the future, a race of vampires have emerged, plunging planet Earth into darkness with an environmental control system called the 'paraSOL'.  They now control the planet, with humans living in fear.  When all hope seems lost, two boys with amazing power emerge to save the planet.  The Dark Swordsman, Lucian, and a rookie member of the vampire fighting 'Guild', Aaron.

Lunar Knights is an indirect sequel to the Boktai series of games, which takes place many years after.  Its focus is much more on action as opposed to stealth, although some stealth elements from the earlier games remain (for example, you can blow into the microphone to whistle and attract the attention of enemies).  Players control the two characters, Lucian and Aaron.  Lucian fights with a huge sword called 'Vanagand'.  As a result, Lucian has a close combat style.  Lucian uses the power of moonlight to fuel his special attacks and moves.

The other character is Aaron, a gunslinger for the Guild.  He fights by using sunlight to charge up his gun, the Knight, and shoot ranged shots at foes.  Aaron's special attacks and moves use up sunlight.  Both Aaron and Lucian can use junk materials to increase the level of their weaponry, giving them more power.

The main goal of the game is to make your way through the dungeons and purify the vampire at the end.  The dungeons themselves are fairly standard - you search for treasure chests, avoid traps and solve puzzles.  At the end, you'll fight a boss vampire, and once you've defeated them, the Casket Rocket will be called.  Because the vampires have blocked out the sun on Earth, you'll need to take the vampire into space to purify them.

At this point, the game becomes a touch screen controlled shooter.  To control the ship itself, you drag it around the screen with the stylus.  To shoot enemy ships, you tap them with the screen.  Once you reach the end, the vampire will be purified by the magnified power of the sun.</desc>

		<name>Mario Hoops 3 on 3</name>
		<desc>Square and Nintendo reunite for a unique take on the basketball genre in Mario Hoops 3 on 3. Mario Hoops uses almost exclusively the DS stylus to play both offense and defense. Despite having all the moves you would expect from a basketball game the rules are quite different. Instead of 2-3 pointers. You collect coins along the ground which affect your score if you make a basket. Games can get on average up to 300 points.

On the offensive side you can tap the screen to dribble the ball, swipe in your teammates direction to pass, stroke up to dunk, and show your impressive ball handling skills by dribbling the ball in full 360 degrees around your character.

On the defensive side you can do everything from jumping, to stealing, to blocking. The game even allows for goal tending. This isn't your fathers basketball game.

Included in the game is the ability to rise through the ranks in tournament mode, play against your friends in multiplayer one on one,  and hone your skills in challenge mode. With over 15 courts, unlockable balls, and more than 18 of the most popular Mario and Square characters.

Playing tournament mode pits you and your team of 3 players up against 3 teams in a battle for the typical Mario style cups. While doing so new characters, courts, and balls will be unlocked all of which you can use in singleplayer or multiplayer.

There are two multiplayer modes. One of which is a race to see who can get 100 points by dribbling. This game is 4 player and supports DS download play. The main multiplayer mode is a 1 on 1 battle. Each player has 3 teammates and battles in two periods to see who can get the most coins.</desc>

		<desc>A spin-off of the Mega Man Battle Network franchise, this game brings the franchise back with similar RPG gameplay but with an all-new Mega Man character and storyline to play through. This action RPG blends exploration with fast-paced battles, as players travel between real world and virtual "Wave World."

In Mega Man Star Force, players explore towns and interact with people in the real world while the action-packed battles take place in the virtual "Wave World." Enemy encounters take place on a three by five grid in a 3D perspective, where players use a portfolio of Battle Cards that each have distinct attributes and attack powers. As the story progresses, players will acquire additional cards to build an arsenal that reflects their personal strategy. Players can also connect wirelessly via the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection with friends to create a Brother Band network, where they can share cards and get status upgrades.</desc>

There is also the option to play through all four games in one continuous playthrough, rather than having to select each game individually.

		<desc>Grey was a Reploid found in a hidden factory in suspended animation, accidentally awakened during battle.  Ashe was a human Hunter, chasing after treasures and bounties.  After their encounter with the evil Prometheus, they were rescued and taken to a Hunter Base, where their first mission was to help transport a mysterious Biometal.  With another attack on the train occurring during their mission, they attempt to protect it - the Biometal, Model A, fuses with them, allowing them to become a powerful Mega Man!  But other people are after Model A as well...

Mega Man ZX Advent is the sequel to Mega Man ZX.  Players can choose to play as either Grey or Ashe, each with their own storyline and slightly different weaponry, but the overall game remains the same.  The game itself plays much like the side-scrolling platformer Mega Man X.  However, once the main character fuses with the Biometal, they can transform into Model A, which allows them to steal the data of bosses, taking on their appearance as well as their abilities.</desc>

		<desc>Many years after the events in the Mega Man Zero series, humans and Reploids (humanoid robots) have at last found peace.  Two humans, Vent and Aile, work for a delivery company called Giro Express.  After being ambushed during a delivery, they come in contact with something called 'biometal', which transforms them into the Maverick Hunter, X.  Using their new powers, they decide to work for a group called "The Guardians", who protect civilians from Maverick attacks.

Mega Man ZX is a side scrolling platformer for the Nintendo DS.  While the gameplay is similar to the Mega Man X series, in that you find powerups to increase your health meter, gain subtanks to store surplus energy when needed, and gain new abilities such as swimming and flight through acquiring boss powers, the art style is more similar to the Mega Man Zero series of games.

As players progress through the game, they gain the power of different types of "biometal", which gives them robotic weaponry and abilities.  Different situations require different biometal suits, and sometimes (such as in civilian areas), it's best to return to your human form so that you can make your way through areas without being hassled.  New models of biometal can be acquired from boss enemies.  While you can hit their weak spots for more damage, it's actually beneficial not to, as the more damage you do to the weak spot results in more repairs that you need to make to the biometal later.</desc>

		<name>Meteos</name>
		<desc>Designed by Masahiro Sakurai and produced by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, Meteos was the DS's second big-name puzzle game (after Polarium).  

Most of the game's action takes place on the bottom of the DS's two screens, where colored meteors plummet downwards towards a planet's atmosphere.  There, they form columns that the user can manipulate with either the stylus or a combination of the D-pad and A button.  When three or more meteors of the same color are arranged either vertically or horizontally, they "ignite" and rocket up towards the top screen.  Rockets carry upwards any other metors that happen to be above them, and by stringing together several ignitions it is possible to lift many blocks at once.  The ultimate objective of the game is to lift as many metors as possible back into "orbit" in the top screen; the game is over if the bottom screen fills up completely with meteors.  Meteos features many different "planets" that the user can play on, each with subtle variations (such as in gravity) that affect gameplay.</desc>

The year is 2058 and you and your squad are sent to the moon to investigate strange things that have been happening at the new moon bases. An alien hatch has been discovered at the construction site of one of the bases. So you need to take charge and take care of business.

As its predecessor, it tries to fill the lack of shooters for Nintendo's handheld. With the stylus for aiming, the D-pad for moving and the shoulder buttons for shooting, Moon revisits the late 90's style of shooter started by the Quake series.

The game features 24 episodes, 7 different weapons, various levels of difficulty, bonuses and other game modes to unlock.</desc>

		<name>N+</name>
		<desc>N+ is an enhanced version of the game N, originally a flash based browser game. Players control a small, but very agile ninja through different small areas. Next to movement, only a single button is used to jump, but this allows the ninja to run up walls, do wall jumps and cross large distances.

Levels are divided over different episodes unlocked gradually. Each level consists of a single screen with a time limit. The amount of time can be replenished by collecting golden coins, but the main goals is to activate the exit, usually by touching a specific button or opening a number of doors. Areas are filled with hazards such as spikes and droids that shoot laser or rockets. There are also obstacles such as platforms that only move in a single direction or falling damage from high platforms. Death is always instant, but the player is given an unlimited amount of tries.

The PSP version includes a mix of original levels and user-created ones with about 200 in total. There is also a level editor and unlike the Xbox 360 version these can be shared with other players. The PSP version shows the levels from a "medium" distance, while the DS version contains a far view and a close view on the screens. Physics are also slightly different in each version.

There are both competitive and cooperative game modes available in multiplayer sessions. Players can switch between the pure mode with original graphics and the plus mode with enhanced visuals. The unlockables includes victory screens, new music and new colours for the ninja.</desc>

		<desc>A shooter of the vertical scroller type, Nanostray is similar to past games like Raiden and Tyrian to mention but a few. 

Players unlock features (concept art, backgrounds etc.) by fighting through an adventure mode, which in turn allows finished levels to be played in arcade mode, which is purely for attaining high scores. High scores in arcade mode can be logged on the games official site for ranking against other players around the world.

Adventure mode also allows players to tackle missions in non linear order, however all three in one group must be finished before the next three can be attempted and so on.

The touch screen is used for current status and to scan the end of level bosses for weaknesses.

Challenge modes are added when adventure levels are completed, allowing players to play through the game with a set of restrictions, making high scores more difficult, but increasing the challenge and lastability of the game.

Two players can fight competitively to get the highest score before a timer ends or be the first to reach a certain predefined limit of points.

The game supports single cart play for multiplayer so only one copy is needed.</desc>

In the game, players must build Ninja Huts at key spots along a set pathway to defend each of the game's 36 levels from the invading forces of Mr. Demon. Players can build up to eight different kinds of Ninja Huts, each kind containing its own category of Ninja, from Wasabi pea-shooting Sniper Ninjas to bearded Mountain Ninjas. 

There are also a variety of "Ol' Master Ninja Powers" that can help the player in a pinch. These range from blowing into the DS microphone to push enemies backwards with a gust of wind to tapping enemies on screen in a short period of time in order to deal extra damage to them.

The game is divided into 9 "districts", each containing 3 standard tower defense maps and 1 boss map. Each level in the game takes about 10-15 minutes to complete, with the full game clocking in at around 6-8 hours.</desc>

Colored tiles rise up from a bin, and its your job to arrange them horizontally or vertically in lines of three or more of the same tile.  This causes them to disappear.  Advanced players will be able to arrange tiles so that when they land, they clear additional tiles to stop the tiles from rising and score even more points!

Planet Puzzle League features a wide variety of different game modes to keep even the most dedicated puzzler busy:

1.  Endless - Play forever until you fail.  The tiles rise faster over time.
2.  Clear - Remove all the blocks down to the 'CLEAR' line, buried deep down.
3.  Garbage Challenge - Garbage blocks rain down on your bin - clear as many as you can!
4.  Vs. COM - Play against the CPU.  Try to get their tiles to reach the top of the bin first!
5.  Time Attack - See how many points you can earn in two minutes.
6.  Puzzle - Either clear the preset mind-bending puzzles, or try the various missions that you are given.

Similar to Brain Age, Planet Puzzle League features a 'Daily' Mode.  Play these short games once a day to track your skill over a long period of time.  Are you getting better?  Or worse?

You can also play multiplayer modes of the game, either locally, or over Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.  Modes of play include Birthday Battle (play against people who share your date of birth), Free Play Battle (play an unranked match), and Friend Battle (play against Friends you've traded Friend Codes with).</desc>

Set in a new region, Sinnoh, it includes 107 new Pokémon, bringing the total up to 493. Pokémon Platinum includes for the first time in the 4th generation, the Battle Frontier which can be played on and off-line, make Poffins on-line. Players can collect badges, challenge the Elite Four, and become the ultimate Pokémon master.

The game continues the basic idea of previous Pokémon games - the player, a new trainer, sets out on a quest to catch every known Pokémon and defeat the Pokémon league. Along the way, the player will attempt to foil the plots of the evil organization, Team Galactic, who seek to use a trio of legendary Pokémon to awaken a sleeping titan with the power to control space. There are many sidequests and other activities along the way, the Battle Frontier, expanded on-line options, downloadable content via Mystery Gift, a brand new GTS with the option to receive notifications of completed traded over the Wii, record battle videos, the option to submit one's Pokémon party data for others to see and the Distortion World, which defies the laws of gravity and contains Platinum's mascot, Giratina.

The core Pokémon series features an RPG turn-based battle system. Each monster can learn up to four attacks. In a single turn, the two opponents select their attacks, and the one with the higher Speed attacks first. The amount of damage is influenced by the Attack and Defense stats. In the past, attacks were automatically classified as Physical or Special based on their elemental type. In Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum each attack can be individually categorized, so attacks which use natural elements are Special, and those which use simple force are Physical.

The Pokémon Contests from Ruby and Sapphire return, with many new features. In addition to the attack performance, where the player must try to impress the judge with flashy moves, players will also dress up their Pokémon and dance in time to music. Diamond and Pearl also bring back the real time system from Gold and Silver, where day and night are reflected in your game. Some Pokémon are only catchable during certain times.</desc>

		<path>./Pokemon - HeartGold Version (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Pokémon: HeartGold Version</name>
		<desc>Pokémon HeartGold is an enhanced remake of one of the second installments in the Pokémon Main RPG Series, Pokémon Gold.

Set in the region of Johto, the player controls a new Pokémon Trainer on his/her way to meet up with Pokémon Researcher Professor Elm at his lab to receive his/her first Pokémon. While running an errand for Elm, the player returns to find that a thief has stolen one of the professor's Pokémon. This event starts your quest to becoming a Pokémon master, leading you through the region of Johto and later Kanto, to battle the mysterious Team Rocket and capture all 493 Pokémon. 

Along with retaining most of the original game's features, HeartGold contains quite a few new updates. Like Gold the story will incorporate the legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh (who can be seen on the game's box art), although this time in a bigger fashion. Graphics have been upgraded to 3D models to resemble the series previous Nintendo DS iterations, Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum. The ability to have any one of your Pokémon following you on the Overworld Screen which was limitedly seen in Pokémon Yellow has been added. 

Included with the game is a peripheral known as the Pokéwalker. Acting as a pedometer, the Pokéwalker allows you to wirelessly transfer a Pokémon from HeartGold to it. When there is a Pokémon in the Pokéwalker it gains "experience points" for each step you take. The player also earns a form of money known as "watts", which is used to help catch other Pokémon and buy items.

The game is compatible with the following games via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection: Pokémon SoulSilver, Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum.</desc>

		<desc>Accord, teacher of the local magic school, has lost her magic flying cane. There is word of an award so the students are busy searching high and low for it. Naturally our heros, Amitie and her school nemesis Raffine, make their way toward the distant dark castle. Challenging, and being challenged by, everyone you come across in a game of, Puyo Pop!  

A puzzle game of the falling-block variety the goal of which is to clear your blocks (Puyos) by is the combining four or more of the same color which will vanish. This will produce Nuisance Puyos. These colorless Puyos will fall onto you opponents screen, thus blocking chains and combos they could create. These pesky Puyos can only be exterminated by removing neighboring Puyos.

When an opponent send Nuisance Puyos to you screen you can try to "offset" by clearing your own Puyos and limiting the number that would fall on your screen. This will also increase your Fever Meter. When this meter fills you will be given a set of prearranged Puyos with which you can wrack up giant combos and send tons of Nuisance Puyos to you opponent. When any players field becomes so full they can no longer drop Puyos they lose the game.

Puyo Pop Fever features a Two Player Mode. Some versions allow for more people such as the DS version which allows up to eight players to compete in free-for-all or team modes.</desc>

The Touch Screen on the Nintendo DS is put to use all throughout the game, including navigation through every menu and even a revolutionary new control where the player steers the steering wheel with the stylus or thumb ring.

Another addition to the game is the use of the Nintendo DS's Wi-Fi capabilities.  Using wireless communication, up to 6 players can race against each other.  In fact, up to 6 players can play with a Game Card in only one of the systems.  The other 5 players don't even need the game.  There will be more items, such as cars, available to play with if all of the systems have a Ridge Racer DS Game Card in though.  So there is an advantage to having multiple Game Cards.</desc>

		<name>Scribblenauts</name>
		<desc>Scribblenauts is a side-scrolling action game based on puzzles. The goal is to have the character Maxwell overcome obstacles by summoning objects based on a dictionary of more than 20.000 words, partly based on the concept of the real-life game Mad Libs. This is done by writing an object's name on the touchscreen, letter by letter. When the word is recognized, the object spawns in the world, where it can be manipulated or act on its own. This leads to an endless amount of possibilities to progress through the game. For instance, when an item needs to be retrieved from a tree, you could summon a ladder to get it out, a football to hit it, or just a helicopter or an albatross to fly over there. There are also more bizarre examples, such as summoning a time machine, going back in time to fetch a dinosaur egg, make it hatch and then use it in the future to defeat an army of robot zombies. The list also includes weapons, historical people, and even references to popular cultures and internet memes. Profanity and trademarked objects are not recognized. There is also a spelling checker included to offer suggestions.

This game is a logical sequel to the gameplay mechanics of Drawn to Life, an earlier title by 5TH Cell, relying on the same concept of emergent gameplay, where the actual game is more of a toolbox, shaped through the player's interaction and different in each session. During the game Maxwell needs to collect starites. To do this, two to four objects are often summoned at the same time. There are general, slow puzzle levels, but also faster action levels filled with enemies, platforms, switches and traps. Often, the summoned objects and characters need to interact with each other. Players can earn "merits" for not using weapons in a level for instance and finding a more creative approach. When a level is completed, a silver star is awarded and the Free Play mode for the level is unlocked. When the level is then completed three more times, using a different approach each time, a gold star is provided.

By solving puzzles, Ollars are awarded, the game's currency. It can be exchanged for different avatars or visual changes. The game includes a level editor and support for Wi-Fi to share the levels. The existing levels can also be edited and the way certain summoned objects interact with each other can also be modified.</desc>

It focuses on the events surrounding the kidnapping of Knuckles the Echidna and the disappearance of the Chaos Emeralds, which leads into a much larger story. This game is notable for being the first (and so far only) RPG in the Sonic series.

The story of Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood is split into ten chapters. The first six take place in Sonic's world, with the team attempting to find Knuckles, and trying to stop the Master Emerald from being taken by the Marauders. The final four sees Sonic and the team traveling to another dimension, called the Twilight Cage, in order to stop a new threat to their own world and confront the alien species that reside there.</desc>

		<desc>While flying in their plane across the ocean, looking for a strange energy source, Sonic and Tails' plane is struck by lightning!  They plunge into the murky depths of the ocean...and awaken on a small island.  A local, a raccoon named Marine, informs them that they are on Southern Island.  With Marine and Tails' help, Sonic sets about to explore the nearby islands.

Sonic Rush Adventure is a side-scrolling adventure game, and the sequel to Sonic Rush.  Sonic's goal through these platform levels is to zip through as quickly as possible.  By pressing the B Button while in the air, Sonic can increase his Tension Gauge by performing aerial tricks. Pressing Y uses a Super Boost, which will allow him to plow through anything in his path at amazing speed, but drains the Tension Gauge.

When Sonic reaches the treasure chest at the end of each level, he will be given a material that can be used for construction of ships and other devices.  At first, Sonic is stranded on Southern Island, but after the construction of the waterbike, he can travel to other islands and explore them.  Similar to The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass, the player must plot a path to the next island using the stylus, and then provide limited control over the ship as it travels.  However, Sonic has different ships, each of which are notably different from Link's steamboat.

Sonic Rush Adventure also features a Battle Mode, where players can either play locally with a friend, or across the world through Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.  Players can take each other on in a one-on-one race through various levels as each player aims to get to the end first.</desc>

		<name>Sonic Rush</name>
		<desc>Sonic's first outing on the Nintendo DS system features action in two screens with a story featuring Sonic getting involved in another one of Dr. Eggman's evil plots. A mysterious Emerald is left behind by Dr. Eggman, but an unfamiliar character makes off with it before Sonic can investigate! Sonic gives chase, and thus the adventure begins.

Playable characters in the game are Sonic the Hedgehog and new character Blaze the Cat. Appearances from other character include Miles "Tails" Prower, Amy Rose, Cream the Rabbit, and Knuckles the Echidna. Each playable character has four moves as well as a variety of "Trick actions" which, when performed, will raise your Tension Gauge. Filling the gauge allows you to do a Boost which will propel Sonic or Blaze at a high speed across the ground or along the air to defeat enemies or move certain blocks.

There are 14 levels that play out over both the top and bottom DS screens, giving you a bigger view of your surroundings. You will race through the levels collecting rings, using "gimmicks" such as bungee ropes and giant waterwheels, performing tricks, collecting power-ups, and defeating enemies. When you beat each level, or "act", you will face a Boss Act which is played out over the top screen in 3D. In addition to these levels, there are Special Stages. These are played on the touch screen, and unlike the rest of the game, feature control with the stylus.

Upon completion of the game, Time Attack mode will be available. In it, you play levels/boss acts for the best time record. Battle Play is a multiplayer mode in which two players compete to finish a level first. It can be played over single-card download or multi-card wireless.</desc>

		<desc>Junior Nanairo Interplanetary Patrol officers Rallen and Jeena are on a routine mission when they hear a strange distress call. They find the wreckage of an ancient escape pod. Its inhabitant is in cryogenic sleep and when revived tells them about a terrible new threat: the Krawl. The Krawl are an alien lifeform who consume whole planets, and they have already been spotted in this part of the galaxy. 

Fortunately, there is a way to defeat them. This requires the help of an extinct lifeform called Spectrobes. Rallen and Jeena must visit planets to find fossils of these Spectrobes, excavate, awaken and train them. There are almost 500 different ones for the player to collect and trade. To excavate a Spectrobe, the player must first locate it using another Spectrobe. Using the stylus on the touch-screen, one can carefully remove layers of rock and soil to dig up the fossil, without damaging it. 

The fossil must then be taken back to the space ship, put in a machine and awakened by using your voice or blowing in the microphone. The soil also contains various crystals and minerals, which can be used to feed and train the Spectrobes. They will evolve to stronger and more effective stages. 

The Krawl are on the planets in the form of vortexes. Walking too close to them triggers a battle, in which two Spectrobes join Rallen against the enemy. With a combination of buttons and shoulderbuttons the Spectrobes can unleash special attack powers or combine their respective attacks in real time action.

Via WiFi and on a dedicated website players can battle against each other or exchange Spectrobes and items. Special collectibles can be downloaded. Items and Spectrobes can also be added to the game using game cards with holes through which the touch-screen must be touched in a specific order.</desc>

		<name>Yoshi's Island DS</name>
		<desc>After failing to kidnap the Mario Bros. in the original Yoshi's Island, Kamek the Magikoopa has decided to set his sights higher.  Instead of just kidnapping the famous brothers, he's sent an army of his toadies out to kidnap children across the world!  Luckily, Mario avoids escape, and again lands in the hands of the Yoshis.  It's up to the Yoshis to carry Mario across Yoshi's Island and rescue Luigi and the other babies.

Yoshi's Island DS is a sequel to the SNES game, Yoshi's Island.  In it, players control Yoshi as he travels to Kamek's castle to rescue Luigi.  Yoshi can carry Baby Mario, Peach, DK, Wario or Bowser on his back - depending on the baby carried, Yoshi will gain a special ability; for example, Mario lets Yoshi dash, Peach allows Yoshi to float for a longer period of time, and Wario whips out a gigantic magnet to attract coins and other metallic objects.  If Yoshi is hit by an enemy, a counter appears, and begins to slowly count down to zero.  If it reaches zero, the baby is kidnapped, and Yoshi loses a life.  Yoshi can increase his counter by collecting stars that are rewards for some puzzles and defeating certain enemies.

Another feature of Yoshi's Island DS is the ability to hurl eggs to defeat foes.  Yoshi can eat nearly every enemy - if you press down on the control pad when Yoshi is holding an enemy in his mouth, he will turn it into an egg.  Yoshi can hurl his eggs at enemies and objects such as certain walls to destroy them.  You can even pick up coins and other collectibles by throwing an egg at them.  Finally, Yoshi can ricochet eggs off walls to hit things that he would otherwise be unable to reach.

While the object of each level is to simply reach the end, avid gamers will aim to get 100% for each level.  To do this, they must reach the end of each level with thirty stars, find the twenty red coins hidden amongst the regular ones, and collect the five flowers in each level.  One special  "Character Coin" is also hidden in each level - these have a picture of a particular baby on them, and can only be collected when Yoshi has that baby on his back.</desc>

There are 5 varied game play modes: Normal, Tokoton, Quest, Time Attack and 2P.  Normal mode has you clearing a set amount of animals each level before progressing to the next.  Tokoton is similar to Normal, but has all the animal amounts set to 100 before you'll level up.  Quest has you playing ten set stages with specific goals (such as only capturing animals of a certain type) that you must attempt to achieve.  Time Attack has you aiming to get the highest score possible in the time limit.  2P has two players battling it out against each other.</desc>

		<name>Avalon Code</name>
		<desc>Avalon Code is a hack and slash Action-RPG that takes place in a world about to end.  Choosing between a male or female avatar, the player is given the Book of Prophecy from which the world will be remade.  Everything in the world can be scanned and recorded into the Book of Prophecy, and players can further redefine an entry's properties by mixing and matching pieces of code.  

Codes in Avalon Code are Tetris-like chunks which fit into each book entry's grid of available code space.  Think of these codes like genes in a DNA sequence that you can grab and move with the stylus.  For example, elemental properties (such as fire) can be incorporated into a weapon, allowing you to melt ice.  Removing codes from enemies allows you to weaken them, making them easier to dispatch.

Players string together light combos and can perform charged special moves.  Additionally, the player can begin a Judgment Link which juggles the enemy higher and higher (with proper timing) which yields precious HP, MP and Gem bonuses.  Dungeons are somewhat unique in that each room is a timed challenge, with requirements such as hitting all switches, defeating all enemies, Judgment Linking xN, and/or various combinations of these.</desc>

		<path>./Inazuma Eleven (Europe).zip</path>
		<name>Inazuma Eleven</name>
		<desc>Inazuma Eleven is a blend of a football (soccer) game and traditional RPG. The game stars Mark Evans, the captain and goalkeeper of Raimon Junior High School's football team. However, it seems that he is the only one who cares about playing as his teammates prefer to waste time in the clubroom. Because of that their club is the laughing stock of the whole school and on the verge of being disbanded. The team is given one last chance in winning a friendly match against one of the best teams. When all seems lost, there appears a transfer student and well-known player ? Axel Blaze. The team now has hopes for winning, but there are others that, for some reason, don't want the club to exist.

The game is divided into classic top-down exploration, during which the player walks around and interacts with NPCs, and real-time football matches. The matches play out in real-time and are controlled only with the stylus. All of the teammates on the field move automatically with the player being able to manually draw or point to their destination. Encountering a rival or enemy goal, the game pauses and the player is able to choose his action. These consist of standard moves and anime-styled supernatural skills.

As in any RPG, teammates gain levels and improve their statistics, which affect the way they perform and the outcome of their actions. The team is fully customizable with your teammates' position on the field and hundreds additional players among whom to recruit new ones from.</desc>

Players control Mario and Luigi simultaneously in the side-scrolling platform environment of Bowser's body, while also controlling the Koopa King himself in the top-down world of the Mushroom Kingdom. Similar to games like Earthbound, enemy encounters are seen as actual enemies that players can avoid or attempt to strike early. The actual battles are a combination of turn-based menu attacks, and timed reactions to enemies during battle. By watching the way an enemy reacts, you can anticipate their attack and avoid it or counterattack.</desc>

		<name>Pokémon Ranger: Guardian Signs</name>
		<desc>In the region of Oblivia, a gang of thieves known as the "Pokémon Pinchers" are stealing wild Pokémon and planning to use them for their own nefarious purposes.  Two Pokémon Rangers, Summer and Ben, are sent to investigate.  However, after an encounter with the Pinchers, one of them is kidnapped while the other is left stranded on an island.  There they meet a Pichu with a ukulele, who teams up with them to help rescue its Pichu friends who have also been captured by then Pinchers.  Can you rescue your partner, and save the Pokémon of the Oblivia region?

Pokémon Ranger: Guardian Signs is the third in the Pokémon Ranger series.  As with the previous games, you move your character around using a device known as the stylus, as well as battling with a device called the "capture styler" (represented by the stylus).  To battle, you encounter a Pokémon on the touch screen, and your aim is to repeatedly draw connecting loops around it until you deplete its health to zero, allowing it to join your team.  Pokémon can be used in the environment to clear obstacles and help you progress (such as such as cutting trees, extinguishing fires and so on), or by assisting you in battle and helping you weaken enemy Pokémon.  Near the start of the game, Ukulele Pichu becomes a part of your team and randomly appears during battles to assist.  If you tap it when it appears, it will jump into battle and play its ukulele, which scatters musical notes around the screen which weaken enemies.

A little bit further into the game, you also gain the help of the Legendary Pokémon dogs, Raikou, Entei and Suicune, first introduced in Pokémon Gold and Silver.  These Pokémon have special abilities that allow you to reach places that you normally couldn't (for example, Raikou can leap across large gaps).  To summon these Pokémon, you must draw a special sign with the stylus that represents them, but these can only be drawn outside where the sky can be seen.

After a key point in the game, you also unlock the ability to travel back in time with Celebi, which gives you access to wireless multiplayer Pokémon Ranger missions.  These missions can be played with up to four players, and Rangers can team up to help capture Pokémon more quickly.  This is a great help as each mission must be completed within a certain time for it to be a success.  Most wireless missions can also be played solo, but are more difficult this way.  You can also earn experience which can be used to increase your capture styler's power, health and speed.</desc>

		<name>Ultimate Spider-Man</name>
		<desc>For Ultimate Spider-Man for the DS, developer Vicarious Visions takes the technology and gameplay style  of their earlier Spider-Man 2 to adapt the storyline of the console version for the handheld.

Based on the Ultimate Spider-Man comic series, the game follows up on the comic's storyline about Peter Parker's childhood friend Eddie Brock and the Venom suit. Three months after his apparent death, Venom roams the streets of New York again. Thus Spider-Man must not only deal with the usual assortment of criminals and supervillains but also his old friend, while both Trask Industries and S.H.I.E.L.D. have set their sights on Eddie, who struggles to take control of the Venom suit. The DS game follows a cut-down version of the console version's storyline, but differs a lot in the details. The story is told in comic-style cutscenes that emulate the drawings of series artist Mark Bagley and also feature voice acting.

The game is a 2D side-scroller with real 3D graphics, with the camera moving and rotating to always keep the protagonist in view. Players will play as both Spider-Man and Venom, who have different abilities and are controlled in fundamentally different ways. Both must beat up various enemies and fight bosses, but other goals vary between the two.

Spider-Man is controlled via a standard button interface, allowing him to jump, swing along his web, punch, kick, shoot web balls and use his web to zip to walls and ceilings. When attack moves are stringed into combos, a power meter fills up that allows Spidey to unleash a special move that can be selected beforehand from the touch screen. His Spider-Sense also comes into play: when in immediate danger, an icon flashes. Pressing the left shoulder button within time allows Spider-Man to dodge the attack that follows.

A large part of Spider-Man's levels consists of rescuing innocents - freeing them from below heavy objects or carrying them away from danger. Lifting up the objects requires stroking upwards on the touch screen. The screen is also used for modifying electronics or disarming bombs. Lights flash up on a grid: green ones must be touched and red ones avoided.

In contrast, Venom is controlled almost exclusively through the touch screen. Alternate button-based controls are available but don't offer the full variety of moves. Venom can attack through either his claws or his tendrils by tapping either close or away from him. He can also use his tendrils to pick up objects and enemies and throw them around or smash them to the ground, all done through stylus movements. A further use of the tendrils is a targeted attack launched by stroking away from Venom in the wanted direction. 
Another gameplay element that only applies to Venom is feeding. The Venom suit drains Eddie's health constantly, so he must feed on humans to survive. This is done by simply tapping and holding the intended victim.

The game features branching paths: at some points, players can choose where to continue with the story (like Spider-Man choosing on whether to confront Shocker or the Rhino), leading to different sets of levels.

A multiplayer mode is also available: it features five different characters and eight arenas for one-on-one fights.</desc>

Double Trouble is a standard side-scrolling beat-em-up in the vein of earlier entries in the Viewtiful Joe series. As with earlier entries in the series, Double Trouble sets itself apart from other games in the genre with the inclusion of VFX powers. The VFX powers in this game include:

Slow - Joe's signature VFX move, this allows him to slow down time to effectively dodge and counter enemy attacks.
Scratch - Shake things up and drop items on enemies, or just shake them until they're dizzy.
Split - Alter your environment by cutting a new path yourself.
Slide - Get a closeup view of the action and add a little extra power to Joe's hits.

		<name>Metroid Prime - Hunters</name>
		<desc>An episode in the Metroid Prime series which started on the GameCube, this game takes place between Metroid Prime and Metroid Prime 2: Echoes. Interstellar bounty hunter Samus Aran is sent to the distant Alimbic Cluster by the Galactic Federation to investigate a message saying that the source of ultimate power lies in this desolate part of the galaxy, once home to an advanced culture.

Samus is not alone, however. Other races have heard this mysterious message, too. Six other bounty hunters, each with unique characteristics, will do everything to get their hands on the Alimbic relics for their own reasons.

The single-player mode is more focused on shooting than other Metroid games but also has puzzles in classic Metroid fashion. Unlike previous games, Samus has all her moves from the start, but she still has to look for weapons. The player may also run into other bounty hunters in this mode.

The multiplayer mode is similar to Unreal Tournament or Quake games. Players can choose from any hunter that was defeated in single-player mode. There are seven modes in total including: Nodes, Survival, Bounty, Prime Hunter, Battle, Capture, and Defender. Each mode has its own unique rules. There are a vast number of arenas that can be played over local wireless or Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. When using friend codes, voice chat before and after matches is enabled.</desc>

		<name>Space Invaders Extreme</name>
		<desc>The pixelated aliens are back to celebrate their 30th anniversary!

Taking a cue from other recent arcade classic updates, Space Invaders Extreme takes the gameplay of the 1978 classic, and reinvents it, giving power-up blasters, boss aliens, and an electronic soundtrack that plays in sync with the onscreen action.

Basic gameplay remains the same: Players guide a ground based cannon either left or right, blasting an oncoming fleet of invaders before they reach the ground.  The main objective is to get as many points as possible before running out of lives.

Space Invaders Extreme introduces new elements, such as invader fleets that break pattern from their left to right descent, boss aliens that require several hits to destroy, power-ups that enhance the cannon, allowing the player to wipe out multiple invaders at once, while racking up combos.

Wi-Fi play is also possible, allowing player to team up cooperatively, or compete against the other.  The Nintendo DS version also has a feature for online ranking.</desc>

		<desc>When Tiger Island is taken over by the evil Wizpig, Timber sends a letter to Diddy to request his assistance.  Diddy, Dixie, Tiny Kong and the rogue Kremling Krunch turn up to help Timber and his friends, Bumper, Tiptup and Pipsy.

Diddy Kong Racing DS is remake of the Nintendo 64 game of the same name.  However, while the story and setting remains the same, this is more of an upgrade instead of a port.  Players can still race around assorted tracks around Tiger Island via kart, hovercraft or plane, winning races to earn golden balloons to progress and defeating bosses to confront Wizpig.

There have been subtle tweaks to the gameplay.  While you can still level up your balloons by collecting another of the same colored balloon in a row, collecting a different colored balloon will not change your weapon - you'll have to fire your current weapon first.  The Silver Coin Challenge from the original game has been removed from the main adventure, and is replaced with a first-person touch screen shooter where you fly around on Taj's magic carpet and aim to pop as many balloons as you can.  There's also an optional racing mode where you race by using the stylus to guide the vehicle through a top-down map.

The game now supports currency system for most unlockables - dotted along the track are coins, which can be used to buy 'wishes' from Taj the Genie.  These include anything from new characters, exclusive tracks, a custom track editor, battle modes to unlock in multiplayer and so forth.  The DS version of Diddy Kong Racing also heavily supports multiplayer.  You can play with one game card or multiple game cards (to a maximum of eight players), or online to a maximum of six players.  Similar to Mario Kart DS, you can design your own custom decal and have it as your visual representation for when you race around the world.</desc>

		<name>Metroid Prime Pinball</name>
		<desc>In this pinball game based on Metroid Prime, Samus gets knocked and rolled around the table in Morph Ball form; the table contains Metroids, which can latch onto her and suck away health. Tables include the surface of Tallon IV, the Space Station, the Phazon Mines, and more can be unlocked by searching for artifacts and collecting bounties, which are found by destroying Space Pirates and other dangerous creatures.

Metroid Prime Pinball is a pinball game with a Metroid theme. Players can collect power-ups such as missiles and super bombs, which can be helpful when defeating bosses. There are also missions to be completed within a time limit; these missions can involve defeating unique enemies that appear on the table or completing tasks such as wall jumping. Completing missions earns either artifacts or special tokens.

The game also features a single-card multiplayer mode. In this mode, up to eight players can play. The game is a race to see who can reach a certain score first. Players lose points if they lose their ball. It is also possible to dump enemies onto opponents' tables to cause trouble for them.</desc>

		<desc>Contra 4 for the Nintendo DS is a direct sequel to 1994 SNES Contra III: Alien Wars. Two years after the defeat of Red Falcon - the first wave of the alien colonization fleet, the main invading force Black Viper approaches Earth. The heroes of the original Contra series - Billy Rizer and Lance Bean as well as two newcomers - Mad Dog and Scorpion are now humanity's last line of defense against total annihilation.

This installment of the long-running series adds dual screen gameplay, enabling the player a wider view, and a 2-player co-op mode via local Wi-Fi connection. Each player is now given two weapon slots which can be filled with any one of the game's many weapon power-ups and switched at will with a press of a shoulder button. The game features nine levels set in such classic Contra locations as Jungle, Waterfall and a pseudo-3D Base.
As a bonus, the cartridge contains an illustrated history of Contra, as well as the Contra and Super C original NES games.</desc>

A secret monastic organization, Order of Ecclesia, is charged with finding alternative ways of combating the hordes of undead summoned by the ever-returning evil lord Dracula, as the Belmont clan has apparently gone into hiding. Shanoa, a young acolyte of the Order, is chosen for her extraordinary magical abilities to wield Dominus: the ultimate spell against evil. As she is about to complete the ritual to absorb Dominus a rogue acolyte named Albus steals the three tomes containing the spell. Shanoa is then dispatched to track down Albus and return him and the spell back to the Order.</desc>

		<desc>Help the Biker Mice From Mars, Vinnie, Modo, and Throttle, in their quest to save planet Mars from destruction with the help of the Regenerator, a machine that can create water for the Martians to continue to survive with.  With the original Regenerator destroyed beyond repair, the trio must head to planet Earth to rescue Stoker, who can help them create another.

Biker Mice From Mars is a hybrid of a racing game, and a side-scrolling beat-em-up.  Take the role of Vinnie, Modo or Throttle, and race against opponents as well as beating them up in your quest to rescue the planet Mars.  During the racing sections of the game, you can fire rockets at your foes (once collected from crates scattered on the track), or boost ahead of opponents.  You're also racing against a time limit, and must make it to the end of the track before time is up.  Destroying enemies will add precious seconds to your timer.

The beat-em-up sections are fairly straightforward.  You walk to the end of each stage, beating up opponents with punches and kicks as you progress.  The screen locks into place when a group of enemies appear, and you must beat them before you can move on.  The mice can also pick up thrown grenades and throw them back at enemies, as well as climb up and down certain objects to take different paths.</desc>

		<desc>Arino wants to be the greatest gamer in the world, but he's continually defeated by his friends at every new game that comes out. His obsession has spawned a digital version himself within his own Nintendo DS. This digital version of himself has come to be known as "Game Master Arino", who haunts gamers around the world with retro game challenges. You have been chosen by Game Master Arino, and are now trapped in the 1980s until you can defeat his game challenges.

Retro Game Challenge, based on the Japanese TV show Game Center CX, has you playing faithfully-recreated clones of popular NES-era games, attempting to complete challenges and freeing yourself from Game Master Arino. You are accompanied by Arino himself as a young lad, who will cheer you on as you're playing each game. You can also read the latest gaming mags for tips, cheats, and previews of upcoming titles.

There are eight games total, each modeled after 8-bit classics such as Galaga (Cosmic Gate), Dragon Warrior (Gaudia Quest), and Ninja Jajamaru-kun (Robot Ninja Haggle Man). Each game has multiple challenges from Arino to complete, such as clearing a certain stage or earning a set number of points, and can also be played in a free play mode once all challenges have been cleared.</desc>

		<path>./Tetris DS (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Tetris DS</name>
		<desc>At its base, Tetris DS is the same Tetris gameplay that's been around for years: rotate and arrange Tetriminos to create full lines and make them disappear.  However, it also has a style very different from earlier Tetris games, new play modes, and online play.

Graphically and aurally, Tetris DS is based on classic NES games.  A portion of the graphics are sprites directly ripped from Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 3, Donkey Kong, Balloon Fight, Metroid, Yoshi's Cookie, and The Legend of Zelda.  Remixes of music from these games are also used.

Standard mode includes the standard endless play option, the standard "get 25 lines to win" option, and the standard versus mode where clearing multiple lines at once adds lines to the bottom of your opponents' well.

Push mode is a versus game with a twist.  The player's moves and pieces are shown on the top screen, while the opponent's are on the bottom screen, both with gravity moving towards the center.  Instead of multiple line clears adding extra lines to the bottom of your opponent's well, though, the center is pushed towards their end, giving them a smaller play area.  Push back and forth until one side loses.

Touch mode presents you with a tall uneven stack of large Tetriminos.  The goal is to nudge or rotate them by dragging or tapping on the touch screen to create full lines and eventually clear the stack.

Puzzle mode offers 200 Tetris scenarios and presents you with a number of pieces.  You choose the order and rotation of the pieces to try and empty the well.

Mission mode gives you specific goals like "Use a square block to clear a line" or "Clear 3 lines with an L piece".  Finish the mission and you'll be given another.  Don't finish the mission and several rows of random blocks will be added to the bottom of the well before being given another mission.

Catch mode has the Tetriminos falling without direct player control.  Instead, the player controls a moving core of blocks which can rotate as a whole, as well as latch on to the falling Tetriminos.  The goal is to create a square of at least 4x4, causing an explosion which keeps the size of your core small.  Lose by allowing your core to get too large, or by losing enough energy; which occurs when you allow a Tetrimino to scroll past the bottom of the screen, your rotating core smacks into and destroys a Tetrimino, or you hit a falling enemy.

Multiplayer Standard, Mission, and Push modes can be played locally using one copy of Tetris DS.  Mission allows for up to 10 players competing for a high score.  Standard allows for up to 10 players, and has an option for Mario Kart-like items to aid you or harm your enemies.  Push mode remains a one-on-one experience.  With Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, you can play a two-player Standard game without items, a four-player Standard game with items, or a two-player Push mode game.</desc>

		<desc>Continue the Wind Waker adventure in Link's first DS game.

The epic story of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker continues as Link finds himself lost and alone in unknown seas in a new adventure. Featuring intuitive touch-screen controls and innovative puzzles, The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass offers new challenges for fans of the series and an easy-to-grasp introduction for gamers new to The Legend of Zelda. But time grows short, and only the Phantom Hourglass can buy Link the minutes he'll need to survive.

Many months have passed since the events of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, and Link, Tetra and Tetra's band of pirates have set sail in search of new lands. They come across a patch of ocean covered in a dense fog, in which they discover an abandoned ship. Tetra falls into danger when she explores the ship alone, and Link falls into the ocean when he attempts to rescue her. When he washes up unconscious on the shores of a mysterious island, he is awakened by the sound of a fairy's voice. With the aid of this fairy, he sets off to find Tetra and his way back to the seas he once knew.</desc>

• Wield weapons and solve puzzles, all with your stylus

• Duke it out with friends in multiplayer battle mode

• Link and Zelda adventure together for the first time

The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks sets hero Link on a daring new adventure. The game provides players with a new story, more puzzles and even a new mode of transportation. In this game, Link voyages by train, which offers up new possibilities for problem-solving. The game has the same look and feel established in the hit Nintendo DS game The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass.

• Link has a valuable new companion. While navigating dungeons, he's accompanied by a Phantom, a hulking suit of armor that responds to his commands. Players can tap the Phantom to take command of him, then draw a line on the touchscreen to direct him where to go. The stout Phantom can walk through fire or lava, be used as a platform to carry Link above dangers, or even run interference to block Link from harm.

• When Link conducts the train, players enjoy a satisfying combination of action and real-time puzzle solving as they determine which track to take and how to best manipulate their speed. When on the train, Link must plot the best route to the end of the line around ever-moving obstacles. While en route, Link might need to fire an onboard cannon at enemies who attack the train or sound the whistle to scare animals off the tracks.

• Link uses a variety of new items and weapons, including the Whirlwind, which players activate by blowing into the microphone of the Nintendo DS system.

• As with The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass, players can draw notes on the in-game maps using the stylus on the touch screen.</desc>

		<name>TrackMania DS</name>
		<desc>The TrackMania series is now going portable with this Nintendo DS release.

Race with over 100 tracks by yourself or with your friends. The new modes exclusive to the game are 'Platform', in which you must navigate through complex levels without using too many retries, and 'Puzzle', in which you must create your own map with checkpoints and a limited number of building blocks to connect the pieces, and race to the finish, while the 'Race' mode is left intact. The game includes three environments to race: Desert (the environment used in TrackMania Original), Rally and Stadium (the environment used in TrackMania Nations).

Instead of complex racing simulators where you have to measure a correct speed to turn through narrow roads, this is an arcade-style racing game with high speeds (over 400 km/h!) and simple controls. All you have is accelerate, brake, horn and that's it! Of course, like it's PC counterparts, you can freely reset the track if you fall of the track, or if you want a better medal. There are three types of medals: bronze, silver and gold. You can either race with AI opponents or race by yourself. The main objective is to get to the finish line as fast as possible. The target time is given to you at the beginning of every track, depending on for which medal you are racing.

The game also includes a built-in map editor, which allows you to create a custom map with your stylus.</desc>
