		<name>N2O : Nitrous Oxide</name>
		<desc>Somewhere deep in the future our Galaxy is at war. On the nearby planet of Neptune, forces of evil have initiated their new plans to invade the Earth. By accelerating sub-atomic particles around a tubular shaped circuit known as The Torus, they are developing a race of Super Warriors. Together with advanced genetic engineering, this central birthing canal is capable of producing an army of lethal genetically mutated insects.
Nitrous Oxide, a pollutant by-product emitted inside The Torus, provides a high octane fuel for your Tunnel Runner, but unfortunately it also provides the perfect breeding environment for the secretly incubating species.</desc>

		<path>./Alien Trilogy (USA).chd</path>
		<name>Alien Trilogy</name>
		<desc>Alien Trilogy is a first-person shooter based on the first three Alien movies. You control Lt. Ripley in three sections, each based on one film: The colony complex on LV426 (from Aliens), the prison planet (from Alien³) and the derelict spaceship (from Alien). Each section consists of about 10 missions. In every mission, certain goals must be accomplished to continue. These include killing a certain number of enemies, finding items or activating switches.

Enemies include everything the Alien life cycle provides: facehuggers, chestbursters, warrior aliens, dog aliens (from Alien³) and Alien queens, one of which waits in the final mission of every section. In addition to the Aliens, you also have to fight employees of the Company, who have either been infected by the Aliens and are beyond saving or who actively want to obstruct your mission.

Weapons to be used include pistol, shotgun, pulse rifle, flame thrower and smart gun. Ammunition, health upgrades and other useful items are scattered throughout the levels. Hidden areas may be uncovered by using explosives like grenades and seismic charges. An auto mapping system helps in not getting lost, night goggles and shoulder lamps (running on battery power) allow you to see in the dark and the motion tracker tells you where your enemies are - but only if they are moving.</desc>

		<name>Arc the Lad Collection : Arc the Lad</name>
		<desc>A girl named Kukuru lives in a village controlled by the Sacred Tribe - people who guard an ancient flame which contains a powerful spirit that was sealed in it many years ago. Kukuru must marry a man she doesn't love, and in order to avoid this marriage, she accepts the offer of the mayor: he asks her to extinguish the flame. As a result, the spirit awakes and threatens to destroy the world. A young adventurer named Arc arrives to the village at the same moment as Kukuru is standing frightened in front of the spirit. Arc immediately recognizes it - it was the murderer of his father! Before he realizes how that could be possible, the spirit disappears, and now Arc and Kukuru have to do everything in their powers to undo the error, to stop the spirit, and perhaps to avenge the death of Arc's father.

"Arc the Lad" is a hybrid of traditional and strategy-based console-style RPGs. The story unfolds as you are transported from location to location and enter battles - you don't walk around on the world map, choosing yourself which location to visit. The battles take place on a battle field, on which you can move and attack only when you approach the opponent.</desc>

		<desc>You play the role of a Raven mercenary, piloting a powerful Mech called "Armored Core". You only work for profit, as the money you make goes towards upgrades and repaires to your mech.

Multi-national companies are lined up at your door, paying you to complete certain objectives, which mainly include the destruction of a certain target or another mech. The more you complete, the better the pay and job offers, therefore allowing you to build the ultimate Armored Core.

Apart from the single player campaign, you can take on a friend in a multiplayer battle. You each control a mech, and battle it out in a large war area (ranging from huge cities to desert planes).</desc>

		<path>./Asteroids (USA).chd</path>
		<name>Asteroids</name>
		<desc>Unlike Activision's earlier remake of an Atari arcade classic, Battlezone, this one stays close to its namesake.  Take the original, Atari coin-op game Asteroids, add in the features of the Atari 2600 cartridge, then give it 3-D graphics and a bunch of power-ups, and you've got Activision's Asteroids remake.

You are an employee of the Astro-Mining Corporation.  Your mission is to simply go to an assigned area of space and clear the area of asteroids and the occassional debris.  The game consists of five zones, each with a different background and some with special features.  Each zone has 15 levels.  In addition to the standard asteroids, there are also mined asteroids that explode; indestructible asteroids that are, well, indestructible; fireball comets; crystal asteroids that regenerate; alien egg asteroids containing deadly baby space worms; and ancient energy asteroids that shoot back!  And there's plenty of enemies in addition to the asteroids, such as Standard and Super Saucers, Asteroids Tugs, Fuel Transports, Hexes, Nuke Drivers, and Vulturoids.

There are three types of ships to choose from, each with different strengths and weaknesses.  There are also three skill levels.  If you beat the game at Expert or higher, you gain access to a fourth type of ship.  All ships features the standard laser, shield, flip (instantly flips your ship 180 degrees), and hyperspace.  There are also limited power-ups you can  pick up such as GunSat, Mines, Homing Missiles, Plasma Drill, and Trigger Bombs.

The game supports either one or two players.  In two player mode, the object is to simply outscore your opponent in a random zone and level.  You cannot directly kill your opponent by shooting him, but there are other ways....

Lastly, if you shoot the classic-style asteroid in level 15 of the first zone, you'll find the option of "Classic Asteroids" now appearing on the main menu.</desc>

This game however, is not in any way related to another similar game made by the same company.

The special combinations applied to enemies can add up to a possible 150+ hits on a single villain. Special weapons, such as Batarangs, can be found throughout the levels.

		<path>./Battle Arena Toshinden (USA).chd</path>
		<name>Battle Arena Toshinden</name>
		<desc>In Battle Arena Toshinden eight world renown weapon fighters have been invited to a mysterious tournament. It is one of the first one-on-one beat-em-ups to feature the ability to sidestep a full 360 degrees around the opponent allowing one to strike from any angle. Aside from the 3d movement, Toshinden's game play can be considered similar to Street Fighter, but in 3d and with a little less depth to the moves.

Two versions of Toshinden were released; for the Sony PlayStation and later a lesser known version for DOS PC's. However the PC version is not a straight port of the PlayStation version and plays and looks notably different despite sharing the same characters, attacks and controls.

The U.S and E.U Playstation versions of Toshinden feature redone voices in English and redone music using different instruments. 

The lyrics on Sofia's stage music in the Japanese version, which were actually in English, were removed in the process, likely due to their suggestive nature. 

Sofia's and Ellis' voices in the English translation are also notably adjusted, for presumably the same reason; while the other characters English voices generally match the tones of the original Japanese voice actors, Sofia is far less suggestive sounding, while Ellis sounds notably older.

The later Dos version of Toshinden however, uses the same audio as the Japanese Playstation version in all regions, albeit recorded at a considerably lower quality than they were on Playstation.</desc>

		<name>Battletanx : Global Assault</name>
		<desc>BattleTanx: Global Assault makes its PlayStation debut with more levels than the earlier Nintendo 64 version. Split-screen multiplayer support is also included, but for two players instead of four. The fast-paced action involves motoring across grid-like environments in one of 13 well-outfitted tanks. Solo players can complete 40 search-and-destroy missions in the campaign mode, while up to two friends can blast each other to scrap metal in seven deathmatch, capture-the-flag, and tag variants. Twenty power-ups are available in total, ranging from cloaking and teleporting devices to plasma bolts and guided missiles. Featured levels take place in futuristic versions of San Francisco, Washington, London, Paris, and Berlin, all of which are home to ruthless, tank-driving gangs.

Prior to the game's beginning, Griffin Spade set about reclaiming his lost love and establishing his tribe in San Francisco. But the peace he'd blasted out for himself looks to be short-lived as he's having frequent nightmares about a sinister QueenLord. It's up to Griffin to mount up again and with all the finesse that a giant tank can muster and solve the mystery behind this evil woman. And so the stage is set for Battle Tanx: Global Assault.</desc>

		<desc>Capcom's third installment of its epic RPG. Breath of Fire III is the first installment of the Breath of Fire Series to appear on the Playstation (And later ported to the PSP). 

Set free by the the workers of Dauna Mine, Ryu of the Brood learns to both understand his power, and to understand the history of his extinct kind. By both utilizing Ryu's unique power and the abilities of those whom assist him, players will uncover the history of the Brood, learn more about the characters, and the very reason why the Brood were wiped out.

Players control Ryu and his allies on their journey, each of Ryu's friends have abilities only they can use, and they will have to work together to make their way through the obstacles and enemies that they encounter; creativity is key to your success in this game!

Ryu eventually is able to utilize his power of the Brood, allowing him to ascend into various dragon-like forms. This is done using a gene-splicing system that dictates what sort of form Ryu will take.

Breath of Fire III also includes a Master System, which permits Ryu and his allies to learn from various people to augment their abilities differently as they gain experience; these trainers can also teach abilities to those whom train hard under them.</desc>

Flying through the sky on their sandflier, Nina and Cray are attacked by a worm shaped dragon. With their vehicle damaged, Nina returns to the city to find parts, bumping into a naked young boy named Ryu along the way, who is unsure of where he is. At the very same time, Nina is again attacked by a dragon. Confused by the strange events taking place, Nina agrees to help the young boy. Meanwhile, the ancient Emperor Fou Lu awakens from his slumber in his tomb. His plan is to return to the world of human, conquer it anew, and impose his iron rule on it...

This fourth installment of the  Breath of Fire series is a fairly traditional Japanese-style RPG, with turn-based combat, party management, linear story progression, and other characteristic elements of the genre. As in the  previous game, characters become stronger and learn new skills by performing tasks for "masters" living in different towns. Ryu, the main protagonist of the series, has retained the series' trademark gameplay element: the ability to turn into a dragon during combat. Breath of Fire IV is rich in mini-games of various types, including the popular fishing mini-game that was present in previous installments as well.</desc>

		<name>Bubble Bobble also featuring Rainbow Islands</name>
		<desc>Bubble Bobble: One or two players attempt to save their friends in this re-release of the 1987 classic puzzle/action game. Players blow bubbles to trap enemies. When they pop the bubbles, fruit comes out and the players compete for the points. If they don't pop the bubbles in time, the enemies escape and become faster.

Rainbow Islands: one player only. Rainbow Islands is the sequel to Bubble Bobble. Instead of bubbles, you create rainbows. The highly versatile rainbow can be used as bridges, as platforms, or as a weapon. You can shoot a rainbow at an enemy, you can trap it inside, or you can drop a rainbow on an enemy from above.</desc>

		<path>./Bushido Blade 2 (USA).chd</path>
		<name>Bushido Blade 2</name>
		<desc>Two samurai families who date back over eight hundred years have been feuding ever since the Gempei War, where the Kagami family sided with the Minamoto and ensured themselves a victory over their rivals, the Sue. Over the centuries since, the two families evolved into ninja clans, but their hatred of each other never faded. Now, in the 20th century, the Shainto, descendants of the Sue, are in a position to bring vengeance on the Narukagami. 

Bushido Blade 2 takes place sometime after the events in the original game and is also a weapon fighting game without health bars, power displays, or over-the-top special maneuvers. The game features the Story Mode, Versus Mode and Slash mode present in the original game as well as a new tournament mode, where the two sides face each other with shinai and other bamboo weapons in a kendo like ring. Fighters have different styles (including some with two sword nito and iaijutsu styles) and there are many weapons to choose from (although the hammer has been replaced with the yari spear). The controls have changed somewhat, but stances are still in the game, as are one-hit kills if blows strike a sensitive part of the body.

Initially players can choose from six warriors, three from each clan. As progress is made in the story mode, supporting characters will be encountered. If beaten, those characters will become available for play in the game's other modes.</desc>

At first, the purpose of the invasion is unknown, but to the horror of all surviving humans, the objective soon becomes clear: the aliens plan to harvest all non-radioactive carbon from planet Earth (thus the title C-12). nnnnMost of the human race has been decimated, and those captured alive are used for "droning," the process by which the aliens reprogram humans into cyborg warriors. nnnnIt is up to you, playing as resistance fighter Riley Vaughan, to save the Earth from impending doom. Armed with an imaging unit that has been implanted to replace his left eye, as well as a powerful arsenal of weapons, Vaughan must complete tasks, collect items, and destroy the enemy in order to carry out his missions and uncover the secrets behind the alien invasion. nnnnC-12: Final Resistance allows players to explore dynamic, darkly detailed environments that include more than 35 different missions and objectives.</desc>

		<path>./Carmageddon (Europe).chd</path>
		<name>Carmageddon</name>
		<desc>Motorized carnage.  Ever wanted to hit pedestrians during a race?  Now's your chance. Carmageddon is an ultra-violent racing game which caused much controversy during the '90s but was also very popular due to its fun factor. It was also one of the first batch of games to make use of 3D accelerated graphics (using OpenGL and 3dfx Voodoo cards).

At the beginning of the game the player only has one car and is ranked at #99. The overall objective is to race all the way to the top, collecting the opponents' cars on the way as trophies (and possibly replacements to his vehicle). In the race itself the player tries to damage opponents by driving into them, and can also kill pedestrians. Damage, kills and spectacular moves earn credits for the player which can be used for upgrades and even making repairs to the car at anytime during the race. If you wreck a certain car in 4 races or so, you get to drive it. There are many power-ups strewn around the courses which range from useful to fun to downright absurd. Though the player can win by racing fairly and normally, most players found it much more fun to wreck everything in sight.

Carmageddon is a violent game which is probably not suitable for minors.</desc>

		<desc>This Castlevania game was originally released on the Sharp X68000 (a home computer relatively unknown outside of Japan) but never made it to the worldwide audience. This conversion is meant to fix that, a remake of the original for the PlayStation with a good deal of new features.

This game plays very much like any old platform game on the NES (specifically, it plays just like an old Castlevania), you walk slowly forward killing any demonic creature you meet. The game is mostly sideways, though you can jump or walk onto the platforms here and there. The game plays like an old game, but looks like a new one with completely remade 2D graphics, with FMV cutscenes, arranged high quality music and more.</desc>

		<name>Chrono Trigger</name>
		<desc>What begins as a carefree day at the Millennial Fair for a young man named Crono turns into his ultimate adventure. When Crono meets a young girl named Marle, little does he realize that this young girl, his best friend Lucca's invention, and a mysterious pendant will thrust him into the ultimate trip through time and space, encountering new friends, defeating the forces of evil, and encountering the one who would destroy the flow of time.

Chrono Trigger is a role-playing game, with the usual game mechanics fare for such: the player takes control of a variably large party, developing the combat skills of its members and managing their equipment. As the characters grow in power, not only their ability scores increase, but they also learn new "Techs" - special powerful attacks and maneuvers which cost them "Magic Points" to use in battle. 

The game utilizes the ATB (active time battle) combat system from  Final Fantasy games - sort of a mix of turn-based and real-time combat -  adding to it combo attacks. Apart from normal Techs, it is possible to use Double and Triple Techniques - super-powerful attacks which involve two or three characters using their abilities at once. There are no random battles in the game, as all the enemies are visible on screen, and it's even possible to just pass by them entirely. 

The game allows you to face your ultimate adversary at different points of time, which leads to several different endings. There is also a New Game+ option, which allows you to carry over your powerful characters to a new game, and adds even more endings to the already existing ones.</desc>

Bassad has allied himself with an unknown alien entity for his bid to world domination. Ray Poward (returning from Contra: Hard Corps) is deployed to thwart Bassad's scheme along with three of the newest members of the Hard Corps team: Tasha, a female mercenary; CD-288, a robot; and Bubba, an alien. After making the way to Bassad's Mountain Stronghold, the team defeats him in his armored pod, but is dragged into his mind for a final battle. With Bassad defeated, they are teleported to the alien entity, which turns out to be a small living planet. With it destroyed, the team is drifted in space, and a surviving small alien bug is seen hiding.

Each character plays exactly the same except for the type of weapons they wield and their movement speed. All characters start with a machine gun and flamethrower, but the remaining two slots are for character specific weaponry. The game plays from an isometric angle. Since the game takes place in three dimensions, enemies come from all angles. Ducking and strafing have been added to the player's abilities, as well as an auto-aiming feature to help attack airborne enemies. Jumping has been slightly changed as the characters no longer do tightly curled somersault jumps (a feature in every previous game since the arcade version of the original Contra). The player's progress can be saved to a memory card.</desc>

		<desc>This is the 3rd in the Darkstalkers series (the 2nd, Night Warriors: Darkstalkers' Revenge, was published only for the Sega Saturn in the US.)  It plays much the same as the first, but features better animation, more playable characters, and a deeper storyline.

Jedah, the "Lord of Vampire", has summoned all of the Night Warriors to his realm to be assimilated into his being.  Of course, this serves as a great excuse to have more one-on-one fights...

Play as Jedah, B. B. Hood, Q-Bee, Lilith, Demitri, Morrigan, Anakaris, Victor, L. Raptor, Hsien-Ko, J. Talbain, Felicia, Rikuo, Sasquatch, Bishamon, Donovan, Pyron or Huitzil, and conquer the enemy.</desc>

Die Hard 1 is a third person shooter in a style similar to Tomb Raider.  You are John McClane and must fight through twenty floors of terrorists in the Nakatomi Plaza.  The game has an invisible wall effect which allows you to see John even in small hallways.

Die Hard 2 is a first person rail shooter in the vein of Virtua Cop or Mad Dog McCree.  Once again you take the role of John  McClane firing upon terrorists who happen to be ransacking the Washington/Dulles Airport in search of a South American dictator and druglord.

Die Hard 3 is a fast-paced taxi racer through the city.  John must this time speed through New York City defusing bombs and ramming evildoers off the road behind the wheel of a cab.</desc>

		<name>Dino Crisis</name>
		<desc>An abandoned research complex on a remote jungle island, a team of special forces operatives, a horde of vicious velociraptors, and one big, mean Tyrannosaurus rex constitute the setting and cast of Dino Crisis, the latest masterpiece from the makers of Resident Evil.
 Dr. Edward Kirk is supposed to be dead. Three years ago while working to establish a new type of energy technology code-named Third Energy, an experiment went awry and terminated the brilliant scientist's life -- or so it was thought. It was recently learned, however, that Dr. Kirk is very much alive and continuing his work at a Borginia Republic research facility on Ibis Island.
 In order to investigate the situation, an elite special forces team including agents Regina, Gail and Rick was sent. The three expected another routine mission, but what they got was an all-out fight for their lives against an enemy they surely had never been trained to face -- dinosaurs!
 Luckily, Regina isn't restricted to limited firepower, as she'll come across shotguns, dart guns, and other weapons throughout the island. To gain access to the keys, code disks, and ID cards necessary for continued exploration, Regina must solve a variety of puzzles.
 Dino Crisis has three possible endings with a great deal of secrets becoming available after each has been viewed. These include new weapons, new costumes, and a "Wipe Out" mode in which you must defeat a certain number of dinosaurs within a designated time period.</desc>

		<name>Dino Crisis 2</name>
		<desc>The research on the mysterious Third Energy is being continued in secret, but then an entire island with the facility conducting this research and a neighbouring town has vanished, moving back in time to the dinosaur era. A military unit is sent to the past to save the survivors and retrieve the research data. But nearly all soldiers are massacred by dinosaurs. You take control of Regina and Dylan, who managed to escape this fate. Now you must find the survivors, retrieve the data, and get back to your own time. 

Dino Crisis 2 is a third-person action-adventure game, where you control the characters Dylan and Regina (switching from one to another at various points in the storyline). You will collect items and use them to solve puzzles while fighting the hordes of dinosaurs that inhabit the island. Much like Alone in the Dark, the game uses 3d models for characters, enemies and items and static 2D backgrounds for their surroundings. 

Initially, each character starts with a gun and a melee weapon, but more weapons, such as flamethrowers or rocket launchers, can be bought later in the game. The dinosaurs' attacks cause you to lose "vitality", which can be restored using healing items. Sometimes an attack will cause you to bleed and thus slowly lose health; specific health items stop the bleeding. 

For each killed dinosaur you receive "Extinction Points". By killing a couple of dinos in quick succession, you activate a 'combo' and thus get more points. The points can be used in "Save Shops" throughout the game to buy weapons, ammo (and cartridge upgrades which allow you to store more ammo within the weapon), healing items and "tools" (such as armor, more powerful melee weapons, or "cards" which allow you to get bigger combos). You can also save the game at these points. 

While wandering around the island, you'll find many documents and letters to read, including "Dino Files", which contain a flavor description of a dino species.</desc>

		<name>Dune 2000</name>
		<desc>Dune 2000 is a remake of the classic Dune II updated for Windows. In this Real-Time Strategy game, you can play one of the three houses, the evil Harkonnen, the greed filled Ordos or the noble Atreides. Each has different sets of units and tactics while maintaining an overall balance.

Unlike the original, the cutscenes happen after every mission, with live-cast this time, already seen in Westwood Studio's Command &amp; Conquer franchise. A 16-bit color mode was the next step for their RTS genre, boosting up the graphics in Dune 2000.

Everything from the original is back - sandworms, the spice, the Fremen, the known structures and the map of the planet, even the intro cinematic is a 3D enhanced version of the original one.

Each house fights differently. The noble Atreides have air-superiority and rely on their honour and alliance with planet natives, the Fremen. The insidious Ordos rely on guerrilla tactics and superior technology, as well as mercenaries. The evil Harkonnen just go brutal, with no care for lives of their own troops or destruction as longs as they are victorious.

Unlike the Windows version, the PlayStation version of the game is fully 3D.</desc>

		<desc>In 2192, a new city, Selene, is built on the moon. Over the years, Selene grows larger, more powerful, and more independent of the Earth - to the point that the moon and Earth battle in a war that winds down without a definite victory for either side. In 2242, war breaks out again - the Earth slowly begins to win... except for the efforts of an experimental Selene technology known as Einhänders: flying machines with a "hand" that allows them to change weaponry mid-battle.

On December 12, 2245, Selene sends down 3 Einhänders in a last attempt to turn the tide of the war. You get to choose the craft to pilot, and it's up to you to battle your way through the Earth's monstrous defenses and win the battle.

The game is a traditional side-scrolling shooter, with rendered 3D backgrounds and enemies. The atmosphere of the game is very "industrial", down to the German industrial music playing in the background (think Einsturzende Neubauten mixed with Lords of Acid). The weapon-switching and claiming is an integral part of the game, as weapons have limited shots. This forces a bit more strategy than the usual button-mashing shooters inspire.</desc>

One or two players can assume the identities of these Elementals as they crusade for an unknown master toward a climactic battle.

		<desc>Final Fantasy Origins is a re-release of Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy II. Both games have added CGI cut scenes, updated graphics, and added content. It also includes art galleries of Yoshitaka Amano's illustrations. Final Fantasy II was never released in the USA.

Final Fantasy is an RPG/adventure came where you choose four characters (from six different character classes). It features turn based combat, kill monsters for gold / experience to advance levels and equipment. 

Final Fantasy II is also similar but has several different aspects. There is no experience system is not based off of killing monsters. The more you use a weapon/armor the more proficient you get at it. It also features a keyword system. During a conversion some words can be memorized then you can ask NPCs keywords to further the plot, get more information, etc.</desc>

		<desc>The Elemental Crystals...the life source of the planet. With them, gentle winds blow, the seas are active, fire burns bright, and the earth is full of life. All seems well in the world, until the wind suddenly stops, the sea begin to grow stagnant, the heat of fire becomes scarce, and the earth begins to wither. King Tycoon, sensing a premonition of evil, hurries off to check on the Wind Crystal, only to witness it destroy itself.

Meanwhile, a young traveler named Butz is camping in a field when a giant meteor strikes the planet. When he heads out to examine the meteor, he is shocked to find a young girl named Lenna, who is the princess of Tycoon, and a old man named Galuf, who is on a critical mission. Later, joined by Faris, a pirate captain, the foursome must travel the land in search of the destructor of the Crystals, and save the planet at any cost!

Final Fantasy V featured many new gameplay options and tactics, including an improved Job/Ability system (like in Final Fantasy Tactics), the return of the ATB (Active Time Battle) turn system, and all of the classic FF gameplay you've come to know and love!

Final Fantasy V was released as a stand-alone game in Japan, and again in Final Fantasy Collection. Its U.S. debut was as part of Final Fantasy Anthology. It was also later ported to the Gameboy Advance, adding 4 new Jobs, a new 30-floor dungeon, a bestiary, a music player, the ability to quick save anywhere, a few extra pieces of equipment, and a newly update translation.</desc>

Set in a fantasy world with a technology level equivalent to that of the Second Industrial Revolution, the game's story focuses on a group of rebels as they seek to overthrow an imperial dictatorship. The game features fourteen permanent playable characters, the most of any game in the main series. Final Fantasy VI was the first game in the series to be directed by someone other than producer and series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi; the role was filled instead by Yoshinori Kitase and Hiroyuki Ito. Yoshitaka Amano, a long-time contributor to the Final Fantasy series, returned as the image and character designer, while regular composer Nobuo Uematsu wrote the game's score, which has been released on several soundtrack albums.</desc>

		<name>Final Fantasy Tactics</name>
		<desc>Final Fantasy Tactics was a big move for the whole Final Fantasy franchise into different fields. Tactics combines traditional elements of the Final Fantasy series with a completely different game mechanics and battle system. It was the 1st game during Final Fantasy 32-bit era using a 3D, isometric, rotatable playing field, with bitmap sprite characters and a turn based strategy system.

In the game you build up a team by recruiting many available characters you meet during your travels and stocking up plenty of items, to defeat various enemies waiting on your path. The game features a very complex character class(job) system where each character begins his way with a job such as Squire or Chemist. Successfully participating in battles, characters can later select one of more advanced jobs, with a total of 19 to choose from. In addition there are certain monsters and computer controlled "guests" with their own jobs and special abilities available to learn. In total, over 400 abilities are available which leads to ultimate endless combinations!

The PSP version of game are mostly reiterates the original PSOne. For example, the visual presentation is almost a 1:1 copy of the original. It looks like PSOne version with zoomed-in camera to make it fit the PSP screen. However Square adds cel-shaded introduction movies and numerous animation sequences played after each chapter ends. Some maps were completely remade as well, but you still cannot skip event scenes.

Also PSP version features two new playable characters: Balthier, from Final Fantasy XII and Luso from Final Fantasy Tactics A2. Two new job classes also have been added - the completely new Onion Knight and the Dark Knight class which was available on the PSOne only after using a cheat code. There are two wireless multiplayer options available once you reach the world map (just go into a bar in any town). One is Coliseum (Versus Battle Mode), the second is Cooperative Challenge (team-mission).</desc>

		<name>Forsaken</name>
		<desc>Earth has been rendered largely uninhabitable by an explosion caused by a bungled experiment. Few would dare to brave its unstable and searing environments - only those determined to grab a little of its remaining gold. You are one of those, taking your hover-bike into disintegrating caverns for a few hours of dangerous work which, successful or not, will be your last.

Forsaken is a first-person shoot 'em up in which you have complete movement freedom in 3 dimensions, as you accelerate, swerve and strafe your craft, making for gameplay resembling Descent. Each level has a defined exit which must be reached within a tight time limit. The surrounding areas are collapsing around you, with spikes and turbine fans among your hazards. Be very aware of other craft out to take all you have, as they alter their approach based on your weaponry (from the 25 featured in the game) and past encounters. 

On the PC, multiplayer action can feature up to 12 human players. The Nintendo 64 version featured 4 player split-screen multiplayer, while the Playstation version has no multiplayer options.</desc>

Command a powerful Tactical Assault &amp; Combat X-1 mech walker (that can also transform into a sleek hovercraft) and battle through 12 levels, each culminating in a showdown with a large boss character. Fortunately for you, fourteen different weapons are available to help you teach "crime doesn't pay." Feeling a little lonely? If so, a friend can join the action in cooperative play!

An additional game mode, Precinct Assault, has also been included. Precinct Assault is a strategy game that involves two teams (red versus blue) in an all-out battle for supremacy. This mode can be played against the computer or another human. Future Cop: L.A.P.D. supports the Dual Shock Analog Controller to make you feel the gunfire, and progress can be saved using either one block of memory card space or a password.</desc>

		<desc>G-Darius revolves around a conflict between the humanoids of Amnelia and cyborg/chimera biovessels known as the "Thiima" (meant to mean simply "bringers of death"). The Thiima had been aroused by the Amnelian army's use of the weapon A.N. (All-Nothing) to annihilate the world Blazar, whom Amnelia had been at war with over jurisdiction over the moon Mahsah. Determined to protect their existence, and long ago programmed to protect the universe from just such threats as A.N., the Thiima swarmed on Amnelia. Although the armed forces were badly ravaged, Amnelian scientists and engineers were able to make use of both A.N. and reverse engineered Thiiman technology/life systems to create the Silver Hawk fighters. Ultimately, two pilots "Sameluck Raida and Lutia Feen" are chosen to perform a decisive attack on the main Thiima base: Kazumn, a satellite of the planet Darius.</desc>

		<path>./Gauntlet Legends (USA).chd</path>
		<name>Gauntlet Legends</name>
		<desc>For those unfamiliar with the original Gauntlet and its various home versions, the action involved fighting enemies such as ghosts, demons and sorcerers spawned from square structures called monster generators. An overhead perspective allowed players the freedom to explore the maze-like levels while still being able to see everything around them.

The object of each stage was simply to destroy the monsters in your path as you searched for the exit leading to the next level. Gauntlet Legends takes this simple formula and adds a new story, distinct worlds and even boss characters to fight. Of course, there are still treasure and potions waiting to be found as well as various traps that could spell disaster for even the heartiest of warriors.

In order to help you survive the later levels (Gauntlet Legends consists of over 30 stages), characters can earn experience points that will eventually translate into added strength, speed, armor and health. The story behind the game involves a jealous brother (Garm) of a noble wizard (Sumner) who decided to gather 13 Rune Stones in order to raise a demon.

Once the stones were placed on the floor of Sumner's tower, a hideous monster named Skorn was awakened and promptly consumed its new "master." As one of four intrepid adventurers, your goal is to travel through the worlds making up the Gauntlet Legends universe to defeat the evil demon Skorne and his various followers (a rather unsavory lot of Grunts, Ankle Biters, Suiciders, Bomb Throwers and Death).

To help you fight the good fight, you'll be able to find food, special weapons and power icons that can all be stored in your inventory and used whenever your character needs them. Some of the weapons include a three-way shot, fire breath and super shot, while the power-ups include super speed, invisibility and Anti-Death Power (which allows you to steal health from the normally invulnerable Death).</desc>

		<desc>Gran Turismo is fundamentally based on the racing simulator genre. The player must maneuver an automobile to compete against artificially intelligent drivers on various race tracks. The game uses two different modes: Arcade Mode and Simulation Mode (Gran Turismo Mode in PAL and Japanese versions). In the arcade mode, the player can freely choose the courses and vehicles they wish to use. Winning races unlocks additional cars and courses.

However, simulation mode requires the player to earn different levels of driver's licenses in order to qualify for events, and earn credits(money), trophies and prize cars by winning race championships. Winning one particular championship also unlocks a video and a few additional demonstration tracks. Money earned by winning championships can be used to purchase additional vehicles, and for parts and tuning of all vehicles.

Gran Turismo features 180 cars and 11 race tracks (as well as reversed versions). Two Honda del Sol cars from 1995 were included in the Japanese version, but were removed from the North American and European versions. They can be found in the North American version's code (and are unlockable via a GameShark cheat device). In addition to the hidden del Sols, there is also a 1967 Chevrolet Corvette and a 1998 Mazda Roadster exclusive to Arcade mode. The Corvette and Roadster can also be accessed via GameShark.</desc>

		<desc>In 22th century, the scientists, learning the ancient ways of magic, discovered a new technique that made it possible to create artificial beings by mixing the DNA of humans and animals. Those new creatures were called "gears". They had no will of their own and were destined to obey the humans forever. However, a gear named Justice was, for a mysterious reason, capable of disobeying the humans and making decisions of his own. He organized a rebellion of gears, that was later repressed by the knights of the Sacred Order, who put him in a prison. But recently, Justice broke free, and the Order organized a tournament to find out who is capable of hunting him down again. Among the main contestant is a man with unclear past, Sol Badguy, and his rival Ky Kiske, one of the most skilled knights of the order. The conditions of the tournament are, however, very strange. It is allowed to spill blood, and the first prize is also not very usual: any wish of the winner will be fulfilled...

This is a 2D fighting game, in which you can play as one of 10 very different kind of characters. There is a selection of fighters from Holy Order knights, Armed Air Force soldiers, Mafia members and mad scientists. Each character has his/her own storyline that will be fully revealed during the final showdown. In battles, you can charge up for special attacks, as well as perform Deathblow moves, which would kill the opponent instantly. You can either choose to finish the Arcade mode, challenge your friends to a Versus battle, or either train your skills out in the Training mode.</desc>

Three humans have managed to escape with their lives and now seek vengeance against the Serpent Rider Korax who remains in their world.

Like Heretic, Hexen is a fantasy game based on an enhanced DOOM engine. All of Heretic's innovations like vertical looking, flying, and the inventory system have been carried over. The new major changes this time around are three characters for the player to choose from and the level hub system. The characters are the Fighter, the Cleric, and the Mage. Each one has four unique weapons and different levels of speed and armor.

The hub system steps away from the traditional "single levels stringed along into episodes" system which had been carried over into the FPS genre from sidescrollers and made popular by Wolfenstein 3D. In Hexen's hub system each episode is still made up of interconnected levels, but most of the levels are connected to a single "hub" level through portals. There are also portals between some of the "spoke" levels. Many of the puzzles in Hexen require travel back and forth between different levels.

Other innovations in Hexen included weather effects, jumping, earth-quakes, and destructible objects such as trees and vases.</desc>

		<desc>Gameplay in the Jet Moto series differs traditional racing games, as players instead control hoverbikes which hover close above the ground and can be driven over both land and water. Most of the courses in the games are designed to take advantage of this ability. The game has a its variant of the traditional road course, but also introduces a new course type, known as a suicide course. Instead of being a continuous loop, these tracks have checkpoints at either end of the course, and the starting grid in the center. Characters race to one end, then turn around to head for the other checkpoint, repeating the process until all laps are complete. This provides a new gameplay dynamic as often the player must navigate oncoming traffic.[1] Characters are split into teams, and bikes are adorned with logos of products such as Mountain Dew and Butterfinger, similar to real-life sponsored racing.</desc>

		<name>Krazy Ivan</name>
		<desc>In the early 21st century, the Earth is under attack by aliens. In five areas of the planet, they have erected energy generators, creating a field that slowly encompasses the entire planet surface. They have also taken hundreds of humans prisoner. Someone has to stop them. Enter Russian Commander Ivan Popovich, nicknamed "Krazy Ivan". He is a paranoid schizophrenic, prone to burst out into violence at any time. In other words, he's perfect for the job.

The player controls Ivan's "Steel Cossack" power suit on the three-dimensional battlefields. In each of the five areas in the game, two kinds of enemies can be found: Drones and Sentients. Drones are smaller air and ground vehicles that often respawn. Sentients are mechs similar in size and capability to the Steel Cossack. Each of the Sentients must be eliminated before the energy field generator can be destroyed to complete the mission.

The Cossack is capable of carrying lots of weapons: projectile and energy guns, unguided and guided missiles, and other special weapons. Destroyed enemies reveal captured humans, to be rescued by Ivan, and power-ups, which recharge shields or rearm weapons.

After a successful mission, Ivan can upgrade the Cossack with more powerful weapons and replace the mech's armor.

Between the missions, rather humorous live-action cutscenes (starring English actors sporting thick Russian accents) continue the story.</desc>

		<path>./Legacy of Kain - Soul Reaver (USA).chd</path>
		<name>Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver</name>
		<desc>1500 years after Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain, the vampire Kain's decision at the end of that game has finally defeated the human kingdoms and brought the world of Nosgoth under his control. Ruling from a castle built on the Pillars of Nosgoth, Kain has established an empire of six vampire clans, each ruled by a lieutenant, the sons of Kain. Raziel was one such lieutenant, but lost his position through the "insolence" of receiving a new evolutionary "dark gift", the growth of feathery wings, before his master had acquired it. Fearing that Raziel might one day surpass him, Kain tears off Raziel's wings in a fit of range and banishes him into the Abyss.  There, Raziel is lost in time, died and his body consumed. The Elder God recovers Raziel's soul and rebuilds the broken body, not as a living vampire, but as a strange new creature of the underworld. Swearing revenge on Kain, Raziel now phases seamlessly between Nosgoth and it's underworld, using his new powers to become a terrible reaver of souls...

Soul Reaver is a 3rd person action-adventure title that follows Raziel on his quest to purge the land of vampires and take revenge on Kain and his brothers, leaders of the six clans. The player controls the game from behind Raziel's shoulder, moving him in any direction, climbing, attacking, jumping and using specific abilities. Raziel's can grip onto the edge of ledges and his torn wings allow him to glide gently downwards. Raziel can shift through the "material" world into the "spectral" realm at will... but must find specific locations in order to shift back. The two realms mirror one another, with distortions which give access to new areas and platforms. Existing in the material world drains Raziel's life energy at a constant rate.  Throughout the game, energy is recovered by consuming the souls of defeated enemies. If Raziel is able to defeat one of his brothers, he will additionally gain a new ability ("dark gift") upon drinking it's soul. Examples include: the ability to swim, file telekinetic projectiles or the ability to phase through locked gates. Raziel can arm himself with a variety of weapons including spears, daggers, swords, axes, as well as attacking enemies barehanded. Eventually, Raziel will also come across Kain's personal sword (named the Soul Reaver), and will use it to create a powerful energy blade weapon.

The world is left open to Raziel, he can return to areas previously completed and explore the world of Nosgoth at will. Access to certain areas however sometimes  requires the use of gained specific abilities. Many of the puzzles the player will need to solve in this quest are "block puzzles", requiring the placement of certain large structures (usually square blocks), either to activate switches or to build access to out-of-reach areas.</desc>

In Legend of Mana you control a hero or heroine traveling over the land of FaDiel. The game features a land creation system, allowing you to create new locations and story elements by placing mysterious artifacts. Those ancient artifacts are repositories of the land´s long-forgotten memories and the many events that once took place there. As the game advances, you will receive more artifacts and find out more about the land. At home you can raise pet monsters and create powerful golems, forge mighty weapons or refine musical instruments. On your adventures you can meet various interesting characters and fight against gruesome monsters.

The game is extremely non-linear in terms of gameplay. You can explore areas in any order and play through 67 related scenarios. Eventually you will resurrect the Mana Tree and discover the Legend of Mana.</desc>

But it's so much more than that. Incidentally, it is also Creative Reality's last game. Sharing the same team and the same writer than Dreamweb, it comes as no surprise that the game heavily relies on writing and puzzles. This reliance (and a few more things) makes Martian Gothic: Unification a title to look back at.</desc>

Join either the Wolf Clan or the Jade Falcon Clan as they pursue their own agenda against the Inner Sphere and other Clans. Take your advanced Omnimechs into battle against all comers. Win high warrior ratings (by using less mechs or smaller mechs than needed, completing secondary objectives, etc.) and you'll get chance at a promotion trial where you face superior odds in an arena. If you win, you advance in rank. If you are very successfully, you can make it all the way up to Khan, leader of the Clan!

Mechwarrior II was developed in-house by Activision as the successor to their original Mechwarrior. While this time there are no dynamic campaign and mercenary actions, the Clan culture is integrated into the two campaigns. Different clans have different mechs and different rules, even different weapons. You can customize your mechs in order to use less than the "par" force in order to get a higher rating. The full 3D environment wasn't pretty as this was before the 3D accelerators made their debut, but it's still better than anything that came before. Let addition of NetMech allowed users to fight each other online. When 3D cards came along, special versions were created to take advantage of 3D texturing. While not QUITE as replayable as Mechwarrior, it's nonetheless a classic.</desc>

		<name>Medievil 2</name>
		<desc>16, May 1886
 There will be many stories concerning the events that took place in 1886 or as most have come to call it, the Autumn of Death. They have all been dismissed as mere hallucinations, the prattling of drunks or some stage of a sickness. I know better. I was there.
 That night the dead rose from the graves, demons stalked the Great Museum and even mummies walked among the living. Everyone saw a skeletal knight vanquishing all the horrid beasts. I spoke to him. I even aided him in his quest to destroy Lord Palethorn of Shoreditch. It's all true. Every word of it! Below is what I was able to uncover about our knight in placid bone. Read closely and heed my words.
 I found an old legend about a mighty knight, whose name I now know to be Sir Daniel Fortesque, that starts around the 13th century. He was a mighty warrior from the land of Gallowmere, now too a legend. He was slain in battle against the insane wizard, Zarok. Unfortunately, Sir Dan's death was for nothing. Zarok lived on and soon came into possession of a book of dark magic.
 Several years passed before Zarok finally deciphered the spell he was looking for. It is written that with this book of dark magic, Zarok awoke the dead to use them in an army. He was delighted and mad with power, so mad that he never realized that the spell worked all too well.
 As the legend goes, Sir Dan arose from his eternal sleep and took up the task he died trying to complete. After defeating all the roving minions of the damned and dead, he finally met Zarok face to face. It was an epic battle of might and magic but in the end, Sir Dan completed his knightly quest started several years before. With Zarok dead, Sir Dan hid the magic book and returned to his eternal rest.
 Now, some 500 years later, I witnessed Sir Dan awaken again. This time it was by the megalomaniac Lord Palethorn of Shoreditch. He was a man from the wrong side of the rails. He even bought a title to make himself feel more important. However, the society elite never really excepted him. That is when he turned to the book of dark magic and cast a spell to raise the dead. He wanted to destroy all of England and become its sole ruler.
 At first sight of Sir Dan I was sick to my stomach. One eye, no skin, he was hideous and a bit angry. I felt badly for Sir Dan, but I was extremely excited by the prospect of having him on my side. Being an older gentleman, I was not fit enough to do battle. My expertise is in the sciences and I know a bit of magic.
 Once this was all over, I bade Sir Dan farewell. I pray I never get to see him again in my lifetime. I pray that my ancestors will never have to see him in theirs. I knew they would deny it all. I can only pray that who so ever finds this believes me. I know not where Sir Dan placed the accursed book and that is probably for the best. I only hope its evil is gone for good. Believe in monsters, it may save us all some day.
 -- From the Private Diaries of Professor Hamilton Kift
 In Medievil II by Sony, you once again you play as Sir Dan. This time, instead of facing a mad sorcerer from your day, you must take on the modern world, modern 19th century that is. Using all the weapons at your disposal, you must help Professor Hamilton as he tries to figure out how to undo the damage being done by Lord Palethorn.
 Along the way, you will meet a helper ghost named Winston. He was raised by the kindly Professor and will give you tips from time to time. You must also collect treasure, keys and books to help in your quest. You'll need to buy certain items and ammo as well as read up on the enemy.
 There are, of course, the standard medieval weaponry like the sword, hammer and axe, along with different sizes of shields. There is also one modern weapon, the gatling gun. Along with the weapons you find, be sure to vanquish all your enemies and get the Chalice of Souls. Bringing this cup back to the Professor will prove to be very beneficial to Sir Dan.
 You also get to do things only the dead can do. Like putting your head on some of the creepy free-roaming hands that are moving about the Great Museum. Why would you want to do that? Why, to do some recon and get into those hard to reach places of course. Without revealing too much, your head will be placed on another body by the good Professor so you can stand a "fighting" chance against a certain enemy.</desc>

		<name>Mega Man Legends</name>
		<desc>In a world covered almost entirely in water, there exist small islands that hide huge treasures. And where there's treasure, you can find treasure hunters called Diggers, who live for the thrill of the hunt...

Barrel Casket was once one of the greatest Diggers, but he has now retired. He now cares for his young granddaughter, Roll, whose parents disappeared while on a dig. He had also discovered a strange baby boy in some ruins one time, who he also took under his care alongside Roll. He named the baby boy Rock Voulnut, and Rock grew up to be an expert Digger, sometimes known by his nickname, MegaMan.

While out exploring one day, Rock, Roll, and Barrel's airship, the Flutter, crash lands on an island named Kattelox. As they explore Kattelox in hopes of fixing their ship, they hear word of a huge treasure, the legendary Mother Lode, that is buried somewhere on the island. Rock, Roll, and Barrel decide to look for the treasure, but at the same time, they're going to get a little competition from a pirate family named the Bonnes...

Mega Man Legends is the first of the Mega Man series to take place in fully explorable 3D, and is paced more like an RPG than the previous stage-to-stage action games. Rock can explore the town and follow the story to find entrances to the underground ruins, where in he will find traps, feral Reaverbots, and large boss robots. Destroying enemies will reward Rock with health, sub-weapon energy, and the power cores of the robots, which people in his world use as currency. By searching through the town and ruins Rock will find items of dubious use and value, and they can be brought back to Roll to be assembled into useful items and upgradable sub-weapons, although not for free. Rock can run while shooting, go into first person mode for aimed shots, and also lock onto an enemy and circle around them to avoid their attacks.</desc>

The Blue bomber and his teammate, Roll, must journey to a distant island to recover The Mother Lode, an item that no-one really understands, but that they all believe may hold the key to make their dreams come true, and so everyone is after it. 

Unlike past Mega Man titles, Legends 2 also adds RPG elements into the mix, allowing players to talk to villagers and the like. Some may help in finding items, others aid the player with important information about The Mother Lode, and other areas on the island.</desc>

		<name>Metal Gear Solid : VR Missions</name>
		<desc>A semi-sequel/prequel to the highly acclaimed Metal Gear Solid (MGS), Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions puts you once again in control of the top-level FoxHound field specialist, Solid Snake. This time around, instead of fighting genetically engineered soldiers and saving the world from Metal Gear, you're in a combat simulator. Aboard the Discovery (the submarine that Solid Snake traveled upon before reaching Angel Island), you will prepare for the dangers ahead.

For those that have yet to experience MGS, the gameplay is based around strategy, tactics and action. Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions's interface and concept is similar to its predecessor, but is based on the simulator game mode that was included in MGS. This time, instead of just a few missions, you have nearly 150 different stages to play (300 including the Time Attack modes). Fans of MGS should be able to quickly pick up on the gameplay style. In fact, not only is the gameplay recognizable by fans of the original Metal Gear Solid, each of the missions (although similarities are sometimes minute) are based on events that occurred in MGS.</desc>

Yep, he would have been content to rest on his laurels after rescuing ninety-nine of his Mudokon buddies from extermination in Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee, but a group of disgruntled ghosts elected good ol' Abe to avenge their deaths.
 What's a Mudokon to do? Well, use your wits, words, and wiles to infiltrate the Soulstorm Brew factory, and get you and your buddies out alive, of course. Sound easy? Didn't think so. Each room, fully rendered in charming 2D, is brimming with booby traps and armed guards. What's more, it's tougher to get your enslaved buddies' attention this time. Mudokons now come in six different flavors: "normal" (that's a laugh), wired, depressed, sick (drunk, actually), and blind.
 Depending on the individual's physical or emotional state, you've got to interact with him in a particular way to get him to respond to Abe. To compensate for this, the development team at GT Software has beefed up their trademark "GameSpeak" feature. Abe is now capable of eight different utterances, including: "work!" "all o' ya!" "sorry," and a couple of unintelligible grunts and growls. And, yes, Abe still farts, although it's not absolutely necessary to do so.</desc>

		<name>Omega Boost</name>
		<desc>For centuries the intelligence known as AlphaCore has been growing inside of human computer networks, slyly and invisibly pushing humanity to build more of it and allow it to control more of the network. On the eve of AlphaCore's complete assimilation of all technology, humanity becomes aware of it, and rather than bow down to it as king, as it expected, they attempt to purge it from the network. In response AlphaCore defends itself, locking all of humanity out of their technology and assuming total control of their weapons. Not long after this AlphaCore learns of a desperate plot: to build a time machine and travel back in time to remove AlphaCore's influence from humanity. AlphaCore steals this technology and hatches its own plan: traveling back in time to 1945 and inserting itself into the first computer ever built, ensuring that humanity would forever be subtle pawns in its machinations. It now falls upon the shoulders of Lester J. Henning, pilot of the experimental robot weapon Omega Boost, to travel back in time, stop AlphaCore's plan, and restore free choice to humanity.

The Omega Boost flies through levels on a predetermined path, although it can brake and boost in a direction to avoid hazards. The Omega Boost can fire a Vulcan rifle at enemies without targeting, or can lock on to and attack many targets at once with a homing laser. By scoring well in levels, the Omega Boost will gain the ability to lock onto more targets at once, and eventually unlock the Viper Boost, a powerful area attack that must cool down after being used. Levels completed in campaign mode can be replayed at your leisure in Zone mode, and bonus levels can be unlocked as well by achieving certain milestones.</desc>

		<name>Pandemonium!</name>
		<desc>The young sorceress Nikki, the court jester Fargus, and his side-kick Sid the puppet are the three main protagonists of this 3D platform game. While attending a "Wizards in Training" seminar, Nikki accidentally casts a powerful magic spell, which results in a giant monsters swallowing the whole village. The three friends must now travel to a place called "Wishing Engine", and be granted a wish to revert the world back to normal.

The characters each have a special movement to kill enemies with. The game uses floating camera angles through a vast Prince of Persia-style world. The goal of the game is to clear the various levels, avoiding spikes and enemies and collecting coins for extra lives.

Unlike most 3D platformers, Pandemonium offers only two-dimensional movement, rather than complete freedom of movement. The characters move along a curving 2D course within a 3D environment.</desc>

		<name>PaRappa the Rapper</name>
		<desc>The rapping pup, PaRappa, dreams of impressing his friend, the beautiful Sunny Funny, and going out on a date with her.  But what he lacks is confidence - help PaRappa rap his way through learning Kung Fu, a driving test, cooking and more, all in order to get the girl.  And remember - You Gotta Believe!

PaRappa the Rapper is a game based on lyrics, music and rhythm.  The game itself is very basic - each stage has a 'teacher', that PaRappa must follow.  You'll see the teacher say some lyrics, and then PaRappa must copy the teacher by pressing the appropriate buttons to repeat those lyrics back.  Rap well, and you'll be able to continue; fudge up the lyrics, and the music will start to distort and the teacher will become displeased.  Continue to mess up and you'll fail the stage.

Of course, the goal is not to copy the teacher, but instead to outperform them - you can do this by improvising in the song's gaps.  Listen to how the song goes, and improvise in time to the music; if you perform well enough, the teacher will step aside, leaving you to freestyle on your own!

The PSP version of the game is a remake of the PlayStation original.  However, it includes a few upgrades, such as a 16:9 display, sharper graphics, game sharing, multiplayer support of up to four players, and the addition of song remixes, which can be downloaded via the internet onto your Memory Stick Duo.</desc>

		<path>./Parasite Eve (USA).m3u</path>
		<name>Parasite Eve</name>
		<desc>An ordinary day in New York for rookie police officer Aya Brea. Christmas Eve is the present day, and you've decided to visit the opera theater. Now this is where the fireworks begin. Suddenly audience members are set on fire, toasted completely, and it appears that the lead vocal is the source of this burning terror. Yet you appear to be immune, and as a police officer you're always on duty, so you must confront the danger.

There has to be some connection between the two of you, as that seems the only rational explanation. What if mitochondria are a species on its own, more advanced then humankind, and using them only to create environments and civilization for themselves? What if humankind are just hosts? What if mitochondria are the natural enemy of humankind? That would make Aya their natural enemy, so the battle for survival and uncovering the truth has already started.

The game is played over six days, each day bringing its own quest. Environments range from Central Park and the American Museum of Natural History to a police office and hospital, all of them modeled like realistic places and most of them crawling with bloodthirsty mutant animals. Combat is different from traditional RPGs, as while you still take turns attacking and/or using parasite powers, you'll be able to run across the battlefield and dodge enemy fire or even strike from a better angle or behind. As Aya levels up she will gain access to parasite powers, such as healing or supercharging a bullet with energy. These powers will deplete a recharging energy bar, although the bar will recharge slower the longer combat drags on. Aya will find many guns of various types throughout the game, and every gun can be modified with extra stats, either with special items, or by breaking down another gun to move over its bonus stats or special effects. The same is true for armor Aya finds.</desc>

		<desc>Aya Brea is back in a new game. This time there are fewer RPG elements than the first game, and the game plays more like Resident Evil. Battles are now in real-time, and a new range of weapons are available. Defeating enemies rewards money as well as points used to revive and power-up Aya's suppressed Parasite powers, like healing and igniting foes. Weapons and armor now have fixed stats, but attachments can be swapped in and out of them to modify their properties.

After surviving the events of Parasite Eve Aya left her job as a cop and became a member of MIST (Mitochondrion Investigation and Suppression Agency) in order to hunt down the remnant mutants spawned by Eve's awakening. In the year 2000 a new breed of Neo Mitochondrion takes over the Akropolis Tower in downtown LA. Aya is called in and uncovers a secret organization that threatens all humanity.</desc>

Since worlds that have any kind of development are off limits for corporate planetary development, Terracom is hiring Terran and alien soldiers through a directive known as "Project Overkill" to "unpopulate" desirable locations.
In response, a corporate leak has hired mercs to fight against the injustice of Terracom with the ultimate goal: destroy "Project Overkill."

Take on the role of four ruthless mercs as you rack up the body count through over 50 different missions with multiple paths.  One of the earlier releases for the Playstation, Project Overkill uses a 3D rendered, 3/4 perspective to deliver loads of blood-drenched mayhem.</desc>

Rayman embarks on strange quest to save the Great Protoon and his tiny followers from the evil Mister Dark. Since the land relies on the Great Protoon to maintain balance and harmony, the planet is now in chaos. Guide Rayman across 70 cartoon-like levels while facing over 50 bizarre baddies trying to put the limbless hero out of commission.
 Along the way, you must attempt to free singing creatures called Electoons from their cages. Don't expect a walk in the park, however. The enemies have been designed to learn your playing style in order to defeat you. Acquire new moves and abilities as you progress through the world, and return to earlier levels to find hidden secrets. Rayman offers CD-quality sound effects and music, vibrant vistas featuring 65,000 colors, and four layers of independently scrolling backdrops. A memory card with two blocks of free space is required to save progress.
 Features:
 * Help Rayman rescue the Electoons
 * Includes 70 levels and more than 50 characters
 * Graphics feature 65,000 colors and independently scrolling backgrounds
 STORY:
 Embark on a strange quest to save a world's Great Protoon and rescue little Electroons from imprisonment. You see, the world of Rayman relies on the Great Protoon to maintain balance and harmony for every living creature.
 The problem is that the evil Mister Dark has decided to capture him (it?) to throw the planet into chaos. This is where you come in! Guide Rayman through 70 cartoon-like, side-scrolling levels facing over fifty bizarre characters trying to put you out of commission.
 Along the way, free the Electroons who have been forced into cages by the baddies. Don't expect a walk in the park, however. The enemies will actually learn your playing style in order to defeat you! Acquire new moves and abilities as you progress through the world and return to earlier levels to find hidden secrets. Rayman also features CD-quality sound effects and music, 65,000 colors, plus four layers of independently scrolling backdrops to mesmerize you while playing. Don't just stand there gawking, the Great Protoon awaits!
 GAMEPLAY:
 The Rayman character is perfect for little children, though this game is easily difficult enough for adults. 60 levels for Rayman to conquer and none of them is easy, not even the first levels, because you have to get used to controlling Rayman.
 Sometimes the difficulty can be quite annoying, but luckily, if you get by a clown holding a camera and let him take your picture, you can save your progress in a level. On the world map there's also points where you can save after completing a level, it doesn't take much space in you system memory. A problem is, that when you completed all levels in the game, you still haven't beaten mister Dark.
 To get to this final level you must find each of the six cages of Electoons in each of the 60 levels. So if you can't find one cage, completing the game is impossible. A very good thing in the game is that the further you get in the game, the more abilities you get. For example, Rayman can hang on an edge, helicopter, use his glove to beat enemies, that sort of thing.</desc>

		<desc>Rayman 2: The Great Escape is an action-adventure video game developed by Ubi Soft Montpellier.

Rayman 2 takes place in a world called the Glade of Dreams, and revolves around its invasion and occupation by an armada of interstellar Robo-Pirates, led by Admiral Razorbeard. Prior to the invasion, the Robo-Pirates destroyed over one hundred planets in the galaxy, with the intention of enslaving their inhabitants. Upon the invasion of the Glade of Dreams, the Robo-Pirates were battled against by Rayman, Globox, and other allies. After some battles, Rayman's capture occurs after the explosion of the Primordial Core. Ly the Fairy telepathically communicates with Rayman explaining the consequences of the damage, with the core's shattering into 1000 Yellow Lums, and the capture of many fighters. Rayman's powers are also lost due to this, and he finds himself captured by the Robo-Pirates at the beginning of the game.</desc>

It featured the same game engine, and even the game menus are the same, although it is a game engine with slightly improved graphics. Four characters from the original game are also in Re-Loaded, such as Mamma, Bounca, Butch, and Cap'n Hands. Vox, however, is not present in the game and is replaced by two new female characters: a pink-haired, cannibalistic sex symbol named The Consumer, and a malfunctioning android nun named Sister Magpie. Via cheat code, Sister Magpie can unlock hidden character Fwank from the previous game for use in Re-Loaded. If unlocked, Fwank is the best character in Re-Loaded, with the most speed and best armour. All of the returning characters have new weapons and/or variations of their costumes. There are twelve blood-soaked new worlds to annihilate, much bigger than the levels encountered in the previous game, and with the added bonus of being able to morph the surrounding terrain with high-powered weaponry and explosives.</desc>

		<name>Re-Volt</name>
		<desc>For years, the Toy-Volt company has been producing toys and games for children all over the world. Within months of introducing their first products, Toy-Volt shot to the top! No one could put their finger on exactly what it was that made the toys so popular. Sure, they employed the best designers and marketers in the world, but there was something else about Toy-Volt toys, something almost.... magic. Now, their newest R/C cars really start to live! 

Re-Volt is a racing game where you take control over one of more than 28 R/C cars and drive on one of the 13 tracks. The tracks are varied, and include a toy shop, a supermarket, a luxury liner and more. It is possible to play a "reversed" (backwards) or "mirror" (reversed left and right) variety of each track. There are also 4 levels of realism to choose from. 

There are a couple of single- and multiplayer game modes to choose from. There's a Single Race, where you complete a single track while competing with several computer-controlled opponents; a Championship, where you try to complete a series of races in hopes of finishing on the top; and Multiplayer, where you play with live opponents. There's also a Time Trial, where you're alone on the track, and simply try to get as best a time as possible; a Practice mode, where you're free to drive around a track to learn its structure and shortcuts; and the Stunt Arena, where you drive around a special arena and try to collect stars situated in hard-to-reach places. 

In Single Race, Championship and Multiplayer there are power-ups scattered throughout the track; picking them up gives you a one-use random power, such as missiles to launch at pesky opponents, a star to temporarily freeze competitors in place or a lightning bolt, which makes your car shock opponents nearby to make them stop.</desc>

		<desc> After receiving a distress call from the Bravo Team, an elite group from S.T.A.R.S (Special Tactics And Rescue Squad) flew into the desolate Raccoon City. Apparently, the team had uncovered something concerning the Umbrella corporation -- a biotech research company. But then, without warning, the Bravo Team vanished into thin air.
 Upon landing in the small city, the members of S.T.A.R.S began to investigate. They heard some strange noises coming from the surrounding woods and realized the sounds were getting closer. Scared, they took off running and kept on until they came to a large, ominous mansion. Seeking safety they entered, locking the door behind them. Their adventure had just begun.</desc>

Zan, the main character wields the weapons of both of his trades... the Sword of a Samurai master, and the six-shooter pistol of an American cowboy. He'll need a variety of techniques to defeat the Jackal Clan and avenge his own lost battle. Zan proceeds through enemies and challenges in each level to eventually reach the boss who he then battles in some form of specialized combat or pattern. Once the boss is defeated, Zan gets the chance to unleash as much punishment on his foe in 30 seconds as he can; higher damage values will change the finishing move he uses to slay his foe.</desc>

The first in a series about a mysterious town of the same name, Silent Hill generated a direct sequel, three indirect sequels, a prequel and a film adaptation. The game was included in Sony's Greatest Hits and Platinum Range of budget titles as a result of strong sales. A reinterpretation of the game was developed for the Wii, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable.
The plot focuses on Harry Mason as he searches for his daughter, Cheryl, who has disappeared following a car accident which left Harry unconscious. He finds Silent Hill to be largely abandoned, shrouded in a thick fog, snowing out of season, filled with monsters and being over taken by a hellish otherworld. As Harry scours the town, he begins learning about the history of Silent Hill and stumbles upon a cult ritual undertaken to bring a god to Earth.</desc>

		<name>Silverload</name>
		<desc>SilverLoad is the title of a graphic adventure video game produced by Vic Tokai in 1996. In this single-player game, you control, via a first person perspective, a Wild West cowboy as he ventures into a haunted town in order to save two children that were taken from their parents.

The U.S. based Entertainment Software Ratings Board gave the game a "M" rating for its graphic violence, blood and gore, and bits of profanity. The game was released for the personal computer in Europe, and the original PlayStation edition was given an international release.

As is the case with other graphic adventure games, progress in SilverLoad involves finding and interacting with various "hot spots" in order to pick up objects, solve puzzles and interact with (or kill) the various characters in the town. Picking up certain objects will cause the game's (and town's) clock to move forward, and thus, the trick to success is to pick up the right items in the precise order. Otherwise, you have to restart the game from the beginning, or from wherever you saved the game.</desc>

You assume the role of Archer, who has to defend his world against an invasion of the commandos. You can run, jump, climb ledges and fight using a blaster.

There are three different characters that can be played as, each with their own weapon and fighting style. Various magic scrolls can be found by defeating enemies which allow the player to cast several different types of spells including lightning and fire.

The story itself concerns an evil being who sets out looking for a Power Stone and cuts down all in his path with his sword, the Sol Divide. It is up to you to stop him, battling your way through several stages in both Arcade and Original Mode (which contain different areas and require different tactics to beat, the Original Mode being designed as a more difficult experience for players who want to progress on to a higher challenge).

Defeating enemies rewards the player with different items to help them on their journey, including the aforementioned magic scrolls, healing potions, magic bottles (only when playing Arcade Mode) and protection accessories (if playing Original Mode).</desc>

		<desc>In the 16th century, a sword surfaces that is so powerful, so evil that warriors from all over the globe seek it out. It is Soul Edge, a demon blade. From America to Europe to Japan, these warriors fight each other for the chance to obtain it. Soul Blade is a 3D weapons fighting game that chronicles their story.

A complete 3D fighting game that allows for side steps, Soul Blade has twelve colorful fighters (ten standard, two hidden, plus additional costumes for a few fighters), each with various weapons and styles. The first ten can be used in all the combat modes, while the hidden two can only be used in versus and arcade mode.

Namco enhanced the arcade version (called Soul Edge) by adding a well done CGI intro, plus a story mode to the addition of the traditional team, survival, and time attack modes. The story mode goes into greater detail about each character, and is presented in an ancient book format. The story mode also allows you to unlock more of each characters' extra weapons. These weapons, which vary in lengths, stats, and durability, add to the options available players in the versus mode.

Soul Blade's sequel is SoulCalibur, both in the arcades and for the Sega Dreamcast</desc>

		<name>Space Jam</name>
		<desc>Based on the movie of the same name, Space Jam centres around an invasion of Looney Tunes land by tiny aliens. The fate of the Tunes is to be decided by a basketball game, and for this the aliens turn into the huge, evil Monstars.

The game is about two thirds basketball sim and then minigames are stuck in to fill all the gaps. You can play as the Monstars or the Looney Tunes who have the help of Michael Jordan. The basketball games themselves come in two flavours, two-on-two and three-on-three.

Successful completion of the minigames upgrades your character's abilities on the court. There are several - one involves finding MJ's basketball togs, one is a space race in the style of the retro Micro Machines games. There are about five minigames in all, and a player from both teams participates.

The multiplayer is a big aspect of the game. There is the traditional two-player versus, one team Tunes, one team Monstars, and there is also co-operative mode. In this two or even three players can play on the same team. Using multitaps, you can actually have a three-on-three game.

The Tunes roster is made up of Michael Jordan, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Lola Bunny, Taz, Foghorn Leghorn, Pepé Le Pew, Sylvester, Wile E. Coyote, Porky Pig, Elmer Fudd and Yosemite Sam. The Monstars have access to Pound, Bupkus, Bang, Blanko and Nawt.

There are three statistics in the game, namely Speed, Shooting and Rebounds. These are pretty self-explanatory, but there is another more subtle one that's similar to stamina. Throughout the course of play your characters will get tired and lose their focus. A successful slam dunk usually tops this up.

The closest thing the game has to a single player mode is the Intergalactic Tournament (though it can be played multiplayer). This is a series of five matches in a row. One captain is picked and plays every game, while the rest of the team is substituted in and out.

There is no real way to progress in the game as it does not support memory cards. Space Jam has more of an arcade, lighthearted feel to it.</desc>

Players earn awards and promotions for successfully completing the 16 missions, with scores based on factors such as reconnaissance and intelligence recovered, rescue of hostages, enemies killed, and demolition. Ten ranks can be achieved, ranging from Private E1 to Sergeant Major and, depending on success, six decorations and medals can be earned, including The Purple Heart, Bronze or Silver Stars and the Congressional Medal of Honor.

After its limited success it spawned many rehashes, pseudo-sequels, and mission packs all bearing the same name. The Playstation's version of the rehash is Spec Ops: Stealth Patrol. Up to two players can simultaneously play through the series of missions the game has to offer. If there's only one player the second ranger is controlled by the CPU. The single player can switch between both rangers at any time, letting the CPU control the other ranger.

Join one of the most elite military task forces in the world--the U.S. Army Rangers. Play as a U.S. Special Operations Ranger Corps soldier in this third-person shooter. Your main objective: neutralize hostile terrorist threats around the world. With guns blazing or silently under the cover of darkness, navigate your team across harsh terrains of thick jungle, barren desert, arctic tundra, and dense forest. You must use stealth and tactics to your advantage. Oh, a few more squad members and weapons that range from sniper rifles to machines guns wouldn't hurt either. Take out terrorists, rescue hostages and save the free world...that's all this game is asking of you. Will you be able to complete your mission, even though you may be the lone survivor?</desc>

		<desc>Spider-Man is the first 3D game to star the popular web-slinger.  It is loosely based on Spider-Man: The Animated Series and Spider-Man Unlimited and features some of the voice cast from each and similar character designs.

Peter Parker is attending a demonstration of the reformed Dr. Otto Octavius's new invention when an imposter Spider-Man steals the device.  Spider-Man must work to clear his name and uncover the sinister motives behind the device's theft.

This game features appearances not only by most major Spider-Man characters, but cameos by numerous other characters from the Marvel Universe, such as the Human Torch, Punisher, Daredevil and Captain America.

Spider-Man's webs are greatly emphasized.  He can use them both for navigational purposes, like swinging or ziplining, and for offensive and defensive combat, such as tying up a villain, coating his fists with web for extra oomph, or building a protective shield.  His web supply is limited though and he must find new cartridges or risk running out.  The wall-crawling powers are also prominently features.  Spider-Man can cling to any wall or ceiling.  This is used for basic environmental navigation and for stealth as there are many sequences where you crawl over the heads of unsuspecting thugs, or drop down and catch them off-guard.

Combat is based around Spider-Man's ability to jump, kick, punch and web.  By combining these with direction and in various combinations, Spider-Man is able to throw objects such as furniture, hurl web balls, yank enemies into melee range and follow up with a flurry of hits, among other things.  There are a number of boss-battles as well, all of which are puzzle-based.

Missions vary from the fairly common fight-your way-to-the-goal or find-the-key-that-unlocks-the-door types to races to catch some or evade them or just trying to avoid the police.

There are several side goals in addition the main mission including multiple unlockable Spider-Man costumes and numerous hidden comic book covers to find.</desc>

		<name>Spider-Man 2 - Enter: Electro</name>
		<desc>Spider-Man 2 - Enter: Electro is the second PlayStation game to feature Spider-Man, and also serves as the sequel to the 2000 video game Spider-Man. This game follows Spider-man as he attempts to stop his old enemy Electro from obtaining a source of power called the Bio-Nexus Device. Game bosses included Hammerhead, Lizard, Sandman, Shocker and the exclusive charged-up Hyper-Electro.

This sequel to Activision's 2000 multi-platform Spider-Man release features the title villain in a diabolical scheme to construct a device that will amplify his strange electricity-based powers and make him virtually unstoppable. Players take the role of their friendly neighborhood Spider-Man to foil Electro's plan before it's too late. Movement and camera angles are similar to those of the first Spider-Man game, though Spidey has a few new web-slinging abilities in this title and is challenged by some sophisticated puzzle-solving and complex action sequences. Once again, Marvel Comics' legendary Stan Lee provides narration for this adventure.</desc>

		<desc>Spyro the Dragon is a platform game developed by Insomniac Games for the PlayStation. It stars the title character, a young purple dragon named Spyro and his dragonfly friend, Sparx, and is the first game in the Spyro the Dragon series. The first game was massively popular at its initial release and Spyro would later become one of the most recognizable, popular and respected gaming icons for the PlayStation gaming console. Spyro's best friend, Sparx the dragonfly, acts like the player's health meter and assists in gathering gems. The various dragons Spyro unfreezes along the way are also key characters in Spyro's progression through the game. Gnasty Gnorc is the main antagonist, who froze all the dragons of the land in crystal.</desc>

		<name>Star Wars : Dark Forces</name>
		<desc>Kyle Katarn is a former Imperial officer turned mercenary, now hired by the Rebel Alliance. After having stolen the Death Star plans from a remote facility, he is tasked with investigating the sudden destruction of a hidden Rebel base. This leads him to face off against Imperial General Rom Mohc and the various iterations of his "Dark Troopers" - cybernetic soldiers with the armor and firepower to turn the tide of the war.

Dark Forces is a close prequel to the original Star Wars movie trilogy. The game marks LucasArts' first attempt to enter the first-person shooter market. Instead of licensing the Doom engine, like many competitors, LucasArts created its own internal "Jedi" engine. The Jedi engine contains advanced features over similar tech, including the ability to look up and down, jump, crouch, and limited support (in the build used for Dark Forces) for rooms (sectors) over rooms. 3D models also make occasional appearances inside the game, as turrets or Kyle's ship dropping him off or picking him up from each mission.</desc>

		<desc>In a future ruled by tyranny and evil, a lone Strider named Hiryu must use his sharply honed skills to fight for justice and peace, and defeat the Grandmaster, an evil dictator who has taken over the world. 

The game features a number of improvements over the original. The graphics have been improved by making use of 2D animations placed on 3D backgrounds.

Strider now has a range of new moves including a double jump, backward somersault and dash, which allows him to perform longer jumps. He also has the ability to boost his weapon, the Cypher sword, enabling it to release homing plasma waves. There is also a Savage Slash attack, with random slashes.

There are numerous bonuses that can be collected in the levels. These either boost Striders vitality, increase the power of his sword or increase your game score.

A welcome addition to the game is a Boss Gauge which lets you know how much energy the mid- or end of level boss has left before it dies.</desc>

		<path>./Suikoden (USA).chd</path>
		<name>Suikoden</name>
		<desc>Loosely based on the classic medieval Chinese novel "Water Margins" (Shuihuzhuan) by Shi Nai'an. The game is a fantasy RPG set in an imaginary universe, its main theme being political struggle. The hero of the game is the young son of Theo McDohl, a general who serves the Scarlet Moon Empire, presently controlling the land of Toran. Through a series of events the hero becomes involved in a rebellion against the Empire, led by an organization known as the Liberation Army. Will the hero find a new home there, will he be able to tear himself away from everything that has been sacred to him, including his own father?

Suikoden is a console-style RPG with several unusual additions. There are three kinds of combat in the game, the most common one being the traditional turn-based party combat (players can have up to six people in their active party). Magic runes can be equipped on the player's characters which allow limited usage of offensive and healing spells. There are also army battles, where the player must control whole units of fighters, archers, magicians, etc., and one-on-one fights.

The game allows the player to build and customize a castle, which serves as their home base and fortress.108 characters can be recruited in the game, a tribute to 108 Stars Of Destiny in "Water Margins". Many of those characters will be available as active party members and participate in battles, while others will act as strategy advisers, or enhance the castle itself in various ways.</desc>

As a member of the Alliance, a military force only really hinted at in the original, you play the unwitting hero of the game: an orphan who has been raised by a quiet, unassuming battle hero in a seemingly ancient war. Alongside you in the ranks is your best friend Jowy, a boy born of nobility but who has never been able to receive approval in his stubborn father's eyes. As the game begins, you are immediately tossed into a tale of political strife, betrayal and war on a grand scale beyond your scope in the early stages. As the game wears on, the plot will twist, turn and develop in numerous ways that expose the personalities of each of the characters involved. The battle system is turn-based, with the option to equip Runes for special abilities, combine party member attacks to create chain combos or devastating spells, and the option to run the battle in Auto mode.</desc>

		<desc>Lomax's friends are in trouble, and it's up to you to save them from the sinister villain, Evil Ed. Using a magical spell, the fiend has kidnapped them and is forcing them to do whatever he instructs. Adventures of Lomax is a platform game that presents itself as a Lemmings spin-off (after all, it is developed by the same company).

As the hero, you will have to jump and shoot your way through a multitude of side scrolling 2D levels while picking up different power-ups. The special items Lomax encounters gain him invincibility; increase the jumping range and power of his attacks. Most effects fade off in a specific amount of time and are there to give you a quick health boost.

Adventures of Lomax takes place across several stages (over 40 in all) that range from outdoor areas, caves, and dark and spooky castles (four different environments). Because this is a platformer, you'll run across obstacles from time to time, required to either blast things away, like bats and zombies, or jump from platform to platform.</desc>

Korben, played by Bruce Willis in the film, is a cab driver. He lives in New York City when the game starts, and he is the one man capable of saving the world.

Leeloo is The Fifth Element. She is the only hope that the universe has against Pure Evil.

The story goes that every five thousand years a door is opened between dimensions. One dimension is our universe, and the other is the anti-universe. This universe is known as Pure Evil, and waits for the doors to open, since every five thousand years the four basic elements (earth, air, fire, water) are gathered around the fifth the perfect being (Leeloo).

The two characters have different options available to them. Korben can use guns, while Leeloo can use grenades. This helps you in certain aspects of the game, and choosing your character wisely can mean the difference between life and death.</desc>

A year later a special edition of the game was released for the Sony PlayStation as a part of their Greatest Hits line-up and featured several modifications to the game play.

The player takes control of characters struggling to survive on populated by over 20 species of dinosaurs in an environment of escalating chaos. There are 5 characters in all to choose from, each with their own special abilities and attributes. While the game is in 3D, the game play resembles early 2D platformers in which you generically either go left or right, limiting the mobility of each character.</desc>

		<name>Tobal 2</name>
		<desc>Tobal 2 is a sequel to Tobal Nr. 1. Like its predecessor, it is a fighting game with an additional Quest Mode, which has been expanded and added new features in this sequel.

The basic fighting gameplay is the same as in the first game, utilizing free movement in a 3D environment (provided the player character is facing the opponent) with high, medium, and low punches and kicks, as well as the trademark grappling and throwing moves. An unblockable fireball attack has been added in this installment.

The Quest Mode has undergone a significant expansion, including role-playing elements. In addition to the dungeons featured in the first game, the sequel adds an explorable town, where the main character can eat, rest, and buy supplies. An experience system has also been added. Consuming food and potions will have an effect on the character's attack and defense power. Individual attacks and body parts can be increased in strength as well.

Also new in the Quest Mode is the ability to capture encountered monsters and then use them as playable characters in the Vs. mode. The amount of playable characters in this fighting game can be therefore as high as two hundred.</desc>

		<name>Tomb Raider</name>
		<desc>The central character in Tomb Raider is the English archaeologist Lara Croft, a female adventurer in search of ancient relics. Lara was created by one-time Core designer Toby Gard,[1] and grew out of a number of ideas discarded in early concepts. She appears almost invariably with brown shorts, boots and small backpack, a dark green or blue sleeveless top, holsters on both sides of her hip for dual wielded pistols.
 Tomb Raider is an action-adventure video game developed by Core Design and published by Eidos Interactive. It was originally released in 1996 for the Sega Saturn, with MS-DOS and PlayStation versions following shortly thereafter. Tomb Raider was also released into the mobile gaming market, for Windows Mobile Professional in 2002, the Nokia N-Gage in 2003. The game was released for the PlayStation Network in the U.S. in August 2009, and in Europe in August 2010. Tomb Raider follows the exploits of Lara Croft, an English female archaeologist in search of ancient treasures.
 STORY:
 The story opens with a prologue in Los Alamos County, New Mexico. A great explosion causes an earthquake and exposes an ancient device buried beneath the desert surface. The device unlocks and reveals a person in suspended animation. The story then continues in the present day.
 In Tomb Raider, Lara Croft hunts for pieces of a talisman called the Scion, the first of which is found in the Tomb of Qualopec in Peru.
 At a hotel in present day Calcutta, Lara Croft is contacted by an American named Larson, who works for the wealthy businesswoman Jacqueline Natla, owner of Natla Technologies. At Natla's request, Lara sets out on an expedition to recover a mysterious artefact called the Scion from the lost tomb of Qualopec, in the mountains of Peru. 
 GAMEPLAY:
 In Tomb Raider, you assume the role of a beautiful archaeologist, Lara Croft. She is a thrill seeker and is willing to do almost anything that puts her life in danger -- she enjoys it. Naturally, Lara jumped all over the opportunity to recover the powerful Scion, an ancient relic scattered throughout the caverns and temples of the world.
 Played from a 3rd person 3D perspective, her adventure spans over 15 levels set in 4 distinct worlds and environments. As Lara, you'll have to solve ancient riddles in the Egyptian Pyramids, discover the Lost City of Atlantis and traverse through Ancient Rome all while looking for the artifact. Each level is laced with traps and hazards that require you to flip, swim and climb your way to safety and success.
 Along the way, you'll engage in battle with countless enemies including wolves, bears and the occasional "extinct" dinosaur. Fortunately, you have a slew of weapons at your disposal. Lara's default weapon is dual pistols and as you progress further into the game, you'll come across shotguns, magnums and an Uzi. When the ammunition is running low, you'll have to make good use of her various maneuvers to avoid enemy contact.</desc>

Five thousand years later, Lara Croft discovers the lost tomb and unwittingly unleashes the evil God Set, fulfilling the ancient prophecy of his return to plunge mankind into darkness! In a race against time, Lara must use all her wit and skill to reimprison Set and save the world from Armageddon. Pursued at every turn by her arch-rival, the unscrupulous archaeologist Werner Von Croy, Lara embarks on a journey of discovery across Egypt, where she must overcome the most ingenious puzzles and infernal traps ever devised, and face terrifying evil from beyond the grave...

With more twists and turns than an Egyptian labyrinth, this is heart stopping action-adventure; a Tomb Raider that truly offers...

		<desc>A few days after the events described in Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation, Lara Croft is presumed dead. Her close friends begin to recollect her previous adventures, which occurred during different periods of her life. These include searching for the Philosopher's Stone in Rome; preventing the Spear of Destiny from falling into the hands of a ruthless gang leader; facing monsters on the Black Isle of Ireland as a child; and, finally, infiltrating a high-tech complex in pursuit of the Iris artefact.

Like its predecessors, Tomb Raider: Chronicles is an action game with puzzle-solving and platforming elements. The gameplay is very similar to that of the previous games, with the addition of a few new skills. Lara can now walk on tightropes, swing on horizontal bars, and somersault forwards from a ledge while crouching. A grappling hook has been added to her inventory. The game also includes a level editor, allowing the player to create new stages for Lara to explore.</desc>

		<name>Tomb Raider III : Adventures of Lara Croft</name>
		<desc>The amazing adventurer Lara Croft returns once again with the third release in the Tomb Raider series for the PlayStation, Tomb Raider III: The Adventures of Lara Croft. This time she has some new moves such as crawl, monkey swing, and speed dash to help her through tough situations.
			The story unfolds with some background on the current situation. In years past, British sailors discovered a meteor buried deep in the Earth. Unwittingly, they looted four artifacts found with the meteor. One of these sailors kept a journal as they headed back to England -- he was the only one to make it home alive.
			With that in mind, the game begins with several key elements falling into place that will eventually reunite the lost artifacts. Lara is in India searching for one of these precious items, unaware of its true history. She only knows that local beliefs state that the artifact was to contain great powers.
			It is up to you as Lara to use what little information you have at hand to begin your quest in finding the artifacts, and discovering their power.
			Tomb Raider III's graphics have been updated from the previous titles with a faster engine. Such improvements include more texture palettes for finer detail, improved water and reflection effects, smoother surfaces and real-time lighting effects.
			The story and gameplay are designed to unfold in a non-linear fashion, as in Lara's previous adventures, but even more so. This time gamers will be able to choose their own destiny by selecting the order in which they play each of the four main levels. The levels are also more open, with multiple routes to the same end. You may also choose to replay each level so you can avoid missing any part of the adventure.</desc>

		<desc>The fourth game in Activision and Neversoft's seminal skateboarding series is designed to bring additions and refinements to the already polished gameplay that's made Tony Hawk's Pro Skater one of the most important video game franchises of its time. Many of these improvements are in line with advances made in earlier THPS sequels, while others may come as a surprise to longtime fans of the series.

Environments are designed to seem even larger and more interactive in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4, with less worry over time limits and more emphasis on exploration. The game also adds new tricks to the pro skaters' repertoires, allowing huge, point-packed combos. The "spine transfer" challenges skaters to zip up one side of a double ramp and down the other. Players will trick off of moving cars and other interactive elements of the game's diverse levels with new finesse.</desc>

		<desc>Valendra is a land that had undergone civil war. The end of which had birthed the parliament and several organizations to control the balance of power. Ashley Riot is a Riskbreaker agent, an elite one man investigator, for the Valendia Knights of Peace (VKP) who is investigating some strange occurrences. A cult of religious fanatics known as Müllenkamp, and their leader Sydney Losstarot, have seized the manor of Duke Bardorba of Valendia Kingdom. The events at the manor have sent Ashley on a quest to get to the bottom of what's going on, and travel into the catacombs that lead to the destroyed, yet magical city of Leá Monde. However Ashley is not the only person interested in the city, and other factions of the government, including parliament assigned Knights of the Crimson Blade and other VKP agents are pursuing their own agenda. 

Combat is central to the game. The game runs in real time but when entering combat and attacking an enemy, the game is paused. A wireframe sphere showing the range of the currently selected weapon and detailed statistics on different body parts of the enemies within range.

The game features a range of weapons. Each weapon can be disassembled and reassembled in workshops scattered throughout the game, attaching gems for extra power. Weapons used constantly against the same type of enemy improve in power against them.

Ashley can also make use of Magic, Chain Abilities and Break Arts. Magic is broken into four groups, namely defense, combat, healing and status. Spells use up mana points and are sometimes more costly than useful. Chain Abilities allow Ashley to "chain together" consecutive hits against enemies. Break Arts are special skills learnt after repetitive use of a weapon type. Sacrificing some of the player's health, Break Arts can perform a high damage attack on an enemy.</desc>

The player can choose to play through a story mode, Quest Mode, or play with an assorted number of bots in Arcade mode. The game also offers a new two-player cooperative mode and a Grand Melee Deathmatch mode, wherein the player endures attacks by multiple AI opponents. Second Offense introduced the "Salvage Points" system, which allows the player to upgrade their vehicle by collecting Salvage Points from destroyed opponents, improving the vehicle's offense, defense, speed, and targeting abilities. The vehicle's external appearance also improves with more Salvage Points and turns into a totally different design when it is fully upgraded. Special icons scattered over the game zone allows the player to improve mobility over certain environments, such as hover pods, skis, and outboard motors. The original game's five standard weapons - mines, rockets, autocannons, homing missiles, and mortars - are now supplanted by flamethrowers, with each weapon now capable of performing three special attacks using movements on the control pad. The Totaling and Whammy combat modes from the first game are also retained, as is the concept of stages with interactive features.</desc>

		<desc>Warcraft II: The Dark Saga brings the successful Warcraft series to the console world, delivering medieval orc vs. human combat to those that haven't been able to enjoy the PC version. Warcraft II is a real-time strategy game that requires players to build up orc and human forces by building structures and creating units for combat. The main objective is to take control of one race and wipe the other one completely off of the map.
 The console version of Warcraft II sports some changes from its PC predecessor. First and foremost, both the original version of Warcraft II as well as the expansion pack are included. This means twice as many maps and four separate campaigns, giving players 52 different missions split between the races. Other additions include six new full-motion video cut-scenes, and the ability to group sixteen units instead of nine. Also included are extra production options, meaning that if you control multiple bases, it will be easier to maintain one while focusing your attention on the other.
 While Warcraft II: The Dark Saga only features single-player missions, players can create their own maps, as well as use custom mission maps that the game includes to make their own scenarios.</desc>

		<desc>X-COM: UFO Defense is based on the 1994 PC game originally developed by Mythos Games Ltd. The player assumes control of the X-COM task force, building bases and tracking various UFOs on a 3D map of Earth. Once a UFO is spotted (represented by a red cross), you must try to intercept it so that it crashes over dry land. You'll then need to send your heavily armed squad to the site, where you'll witness the downed craft and surrounding terrain from an isometric perspective.

Moving your troops is accomplished through a point-and-click interface with each side alternating turns. Your three goals are to (1) engage the aliens face to face, (2) either stun or kill them, and (3) retrieve whatever technology or weapons you find so your scientists can replicate them. After all, you have to fight fire with fire! The PlayStation version supports both the mouse and memory card, with the latter allowing you to save the game at any point (as long as you have five blocks free).</desc>

To do so, the player has a choice between three types of space ship, each of them differs in terms of firepower and speed. The game has two different difficulty modes and a password system to resume the fight for the first five levels. During gameplay, the player has the possibility to pick up a wide variety of power-ups for their ship. Next to the main gun, side weapons and anti-gravity orbs with their own firepower can be obtained as well as mega-bombs, among other things.

The game is over once all lives or continues are used up. The player is then taken to a high-score screen to enter their initials.</desc>

		<desc>Circuit Breakers is a racing game similar to Micro Machines and Ignition, where the vehicles resemble toys viewed from above. The game lets the player control cars (of various models), boats and submarines that change according to the track.  The tracks have power-ups. They can be collected and activated and have negative and positive effects. Most are standard power-ups from this type of game, like speed boosts and oil leaks. Some are more bizarre, making the vehicle bigger or smaller, or making it bounce or fly.  The tracks are organized by theme and difficulty. By winning races the player receives access to increasingly more challenging tracks. The game controls are particularly sensitive, and getting out of the path often makes the vehicle explode.  Instead of a fixed camera, the game usually changes angles when the vehicle reaches certain points of the track. The camera can go as low as behind the vehicle, and go high to a "bird's eye" viewpoint.  Multi-player mode has its own set of tracks. It supports up to 4 players (using a multi-tap).</desc>

In the story mode, Heero can pilot any of the available mobile suits to do battle with his enemies. Each suit has its own set of special moves and a super attack. Some of the weapon based special attacks use ammunition which can eventually run out. The super attack can only be used 3 times during each fight. Each suit also has thrusters that can be used to fly in the air a bit. On the defensive side, players can dodge attacks by sidestepping and also can utilize a beam shield which can be used to protect the player from projectile attacks. Mobile suits come with 3 life bars total and fights are decided by trying to deplete all the life bars of an enemy mobile suit.  The game also contains a 2 player versus mode.   Options allow the player to choose their difficulty level and also let them set the timer during a match to either on or off.</desc>

But don't think your opponents will treat you with the giving of flowers either, because they will aiming to send you and your vehicle back to smash repairers not in one piece, but for the sale of spare parts.   From the main menu, players can select from Single Race, Demolition League and Two Player modes. Single Race is further broken down into Demolition (the importance is both based on getting over the finishing line and scoring demolition points), The Chase (crossing the finishing line is the only goal), Chicken (drive aggressively, but try to stay alive to cross the finish line, and oh yeah there are cars driving in the opposite direction too you), Last Man Standing (a bowl competition, last man not smashed up wins) and Suicide (opposite to Last Man Standing, it's a battle to destroy yourself first) all with the unifying idea of being based on a single race.   Demolition League is a competition mode spread over various tracks with the very broadly split Arena and Circuit competitions. Circuit difficulties include Rookie League (5th or better to pass), Semi-Pro League (six demolition styled courses, but you have to place at least third in every race), Pro League (eight courses, but you must place first in all) and Endurance League. Two Player mode on the other hand not only allows players to play in the standard Single Race competitions (such as Chicken, Last Man Standing, Chase and Suicide), but also the Two Player only Team Demolition (a co-operative demolition mode) and Head 2 Head Demolition.</desc>

		<desc>This game features digital photography instead of the hand-drawn anime-style art from the other titles. It was released for the Sega Saturn a year later and the PlayStation Network in Japan in 2009. The subtitle of this game loosely translates to "The Ultimate, Most Strongest Man in the Milky Way" or "The Ultimate, Invincible, Most Galactically Powerful Man". The game is based on the engine of the first Cho Aniki. As such, Idaten and Benten are again the main two characters. The game is often derided as having the worst play mechanics in the series. Even some of the most fervent fans of Cho Aniki claim that the campy fun is inhibited by poor control and impossible difficulty. Koji Hayama returned to score a few songs for the soundtrack, along with Don McCow, Taku Iwasaki and Sanae Kasahara.
Newly formed publisher MonkeyPaw Games released this game on September 21, 2010 in North America and on October 5, 2011 in Europe on the PlayStation Network.</desc>

		<desc>In the game, three karateka fight against each other on a beach, trying to be the first to score six points. After every two rounds, there is a bonus game which is either deflecting bouncing balls or kicking away bombs. The C64 version of the game only has the ball bouncing bonus game, and not the bomb bonus game. The game can be played by one or two human players, at least one fighter is always controlled by the computer. Unlike its predecessor, International Karate, there is only one backdrop. However, different parts of the backdrop can be recoloured to several different themes by the players using specific keystrokes. The Amiga and Atari versions of the game (and possibly other versions, unconfirmed) had a number of "background antics", a Pac-Man would appear, a spider would descend, and a U-boat's periscope would occasionally be seen in the harbour. In addition, pressing the "T" key would cause the trousers of all three protagonists to fall down, after which they would do a double-take. Additionally, it was possible (on the Amiga version, at least) to type in four-letter curse words; the game would respond first by rebuking the player for their use of such language, and upon the second offence would reset the game.</desc>

		<desc>Monster Trucks offers nine rugged off-roaders with which to race across jagged, imposing terrains. Not the only game to twist the racing genre to this end, but as you'd expect from Psygnosis, the quality of presentation is head and shoulders above the rest.

There are two types of courses; circuits offer demanding hilly terrains which can easily trash the vehicle and must be learned intimately. Endurance courses offer greater freedom, with the aim of finding the best route to link eight dispersed checkpoints.

To avoid any disorientation, arrows guide you to the next marker. Each area, be it snowy or volcanic, has characteristic features and hazards, yet this doesn't stop a repetitive feel developing. The third option is a fun mode, and one you might expect from the developer of Destruction Derby. Players have sixty seconds to take their truck on a car smashing spree.</desc>

Once the meter is full, the player will literally catch fire and their stats will max out for a brief period of time, allowing the player to score goals better, steal the puck more often, etc.

There is five difficulty settings and adjustable options such as period time times and cheat options such as "Big Head" mode and multiplayer capabilities for either head-to-head action or co-op play.

		<desc>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 features the series' trademark open-ended gameplay, in which the player (playing as a professional skateboarder) completes a number of tasks which result in cash rewards. With money gained, the player can then purchase skill improvements and better skateboards. THPS2 was also the first game in the series to introduce the manual, a skateboarding trick where the performer balances on two wheels. This enables players to string together trick combos. The game also introduced the Noseslide, Tailslide, Bluntslide, Nosebluntside, Feeble, and Overcrook grinds. It was also the first of the Pro Skater games to feature Create-a-Skater and Park Editor features, now staples in the series.</desc>

While all of the standard gameplay modes like Exhibition, Season, and Playoffs are included, two modes have been added: Slam Dunk Challenge and Three-Point Shootout. In the Slam Dunk Challenge, you choose the difficulty of your dunk and must memorize a series of button presses. The score for the dunk is determined by how well you recreate the button sequence. The Three-Point Shootout calls for you to stop a power bar in one of three locations to get the ball to go through the hoop. You have 60 seconds to shoot 25 balls, so you've got to be efficient if you want to win. No matter how you like your hoops action, you're sure to find what you want with NBA IN THE ZONE '99.</desc>

The missions that are similar (usually those taken from the film) further tend to play out differently, and utilize completely different gadgets and weaponry.</desc>

		<name>Chrono Cross</name>
		<desc>Chrono Cross is a sequel to the SNES RPG  Chrono Trigger.

The main character is Serge, a young boy from a fishing village. One day, while strolling on the sea shore with his sweetheart, Serge suddenly disappears. He comes back to senses several moments later. Everything seems just the same as it was before, but when Serge visits his home village, nobody recognizes him. He hears from people that he has been dead for ten years. Serge begins to realize that he is now in a parallel world. His first and only wish is to find a way to return home, but, in order to do that, he must understand what has caused the existence of parallel words, allowing inter-dimensional travel. His quest will also reveal to him the truth about his own existence, and connect the seemingly unrelated plot of Chrono Cross to that of Chrono Trigger.

Chrono Cross is a Japanese RPG with turn-based battles. There are no random battles; enemies are always visible on screen. There are also no character levels in the game; instead, characters get better stats directly after each battle. During battles, Serge and his party members can perform three kinds of attacks: weak, medium, and strong. Strong attacks tend to miss more frequently. Magical spells are equipped by each character like items, and can be cast only as many times as they are equipped. Actions in battle deplete a certain amount of stamina, which recovers as other characters act. 

Chrono Cross features many recruitable characters (up to 40, but not all of them can be recruited in one play-through), several different endings, and the ability to play the game again with the same stats and items from the previous play.</desc>

		<name>Colony Wars</name>
		<desc>Since 3095, the Earth Empire has spread throughout the universe, taking what it wants and destroying the rest - all in the name of sustaining life on Earth.  To the Empire, expansion is of the utmost importance, even above famine, drought and death.

The League of Free Worlds exists to offer resistance and hope to the plundered outlying colonies.  After a key victory, it is shown that the Empire's Navy can be harmed and the ranks of the League begin to swell.

Colony Wars is a combat fighter game set in space.  You, as the player, join as a recruit in the League's fleet.  Missions take place in various fighters, from a 1st person view inside the cockpit, or a 3rd person view from behind your ship. Ships have separate meters for shields and armor, and the player must cycle between weapons designed specifically to damage each. At the most basic, purple lasers must drain a target's shields, followed by switching to red lasers to destroy them.

The game features advanced lighting and particle effects for the Playstation, as well as a basic simulation of Newtonian physics. Thrusters are only active for as long as the accelerate button is held down. The player can burst fire their thrusters and drift, allowing for some advanced maneuvers. The campaign also features multiple endings and branching missions/storylines, based on your performance in the previous operations.</desc>

There is a full sequence of missions to complete, as well as some pre-set challenges and a Free Driving mode allowing you to explore at your leisure.</desc>

Somewhere in the futuristic Hong-Kong, full of huge corporations, flying cars and helicopters, home for the famous Triad mafia, they have to find the young Wee Ming Lam, the daughter of a powerful gangster. But Hana and her partners don't suspect that the search for Wee Ming will lead them not only to very dangerous areas of Hong-Kong, but to outskirt villages infected by zombies, a dubious restaurant-brothel, and the Chinese hell, where they'll have to confront Yim Lau Wong himself - the Chinese equivalent of the Western Satan...

The gameplay of "Fear Effect" is based on survival horror titles à la  Resident Evil, but it also features many pure action elements and arcade-like sequences, where precise timing matters. You can crouch, sneak on your enemies, and roll forward or to the sides. There are many human as well as monster enemies to eliminate or to avoid. The game's characters are created in animé style, although they appear in full 3D. The backgrounds are pre-rendered, but very intensely animated, similar to those of  Blade Runner. The story unfolds through numerous FMV cut scenes.</desc>

		<desc>In Cold Blood requires players to use more brains than brawn in solving a case of international intrigue, puzzle-solving, clue gathering, and the unwinding of a tangled web of espionage, double-crosses and a sinister plot that might threaten the free world. The story unwinds in an unusual manner: At the start of the game, your character, Agent John Cord, has been captured by the enemy and is in the midst of a grueling interrogation. The scenes from the game come from his memories as he is undergoing this ordeal, with players taking on his previous adventures that lead him up to this point. It is a spy-thriller in the vein of James Bond, and as Cord remembers more, the overall story begins to make more sense.

Throughout In Cold Blood, players will have to search for hidden objects and talk to a whole host of characters, attempting at every turn to solve the puzzles that pop up in their way. But tricky conundrums aren't the only thing blocking their paths -- they'll also have to take control of Agent Cord in high-octane gun battles against enemy agents. Occasionally, the player can outwit the enemies, but they'll often they'll have to fight it out in a duel to the death.</desc>

The combat takes place in a series 3D grid based maps and each character in the party has a certain amount of movements they can perform each turn. As the game progresses, other characters join and leave the party and as they increase in level they can progress along different paths of development. Between each battle there is a cut scene that develops the plot using the same 3D engine as the combat (and often the same areas).

In between battles you have the opportunity to talk to people in cities as well as purchase different equipment for the up coming battles.</desc>

		<name>Koudelka</name>
		<desc>The premise behind Koudelka takes place in Aberyswyth, Wales at a monastery known as Nementon Abbey. Found in a remote location, the abbey was built as a place of worship, learning and teaching; it was a place where scholars found peace.
 As time went by, Nementon Abbey was turned into a prison and it's inhabitants were confined to suffer and die. This practice continued for many years until the facility was purchased by Patrick Heyworth, a wealthy criminal who turned the once peaceful monastery into a refuge for vagrants and law-breakers. After Heyworth took control over the building, rumors of horror and great riches echoed throughout the world; the rumors lured many thieves, none of which returned to their homes.
 Forward to Halloween 1898 -- present day. Three adventures have entered the complex, each with their own significant purpose for scouring the halls of Nementon Abbey. Players assume the role of Koudelka Iasant, a young gypsy plagued with psychic powers that caused her to be ousted from her family; she's entered the abbey in search of answers as to who she really is. The fearless Edward Plunkett has come for excitement and a share of the rumored wealth. Finally, James O'Flaherty is a bishop sent by the Vatican on an unspecified mission.</desc>

The twist lies in the fact that the enemies are, in truth, the player's very own comrades, posing as enemies and sacrificing their lives for the sake of allowing only the most skilled pilots to pass the test, and survive.  The player flies their selected fighter over 5 areas of various terrain, encountering a number of land, sea and air enemies.

The main character is voiced by Bruce Campbell, star of the Evil Dead movies.  Throughout the game, he makes wisecracks and one-liners, and dialogue with personnel is generally comical.  Broken Helix is considered a 4D game.  For example, if you are on the third floor, you may have to make your way up to the fifth floor in order to defuse a bomb.  There is no visible time limit, but if you do not make it up to that floor in time, the bomb will go off, and you will die.  There are various objectives to complete, such as disarming bombs and finding certain items, but the game is mostly action/adventure, searching for keys to open doors.  In order to be successful, you must sneak past cameras and other devices, in order to find out the truth behind the terrorist takeover.</desc>

		<desc>The story begins in 1997. It's the dead of night in the city of Los Angeles, and there has been a mass murder at a general hospital on the outskirts of downtown. The perpetrator is the director of the hospital, Richter Harris. He has shut himself up in the hospital and taken a number of patients as hostages, leaving the police helpless and unable to move in. Richter's only daughter, Laura Harris, after hearing the situation, rushes to Los Angeles from San Francisco, and drives alone to the tragic scene at the hospital ground. Upon entering the hospital Laura finds herself transported to an old mansion, while the disembodied voice of her father pleads with her to leave. Nevertheless she must press forward to save her father and herself.  D is a puzzle game requiring Laura to solve esoteric inventory puzzles on a very strict time limit. Each of the game's four discs must be completed in about thirty minutes each, and saving is not an option. The time is kept track of using Laura's pocket watch. The pocket watch can also be used to supply hints for puzzles, but after three uses the glass will shatter and it will stop working. The game also has multiple endings.</desc>

		<name>Dark Messiah</name>
		<desc>The future Tokyo is a megapolis built on top of a huge system of underground tunnels and sewers. A rumor is heard that in this underground world hide the followers of a mysterious cult, known as the Dark Messiah. At the same time a symbiotic life form escapes from scientists and makes it's way into the sewer system. There it causes the crash of a subway train and starts devouring the passengers on board. A lone hero, along with a schoolgirl Naomi Sugiura are the only survivors of the crash.... and must flee from the creature in order to survive.  Hellnight is a survival horror game at heart, although it has no combat gameplay. Controlling the nameless hero, the player must travel through the underground and protect Naomi. There is only one monster in the whole game, the "creature" itself, which is invulnerable and cannot be killed. Instead players are constantly on the run from it, making sure it does not catch them. The game is divided into large maze-like levels, each one usually populated by the creature who keeps pursuing the player (although he does change form after each level). At certain points there will be companions who can attack the monster and temporarily stun him. There are also people to talk to in the underground world, items to pick up, and puzzles to solve.</desc>

		<desc>Welcome to Demolition Racer, a racing game where pitstops, yellow flags and mercy for your opponents will never exist. But don't think your opponents will treat you with the giving of flowers either, because they will aiming to send you and your vehicle back to smash repairers not in one piece, but for the sale of spare parts.   From the main menu, players can select from Single Race, Demolition League and Two Player modes. Single Race is further broken down into Demolition (the importance is both based on getting over the finishing line and scoring demolition points), The Chase (crossing the finishing line is the only goal), Chicken (drive aggressively, but try to stay alive to cross the finish line, and oh yeah there are cars driving in the opposite direction too you), Last Man Standing (a bowl competition, last man not smashed up wins) and Suicide (opposite to Last Man Standing, it's a battle to destroy yourself first) all with the unifying idea of being based on a single race.   Demolition League is a competition mode spread over various tracks with the very broadly split Arena and Circuit competitions. Circuit difficulties include Rookie League (5th or better to pass), Semi-Pro League (six demolition styled courses, but you have to place at least third in every race), Pro League (eight courses, but you must place first in all) and Endurance League. Two Player mode on the other hand not only allows players to play in the standard Single Race competitions (such as Chicken, Last Man Standing, Chase and Suicide), but also the Two Player only Team Demolition (a co-operative demolition mode) and Head 2 Head Demolition.</desc>

There is nothing else on the planet beside this island and the vast ocean surrounding it. One day, you and two friends make a discovery and realize the the world was once much more than Estard Island. So what caused it to disappear? In order to find that out, you travel to the past, where you hope to solve the mystery and to restore the present world the way it was before.

This is their first crack at the whip with a PlayStation fighting game.   The game is weapons based, meaning there is no hand-to-hand combat that does not incorporate weapons. The storyline is in line with the Koei war sims, so this is a fighting game based on real history. The characters are pulled straight from the historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Each character is either based on or tied to one of the legendary warlords who fought to unite under their own kingdom.</desc>

		<desc>ESPN Extreme Games lets the player access three modes of play: Exhibition, New Season or a continuation of a season. Exhibition mode helps the player get to know the courses and equipment as well as get a feel for the controls. New season offers the player the chance to race against sixteen other competitors on any of the four racing machines competing for season points as well as money to upgrade equipment.   Choose between roller blades, a luge (basically a sit-down skateboard), a mountain bike, and the skateboard. The player can also determine which character they want to race with, each one having a unique skill on one of the apparatus. For example one might be top-notch at roller blading but be bad at bike-riding so there is no point choosing the bike with him/her. In a season, the player competes in the five locations - three times, twelve in all and each time the obstacles become more and more tricky to avoid as well as the other racers becoming faster and more agile.  </desc>

		<desc>Corruption -- the root of all evil. Alexandria's Queen Brahne was once presented as a noble and caring ruler, who would throw lavish festivals to show appreciation for her supporters. Recently, she became involved in secretive deals with mysterious people. Matters took a turn for the worse when a renegade troupe kidnapped her daughter and changed the fate of a once peaceful world.
 As young Zidane Tribal and his party interrupted a renowned play and kidnapped Princess Garnet Til Alexandros, things began to fall apart. The queen fired cannons and decimated her kingdom in an attempt to prevent the terrorist organization, but her attacks failed and the troupe escaped with their lives intact.
 Princess Garnet wished someone would take her away from her oppressing mother and life; the only world she knew was that of Alexandria and its large metropolitan areas. Zidane Tribal and his troupe had come at the perfect time. An innocent black mage known as Vivi Orunitia and a Pluto Knight named Adelbert Steiner, who was sworn to protect the princess at all costs, were also part of the crusade.
 Although Adelbert Steiner had objections, the characters formed a pact to overthrow Queen Brahne and prevent her harmful attack in the surrounding areas of Alexandria. After the princess was abducted, Brahne hired assailants to create destructive black mage warriors. With a few of her knights and the mages, the queen unleashed a series of unmitigated attacks on neighboring towns -- she would do anything to recapture Princess Garnet.
 But what are the queen's true intentions?</desc>

		<desc>Front Mission 3 is the third main entry and the fifth entry overall in the Front Mission series. Like other Front Mission titles, Front Mission 3 is part of a serialized storyline that follows the stories of various characters and their struggles involving mecha known as wanzers.  While it is a tactical role-playing game, there is a stronger emphasis on role-playing elements as opposed to strategic elements in Front Mission 3. The game progresses in a linear manner: watch cut-scene events, complete missions, set up wanzers during intermissions, and sortie for the next mission. The player travels to locations on a world map. As the player progresses through the plot, new locations are revealed on the world map. Towns and cities act as intermission points where the player can organize and set up their units for the upcoming mission. New to Front Mission 3 is the Double Feature Scenario - this allows the player to experience two different scenarios that exist independently of one another within the game's storyline. In other words, the player can play through two stories; while they may share common events and environments, the stories are largely unique and in essence are fully-fledged games.</desc>

The action moves through six levels spread over three different cities, each based on a real US city: Liberty City (based on New York City), San Andreas (based on San Francisco) and Vice City (based on Miami). To finish a level, a certain score must be reached. Stealing cars and crashing into traffic, driving over pedestrians and killing cops all raise the score, but the big points are made through jobs. Answering phones or entering special cars brings mission assignments, from simple "ditch-a-hot-car" jobs to supporting bank robberies or carrying out assassinations. Completing a mission will raise the score substantially and also increase the score multiplier, so that completing the next felony will gain even more points.</desc>

		<name>Grand Theft Auto - London 1969</name>
		<desc>Grand Theft Auto: Mission Pack #1 - London 1969 is an official expansion pack to Grand Theft Auto. Instead of the fictional interpretations of New York, Miami and Los Angeles of the original, this game opens up the city of London to the player. The game features thirty new vehicles, new graphics and thirty-two new missions; all in a distinctly British theme. The new city contains many familiar landmarks from London in the late 60s as well as other cultural reference and Cockney slang. This time the player can choose the avatar's appearance, otherwise gameplay has not been changed from the original game. The player still is involved in organized crime and must perform a variety of criminal activities.</desc>

		<name>Grand Theft Auto 2</name>
		<desc>The game takes place at an undisclosed time in the near future. Unlike the first game which featured three different cities, Grand Theft Auto 2 only features a single town, but it's divided in three districts which are unlocked one at a time: downtown, residential and industrial. Like in the original the player goes around answering phones to initiate various missions. The game uses an overhead camera in a 3D landscape and allows the player to freely explore the city and steal any vehicle the player sets his or her eyes on. To unlock new districts the player must reach a certain score which is done by committing crimes and finishing missions.

Because the game now features multiple criminal gangs, the player must choose allegiances. Performing missions for one gang, will decrease the player's reputation for another. When the player commits crimes he also becomes wanted by the local police, but as more crimes are committed without shaking the police, they will give way for first SWAT Teams, then Special Agents and finally the army.

New features include the ability to save at the church, when donating enough money, and various side missions, such as becoming a taxi driver to ear money. There are also many new cars with weapons attached such as a firetruck with a flamethrower and a car with machine guns.</desc>

		<path>./Grandia (USA).m3u</path>
		<name>Grandia</name>
		<desc>Grandia is a Japanese-style console RPG, with big-eyed anime style characters, that was first released on the Sega Saturn in 1997.  It centers around the story of a young hero named Justin who possesses a mysterious artifact known as the 'Spirit Stone'.  The story takes Justin and friends (who range from a bratty eight year-old to a noble knight and a thief with a short fuse) through distant towns and abandoned ruins of a forgotten civilization (and even the occasional military base) in a search for adventure and secrets long hidden from the world. Grandia makes use of FMV cut-scenes to advance the story.

The characters are represented by 2D sprites which are moved around over 3D backgrounds in towns and dungeons.  Combat is initiated by coming into contact with enemies on the screen, rather than through random battles.  Combat itself occurs in pseudo-real-time, using an 'IP Gauge' to determine when a character takes action. Striking at the right time or with the right ability can even delay or cancel an enemy's turn.

The characters in the game gradually advance in level as they gain experience points for killing monsters. Characters also gain experience based on the weapon (e.g. sword, mace, whip, etc.) or magic (e.g. fire, water, etc.) that they use, powering up their spells and learning new ones from continuous usage.  There are a large number of spells, weapons, and other items to use throughout the game.</desc>

		<name>Juggernaut</name>
		<desc>Juggernaut is a slow-paced, point-and-click adventure in the same vein as the PC title Myst. It tells the story of a young woman named Sarah who, after having received an antique bottle as a gift from her boyfriend, opens it only to be consumed by an enigmatic, evil force. Having inadvertently caused her plight, players assume the role of her boyfriend who, aided by a priest, must venture into her mind, defeat the being that now resides there, and ultimately, save her soul.   The gist of the gameplay consists of moving about a series of static screens, collecting items and objects for later use, and solving puzzles in order to progress further into the game. An onscreen compass allows players to determine in which cardinal direction they're able to proceed. Movement between these screens is facilitated by pressing the appropriate direction on the D-pad. If the scene contains any interactive elements, a cursor is displayed that can be moved about the environment, allowing players to investigate or manipulate whatever they are.   Exploring the recesses of Sarah's mind, players find themselves confronted with a variety of surreal, often disturbing images. The puzzles, too, are out of the ordinary, requiring players to find a corporeal entity for their spiritual essence so they may interact with objects; utilizing color and music to solve puzzles and the like. The title presents a host of puzzles that range in difficulty and scope, some requiring the use of acquired implements, while others demand logic.   The most important item in your possession is the pendant from your girlfriend.You can use this at any time to save your game.   Features:   * Save your girlfriend Sarah from the Great Evil that possesses her   * Acquire items that may be used to aid you in your quest   * Solve an array of puzzles to advance further into the title</desc>

		<desc>Enter a world where humans and creatures called Timenoids coexist. These blue-skinned Timenoids are determined to wipe out the inferior human race, and this is where you come in. You play the role of Millennia, a young woman who was brainwashed at an early age to do the Timenoids' bidding. She now believes that the humans must be exterminated from the world, which is rather ironic, since she is human herself. Yet if she succeeds, the Timenoids have promised her immortality and the power to become one of their own...   In this sequel to Tecmo's Deception, you are once again placed inside a castle to lure invaders into various traps. The game differs from the original in several ways, however. The view is no longer first-person, so you can see your character at all times. Multiple traps can also be triggered at once (up to three), forming even deadlier combinations than the original. In addition, the vibration mode is supported on the Dual Shock Analog Controller to provide feedback on each gruesome death. Prepare for a non-linear journey as the decisions you make during the game affect the type of ending you'll receive. Maybe, just maybe, you'll remember your past...</desc>

This allows the path followed to curve and for the player to interact with objects outside of the path. The game is divided into levels called "Visions", where the player progresses by following a path with defeatable computer-controlled enemies and puzzles that must be solved. At the end of some levels, the player must defeat a boss - a powerful enemy.

		<path>./Legend of Legaia (USA).chd</path>
		<name>Legend of Legaia</name>
		<desc>Legend of Legaia is a console RPG who's main innovation is its complex and unusual battle system.

Your initial party consists of three characters: Vahn, Noa, and Gala - two males and one female. You engage yourself on a quest of freeing your planet from a mysterious mist which is floating above the planet and which can turn anything it touches into a dreadful monster. In order to clean the planet from the horrible mist, you have to find so-called Genesis Trees which are scattered around on the planet. 

The combat system, which is probably the most original part of this game, isn't quite similar to the well-known menu-based Final Fantasy style. If you are familiar with the combat system of Xenogears, it's more similar to this one, but more complicated. Your choices aren't just attack, defend or use special abilities: the attack option itself has many choices: high-attack, low-attack, kick etc., a bit like in Revenant. Apart from this system, the game is a typical Asian console 3D RPG with manga characters, map-exploring, etc.</desc>

		<name>Looney Tunes Racing</name>
		<desc>Looney Tunes Racing is a kart-racing game for the PlayStation. There are some definite similarities between this title and Crash Team Racing, both in game play mechanics and depth. Completely immersed in the humor and soul of the Looney Tunes license, the player starts the game with only a handful of characters and levels available, but as the game proceeds features become unlocked including new characters, levels, and challenges.  Each character has an unique vehicle themed just for them, and is accompanied by voice taunts, provided by Warner Bros. licensed voice actors, and character-specific animations that help bring these characters to life.  The weapons the player can unleash onto the opponents include cherry bombs, homing cream pies, thunder clouds with devastating lightning bolts, and giant anvils that drop out of the sky. In addition, each uniquely themed level has a series of amusing booby traps and obstacles that the player can unleash to slow down your foes. The player can make boulders fall, launch giant boxing gloves on springs, and trample the opponents with sheep in the red-rock canyons, get spacecraft to fire lasers in the Martian level, and activate a huge, fat, white horse in the Opera stage to come in and trounce on the enemies. Even Gossamer, the large monster make entirely of red hair (except for those big white eyes and white tennis shoes), makes a cameo in the Gossamer’s castle level, as he comes right out onto the track to take out any oncoming traffic.  Beyond the races, other noteworthy game modes include the Multi-player Battle Mode, where the players basically pummel each other with wacky weaponry, and the ACME Challenges, which include challenges such as Boss Races (against Porky Pig, for example), picking up key items in a certain order, and others.</desc>

Using the Sega Saturn and PlayStation's advanced hardware, many elements of the original game's presentation have been altered, including a larger color palette, more sophisticated visual effects, and improved sound quality. Throughout gameplay, the story is interspersed with fully animated cut scenes designed to give the game a cinematic feel, and allow the player to get more involved in the game's plot. Players advance the game's narrative by completing story-based objectives and interacting with non-player characters. In the original version, players encountered enemy monsters randomly every few steps when traveling in a harsh environments, while the remake now makes enemies visible, with combat ensuing only after a character has come in contact with one.

Reading through its pages provides you with only a superbly crafted description of an island world. But it's just a book, isn't it? As you reach the end of the book, you lay your hand on a page. Suddenly your own world dissolves into blackness, replaced with the island world the pages described. Now you're here, wherever here is, with no option but to explore.  Myst is a first-person point-and-click adventure where the player controls a character known as The Stranger. Magically transported into the world described in the book, he needs to explore Myst Island and solve its mysteries. The game is presented as a series of static scenes where the player acts with the environment by clicking and manipulating objects. There are no enemies and it is not possible to die. Through Myst Island, the game is further divided into mini-worlds set in different ages accessed through different books.  The PSP version adds new adventure scenarios and includes widescreen support.

		<desc>NBA Hangtime is a basketball video game published &amp; developed by Midway and released for arcade in 1996. Home versions followed for Nintendo 64, PlayStation, Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, Super NES, and Windows. A version for Game.com was cancelled.

Hangtime was the third basketball game by the original development team behind the NBA Jam series. The title was changed due to the NBA Jam name being acquired by Acclaim Entertainment, the publisher of the games for the home market. Acclaim's NBA Jam Extreme was released the same year as Hangtime. Features introduced in Hangtime included character creation, alley oops and double dunks. A software update known as NBA Maximum Hangtime was released for the arcades later in the life cycle.

The ending of Maximum Hangtime promises a new, 3-D basketball title from Midway, which was eventually released as NBA Showtime: NBA on NBC.</desc>

		<name>Policenauts</name>
		<desc>In 2010, mankind has built its first space colony, Beyond Coast. After three years have passed, the founders of the colony feel it needs to be protected, and choose five best policemen of Earth to do that: Gatse Becker from Scotland Yard, the Japanese Sadaoki Tokugawa, Salvatore Toscanini from New York, and two policemen from Los Angeles: Jonathan Ingram, the hero of the game, and his best friend Ed Brown. 

One day, during a routine patrol on Beyond Coast, something happens to Jonathan's space suit. He is sucked into space and is presumed dead. But twenty-five years later, he is miraculously discovered in his life pod... alive. He still looks like a young man, but in reality he is 55 years old.

Trying to forget his past, Jonathan opens an investigation agency on Earth. His ex-wife (who has re-married during those twenty-five years) visits him and asks him to find her missing husband. When she leaves the office, her car explodes, and she dies. Determined to fulfill her final request, Jonathan prepares to re-visit Beyond Coast...

This unofficial semi-prequel to  Snatcher is a comic book/anime adventure with some shooting sequences. You click on objects and people you interact with, or move a dot around the screen to aim at your enemies during the shooting parts.</desc>

In spite of these little improvements, the game preserved (and improved a lot) many elements that did the previous one (Samurai Shodown III: Blades of Blood) a quite popular title, like the dodge move and the chance to choose between two versions of the fighter: the standard one and an alternative dark-styled one (SLASH and BUST, respectively).</desc>

It's a shooter, but you must also use strategy.  You have a health meter, so it's not a "one shot and you're dead" type of game. You must complete missions, or battle it out in a deathmatch with your friends, or enemies.

The plot is about you having to prevent the sale of the Syphon Filter virus to a terrorist nation.</desc>

		<path>./Legend of Dragoon, The (USA).m3u</path>
		<name>The Legend of Dragoon</name>
		<desc>Ten thousand years ago the Legend was born. The Divine Tree's mystical powers were said to have given birth to all life. The 105th race born of the Tree was the mighty Dragons. The 106th was the human race and the 107th was the Winglies. Peace and tranquility reigned throughout the land, but suddenly a violent uprising occurred, led by the Winglies, who enslaved humanity. To counter this, the humans acquired the Dragons' spiritual forces and defeated their nemeses, which led to eventual harmony between all. However, the prophecy has only begun as the past and future are about to collide...
 In Sony's role-playing game, The Legend of Dragoon for the PlayStation, you'll travel across the land searching for clues and discovering new enemies as well as friends you can add to your party. Up to three members per party can fight at once, in an interface that Final Fantasy fans may find familiar, the difference being that you can become a Dragoon with supernatural powers taken from the souls of Dragons. Animals will attack you from nowhere while other creatures and even human opponents will specifically seek and destroy.
 Each warrior has his or her own weapons and magic, with the ability to retreat a fight based on chance. Experience points will add up and each member of the party will gain a level as their hit points increase. The combat technique known as Dragoon Additions -- shown as SP (Spirit Power) -- measures a Dragoon's ability to fight. When your character approaches an enemy upon initiating an attack, a rectangular grid targets the enemy before your weapon is swung. If you press it in time for the outer rectangle to close in, matching the center rectangle, you'll be able to hit your target and continue to get in several more hits depending on how fast and accurate you are executing the button sequence.
 Magical attacks draw their power from the Elements such as water, fire, wind, earth, darkness and light, thunder, and non-elemental. Using the opposite of an enemy's element will inflict the most damage. The game also consists of another unique fighting technique that is more commonly used: the Multi-Attack. It allows one to inflict more damage than normal. When it is used, the X button appears onscreen and you must rapidly tap the X button to increase the power of the attack to over 100 percent. If you do nothing, you will only inflict a small amount of damage. There is also the interactive counterattack which, if not properly done, will cut off the rest of your combos and damage your fighter as a result.
 Arm yourself with a variety of weapons such as swords, spears, bows and arrows, axes and hammers. Protect yourself with body armor, helmets and boots. Other items like bracelets, amulets or stones carry with them magical powers to enhance attacks or deflect the damage of an attack. Although your journey begins with only basic weapons, others can be purchased from merchants or found in chests. Changing and upgrading weapons for the entire party can be done via the in-game menu, however some weapons are specialized for particular warriors. There are also items that can heal or wage war and they too are won in battle, found in chests, or purchased from merchants.
 Although you start out as Dart, a brave and loyal warrior swordsman sworn to avenge his parents' death by the Black Monster, other party members you'll run into have their own unique story to tell. Saving the game is done wherever you find Save Points; the only requirement is that you must have at least two blocks of memory available on a memory card. This one-player game is also analog and vibration compatible and comes on four CDs.</desc>

This involves a succession of action-packed non-linear missions. The environment incorporates shadows, rain, fog and a day/night cycle. Police cars, motorcycles and ambulances must be controlled during some missions. There are many ways to 'settle' the enemies - car chases, hand-to-hand combats and action movie-style shoot outs for example.</desc>

		<name>Valkyrie Profile</name>
		<desc>In preparation for Ragnarok, the final battle between the gods, Odin has commanded Lenneth the Valkyrie to descend to the lower world and gather the souls of fallen heroes to serve as soldiers in the approaching conflict. You play as Lenneth, gathering soldiers and training them to be transferred to the battlefields of the gods.

The gameplay mainly consists of exploring various locations (dungeons, mansions, swamps) from a 2D perspective. Lenneth can run, jump, shoot ice crystals (useful for anything from freezing enemies to building ledges), push and pull objects to solve simple puzzles, etc. All of the enemies are on-screen and can usually be avoided, in the style of games like Chrono Cross and SaGa Frontier 2. The battle system is a mix of real-time and turn-based elements. Each of the characters (up to three can fight alongside Lenneth at a time) is assigned to one of the four main keys. The player and the enemy take turns attacking, but with the right timing, the player can execute combos that leave enemies defenseless. Long combos can result in substantial experience bonuses, although it is possible to defeat most enemies without them.

The rest of the game consists of Lenneth using "spiritual concentration" to discover the locations of dungeons and fallen heroes, ingame-engine cutscenes that give the history of these characters, and reports about the war's progress that come at the end of each "chapter". The chapter system is one of the game's most original features. Each chapter (there are about 8) is made up of a preset number of periods. Each action, such as a successful use of spiritual concentration, or entering a town/dungeon, uses a number of periods that varies with the difficulty level. When all of the periods have passed, the chapter is over. Since the player must transfer heroes to Valhalla in the course of each chapter (permanently losing them), but has only a limited amount of time to improve their statistics, the game has a sense of urgency and danger often absent from more traditional console RPGs.</desc>

		<name>Vandal Hearts II</name>
		<desc>Vandal Hearts II is a turn based strategic RPG which is comparable to the more famous Fire Emblem series.    Most of the gameplay consists of moving your party on 3D grid based maps in a way that will give you a strategic advantage over your enemies. The main difference between Vandal Hearts II and its predecessor is the change of the battle system. Unlike in Vandal Hearts you and your enemies issue the commands at the same time and then move simultaneously. That results in in completely new strategies and gives the game a unique touch.    The story takes place in the already collapsed church state of Nirvadia, that was once formed by the religious leader St Nirvath, but eventually ceased to exist, because of several conflicts between unbelievers and local rulers. Caused by a chain of coincidences, the young boy Joshua, from a small and unimportant village in the east, eventually finds himself within a complex political scheme set in motion by power-hungry aristocrats and religious fanatics.</desc>

		<desc>Electronic Arts' motorcycle racing series makes its PlayStation debut with digitized graphics, a licensed soundtrack, and full-motion video cut-scenes. The fourth entry in the franchise continues the point-to-point racing format of the Genesis games, with players knocking out rivals with fists, boots, or even pilfered weapons. Two play options are available to rambunctious riders: Thrash Mode and Big Game Mode. The former lets players enter a single race on their choice of courses and difficulty levels, while the latter is structured like a career. Big Game Mode involves selecting one of eight colorful characters and competing in a total of 25 races on five Californian courses: Sierra Nevada, Napa Valley, Peninsula, The City, and Pacific Highway.</desc>

		<name>Dead or Alive</name>
		<desc>The first in the Dead or Alive series, and features many of the same features that has made the DoA series so popular today; somewhat realistic combat, good character design, and scantily clad women whose breasts bounce a lot.

The game doesn't mess too much with a background story- it's a 3D one on one fighter that takes place within an arena of limited space.  Each character has their own unique way of fighting, their own abilities, and even their own hobbies and likes.  (For example, Ryu Hayabusa- yes, he of Ninja Gaiden fame- likes sushi, mountain climbing, and fishing.)</desc>

		<desc>No refs... No rules... Just 'classic' gridiron. Late hits, pass interferences, and other penalties are encouraged (though you can't run offside). Cheerleaders in, well, cheerleading uniforms liven up the end of the first and third quarter and there's enough stats to make the mathematically inclined happy. However, the teams features are not entirely based on real life (Indy was at the top), and it is not as addictive as the old-fashioned PC games of the early 1990's, but still a good game for someone who doesn't mind not-so-classic, almost XFL style football.</desc>

After the initial entries of side-scrolling platform games, Duke Nukem 3D introduces a first-person perspective to the series and turns the game into a full-fledged shooter with 2.5D graphics.

Duke's arsenal includes pistols, pipe bombs, laser trip mines, Nordenfelt guns, a chain gun and various rocket launchers, but also his mighty foot to kick enemies. The game sports a high level of interactivity. Many objects in the environment can be broken or interacted with, such as pool tables, arcade machines, glass, light switches and security cameras. The protagonist is also able to hand strippers a dollars to have them remove their top.</desc>

He didn't count on a young man named Jason, a beautiful alien woman named Eve, and their battle tank, the Sofia MA-01...because of his underestimation, the Plutonium Boss was defeated.

Jason trained Elfie in engineering, and Roddy in battling in Sofia. But now Jason and Eve have died, and Roddy must take his father's place as defender of the Earth.

		<desc>Army Men: Air Attack 2, the sequel to the PlayStation's Army Men: Air Attack, has Captain Blade and his Alpha Wolf Squadron returning to action to continue the now infamous battles between the Green and Tan armies. The sequel features over twenty-five new missions with highly improved graphics, fully interactive environments, and gameplay reminiscent of Electronic Arts' Strike series.

Air Attack 2 has the same gameplay found in the first Air Attack game. You can move in all directions in this plastic 3D world using the left analog stick, strafe using the L1 and R1 buttons, and deploy various artillery, as well as use your chopper's winch, using the controller's face buttons. The different military hardware at your disposal depends on the helicopter and copilot you select between missions. These choices also have an impact on other aspects of the gameplay, such as weapons accuracy, winch speed, chopper speed, and the amount of abuse your craft can handle. These features offer nothing new in the way of gameplay, but their tight and responsive control more than make up for that.</desc>

Blasto is a third-person shooter with platforming elements. The protagonist can use various firearms to dispose of the alien enemies. Many fights are scripted, as aliens teleport around the hero when certain events are triggered. Different weapons must be used in different situations to gain the upper hand.</desc>

He divided the book and gave each clan a piece, hoping the clans would come to rely on each other's newly acquired knowledge. The Wanderer left and the clans, hoping to reassemble the book, returned to their old ways.   That is when Syn appeared. She turned the pieces of the book into weapons and organized a tournament of the clans' warriors. Whoever wins the tournament will control the Book of Knowledge and become the ruler of Bloodland.  Choose one of 20 characters, each with unique combos and weapons, and battle your way through the tournament. If the tournament is too much for you, practice your moves or fight in the Survival or Team Battle modes. Do you have what it takes to become the ruler of Bloodland?   A gory one-on-one fighting game, set within a series of semi-free-roaming enviroments.</desc>

		<name>Circuit Breakers</name>
		<desc>Circuit Breakers is a racing game similar to Micro Machines and Ignition, where the vehicles resemble toys viewed from above. The game lets the player control cars (of various models), boats and submarines that change according to the track.  The tracks have power-ups. They can be collected and activated and have negative and positive effects. Most are standard power-ups from this type of game, like speed boosts and oil leaks. Some are more bizarre, making the vehicle bigger or smaller, or making it bounce or fly.  The tracks are organized by theme and difficulty. By winning races the player receives access to increasingly more challenging tracks. The game controls are particularly sensitive, and getting out of the path often makes the vehicle explode.  Instead of a fixed camera, the game usually changes angles when the vehicle reaches certain points of the track. The camera can go as low as behind the vehicle, and go high to a "bird's eye" viewpoint.  Multi-player mode has its own set of tracks. It supports up to 4 players (using a multi-tap).</desc>

Only then will you have the power of the mighty Orb at your disposal to use as the ultimate weapon against Draak.    By the numbers, Darkstone contains four distinct regions of Uma, more than 100 evil creatures based on 30 types of characters, 32 specific spells and nearly two dozen skills (six major). Additional features include full 360-degree movement, more than 30 weapons (some multi-purposed), numerous items and traps and over 200 enemies and characters with which to interact.</desc>

		<desc>Jackie Chan's grandfather has been kidnapped and it is up to you to help save him! Midway's action-platform game, Jackie Chan Stuntmaster lets you experience some of what it takes to be the internationally known martial arts actor and stunt performer. You'll play as Jackie Chan himself from a third-person perspective as you cheat death through 15 levels set within a dangerous city full of thugs. Along the way, you'll also need to retrieve a stolen package from a gang of crooks.

The crime element is not the only thing you have to deal with -- you'll also cross narrow ledges, avoid obstacles and pitfalls, and even fight on top of a speeding subway train. To accomplish these feats, you must learn how to punch, kick, jump, grab and throw multiple opponents. You also need to climb ladders, open doors, pick up objects (using some as weapons), and hang on ledges or jump off walls. Sound familiar?

In addition to the ability to push around objects, you can flip tables and chairs, causing damage to nearby enemies. Other pick-ups let your character heal (rice, milk or take-out-boxes) while others are important for your quest (red and gold dragons and extra takes). Keep in mind that some are hidden beneath boxes, crates and potted-plants that you'll need to break.</desc>

		<name>Rally Cross</name>
		<desc>A chaotic, and bouncy rally racing game.  One of the aspects of this game that set it aside from other games at this time was the variety of the terrain.  Not only is it off-road, but the course is filled with jumps, dips, hairpins, and off camber turns.   Consequently, it is very common for the car to flip upside down.  By pressing the shoulder buttons, the player can rock the car left or right.  To get back on the tires, the user must time the rocking of the car to flip it back upright.    Any of the course can be raced forwards or backwards, and there is a season mode as well as the single race mode.  In order to increase the chaos, there is a suicide-mode where you race the course in the opposite direction of the other cars.  Up to 4 players can play the game in split screen mode.  Tracks include a tight Stadium course, an abandoned mine, jungle, and desert.    One trick to increase performance is that the buttons that rock the car upright, can also be used to prevent flipping in tight corners. Mud, dirt, snow, and water are kicked up behind the car to add some graphical flair.  The cars in the game are not licensed vehicles.</desc>

It is the year of Cheese, and the advent of the Comet of Infinite Possibilities is foretold by the great prophet Nosewasinit.

The evil Goon Queen Zorrscha wants to use the comet for her own plans, so our heroes have to reach it first...  The gameplay is similar to that of the first game; despite the 3D graphics, the gameplay mechanics are those of 2D platformers. The player can select Nikki or Fargus for each level. Each of the two has different abilities. For example, Nikki can jump higher, while Fargus can use his puppet Sid for a variety of attacks. The characters can also acquire power-ups, such as fire and lightning ranged attacks for Nikki or various Sid enhancements for Fargus. There are also level-specific items and vehicles the heroes will encounter on their way.</desc>

You'll fly through different territories and encounter familiar races from the popular television series, including Klingons, Romulans, Borg and a new enemy known as the Kam'Jahtae.

The story begins when Bat and Lynn are about to marry and Lynn is kidnapped by Jado (which resembles Jagger of the first series of "Hokuto no Ken"), a disciple of the "Dark Hokuto" The Dark Fist of Deceased Light, using a technique called Hokuto Mumyo Ken, a technique older than Hokuto Shinken itself. Then Ken (who is retired in a cave) is attacked by an henchmen of this martial arts school. After defeating him, Ken decides to investigate.

The player watches the development of plot in long Anime-like cutscenes and takes an active role only during the simple turn-based battles. The player chooses his actions from a menu. A time bar marks the flow of the turns. When the battle is won, another cutscene starts, etc. The game is divided in levels and a password is given after beating each of those.</desc>

		<desc>The protagonist of the previous two games was officially assigned a name in WCIII, Colonel Christopher Blair (Mark Hamill). The opening cutscene, the first FMV cutscene in the Wing Commander series, depicts a saddening scene: Thrakhath nar Kiranka (John Rhys-Davies), Crown Prince of the hostile Kilrathi Empire, presiding over the execution by disintegration of a group of Terran Confederation prisoners of war. One, however, is left alive: Blair's lover Colonel Jeannette "Angel" Devereaux (Yolanda Jilot), due to her status among the Kilrathi as a respected warrior, who is executed by Prince Thrakhath using his claws to disembowel her (though her death scene is not shown until later in the game). The scene then cuts to the planet Vespus, where Blair and Brigadier General James "Paladin" Taggart inspect the downed wreckage of the TCS Concordia. The carrier is a total loss.</desc>
