		<name>Acrobat Mission</name>
		<desc>Years ago humanity abandoned the over-polluted Earth to make a new home on Mars. Now, without warning, a mechanical moon has appeared in the skies over Mars, and is raining down destruction on the colonies. A plan is hastily put into action to destroy the moon and its armada of space-craft. Due to the impossible task of surviving a direct assault, the mission is code-named Acrobat Mission.

Your spaceship in Acrobat Mission is capable of firing a single straight ahead shot. By picking up a Wide upgrade, more shots are added that fly off at an angle, and the shot can be charged up to unleash a continuous short range cone of energy. Picking up a Hurricane upgrade will cause bullets to circle you defensively before shooting forward, and charging will store a full round of bullets up to be fired straight ahead all at once. Up to two bombs can be held at once, and if an enemy bullet hits a bomb it will detonate, saving your ship from damage. If your ship is hit, however, then you will have a few seconds to ram it into whatever shot you and take them down with you. Unlike most scrolling shooter games contact with an enemy ship will not kill you, but they can still push you into the path of bullets.

Play takes place over five levels, first of your launch on Mars, then the approach to the moon, and finally infiltrating the base to destroy its core. Each level ends with a unique boss except stage 4, which ends with 3 bosses.</desc>

		<desc>Action Pachio is a game featuring the Pachio-kun character in a straightforward side-scrolling platform game, rather than the usual pachinko. The game is somewhat reminiscent of Sonic the Hedgehog, as Pachio will often roll through areas at speed.

Pachio-kun made several more appearances on the Super Famicom, but most of them are in his core pachinko-playing series.</desc>

		<desc>ActRaiser was one of the early SNES games, drawing upon the success of side-scrolling platform action titles and the building model of Sim City. You play "The Master" (essentially God), and must save the world from evil. 

First you purge the land by sending your spirit into a warrior with a big sword and magic powers. This side scrolling portion puts you in many different locales, from swamps and forests, to pyramids and snowy mountaintops. 

As you eliminate evil from different parts of the land, you allow villagers to return and build their towns. You then control an angel who helps guide the villagers in their town building, and can send down miracles to aid them in their needs.</desc>

		<desc>American Battle Dome for Super Famicom, by Tsukuda Original. It looks pretty great as a video game ? just a sort of four-player pinball thing, like a pinball version of Warlords or something.

It?s based on a real Crossfire-esque board game ? which I?d never heard of, but looks completely badass. I assumed the board game never came out in Japan, hence the ?American? in the Super Famicom title, but nope: the board game was released with the same title, with a cute little face on the top!</desc>

But now the followers of Castomira stole it, and the world is facing a great peril...

This is a  Gauntlet-like game: lots of action and magic, with items to collects, and many dungeons to free from monsters. The game is also viewed from an isometric perspective, typical for the genre. Choose one of four characters to battle your way through dungeons and castles, or play with a friend in a 2-player mode.</desc>

		<desc>Ugoku E Ver. 2.0: Aryol ("Ugoku" means "to move") is a 1994 Super Famicom puzzle game published by Altron and developed by an unknown contract developer. It is a spiritual sequel to Altron's Olivia's Mystery, released earlier the same year. Like that game, Aryol features an ongoing story that is occasionally interrupted with a jigsaw puzzle the player must solve to continue the plot. The puzzle that the player must construct is constantly in motion, which can help and disorient the player in equal measure. In addition, there are "fake" pieces that will cause the puzzle to break apart if added in lieu of the real pieces.The story of Aryol involves a mysterious green-clad thief and his female partner, who is dressed in a French policeman's outfit, as they attempt to rob banks to pay for her flying career. The plot heavily features an airship known as the Aryol, which lends its name to the game. </desc>

		<desc>Asameshimae Nyanko has similarities with Reversi (or Othello) and with fights that are similar to rock-paper-scissors to intercept additional moves with kittens that have different proficiency with vertical/horizontal and diagonal moves.
In the game, players partake in a Reversi-esque game and get to choose a number of stages to play on and the type of kitten they want to use. They can also change the rules and settings to an extent. It's red versus blue, with a random player going first. As players would in Reversi or Othello, sandwich kittens vertically, horizontally or diagonally (though since the game is isometric, it's hard to say vertically or horizontally). They will change all the kittens in between to a certain color, but can additionally select cats in the area to do battle with. Winning allows players to further convert cats to their cause. There are special items which have certain effects such as making players lose a turn, but, there isn't much interruption from them.</desc>

		<desc>The kingdom of Kahna is in great danger. The evil Emperor Sauzer, obsessed by his world domination ideas, is preparing to invade the kingdom. The king sends his best troops of knights and wizards to face the enemy, but in vain - the kingdom is conquered by Sauzer, the king is murdered, and his lovely daughter is kidnapped. You were brave, Leader of the Dragon Squad, but now you will have to become strong. Remember the promise you gave the princess long time ago: always to be at her side. Supported by his friends and by his faithful dragons, you must now free the princess and the kingdom from the enemy's hands. If only the strongest of the dragons, Bahamut, could be awakened...

Bahamut Lagoon, created by the company which gave us the Final Fantasy games, is a mixture of turn-based strategy and RPG. Control several parties of four characters each, and command different dragons at once. The battles start on a top-down screen typical for strategy games, but often switch to a dynamic "platform" view, such as used in early console RPGs. You also can influence the game by other strategic activities, such as, for example, setting a whole forest on fire, to prevent enemies to come through it.</desc>

		<desc>Bakutou Dodgers is a Japan-only action game for up to four players. It superficially resembles Hudson's Bomberman series, with its top-down grid stages and chaotic gameplay, but rather than leaving bombs and waiting for them to explode, the player can shoot energy at blocks and each other.

The goal is to sneak up behind the opponent and shoot them before they can reciprocate. Various power-ups may appear after destructible blocks are removed, which can give the player an edge or, in the case of the ? icon, a possible random negative effect like reversed controls. There are also wandering monsters that can cause damage to anyone they come in contact with. Every combatant has a health bar which depletes at a rate dependent on the attacks they are getting hit by.

The single-player mode involves fighting through various worlds and removing all enemy combatants from the field to progress.</desc>

		<name>Battle Jockey</name>
		<desc>Battle Jockey is a racing game for up to four players that was developed by Nova and published by Virgin Interactive exclusively in Japan for the Super Famicom.It features horseracing, a far more popular pastime in Japan than elsewhere, and presents three separate modes: the first is the standard single-player story mode, in which the player takes a horse and jockey through training and races; the second is a battle mode which pits up to four players against each other in races that have far more power-ups and other unusual additions to the game's courses; and the third is a passive gambling mode in which the player puts money down on horses depending on their odds of winning and subsequent payouts and then watches the race play out with CPU players.The standard mode involves carefully managing the horse's stamina: being too aggressive will cause it to rear up in protest. Falling behind or running into a hedge or jump will cause the horse to lose stamina, and losing all stamina causes it to collapse briefly. The player needs to keep a steady pace, steer carefully around corners, jump at the right times and use the boost sparingly in order to win. In the battle mode stamina is less of a concern and the game more resembles RC Pro-Am: the players have to simply follow the course and avoid the dangers as they show up.</desc>

He can either play Bingo through a slot machine, while skydiving, aplay a game of Bingo with Santa Claus, and an option to play Bingo on a pirate ship. There is also arm wrestling and a mode where players get to make imaginary wagers on the horses in case the player does not like Bingo. However, the numbers are announced in Japanese rather than English, so knowledge of Japanese numbers is vital for multiplayer action. Full card Bingo is mandatory for single player games but party games can use any variation of Bingo that the players consent to.

A party mode is present for two players.</desc>

		<path>./Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon - Another Story (Japan) (Translated En).zip</path>
		<name>Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon : Another Story</name>
		<desc>The game is based on the Japanese manga and animé series Bishoujo Senshi: Sailor Moon - "Bishoujo Senshi" roughly meaning "Pretty Young Girl Warrior". It is set in the 30th century, in a futuristic city Crystal Tokyo. In this city lives a totally ordinary (at first) fourteen-year old girl Usagi. When she meets a magical cat named Luna, she finds out that she is in fact a princess sent to the future in order to fight the minions of Darkness. She discovers within herself the power to transform into the hero of darkness, Sailor Moon, meets other warriors who help her on her quest, and fights the evil Queen Beryl, hostile aliens, and other foes.

The events of this game take place shortly after Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S, the fourth volume of the long-running series. A global peace is established in the universe, but lately suspicious things are happening. A strange meteorite is seen approaching the Earth. Street gangs and spies who work for a mysterious person called Apsu are seen in Crystal Tokyo. And the Mystic Silver Crystal, the Ginzuishou, which protects the city, is shaking! Usagi and her friends must now investigate the strange events and face the forces of Darkness once again.

The game is a console-style RPG in  Final Fantasy style (battles with your party to the right and the enemies to the left), with a battle system somewhat similar to that of  Chrono Trigger: you must form a party out of several available characters, make them participate in battles together, and learn powerful combo attacks.

Luna, a magical talking cat, contacts her and tells her she is in fact a Sailor Moon, one of the legendary Pretty Fighters - girls who fight the forces of darkness and protect the Kingdom of Moon. 

The game is based on the events of the animé that follow the victory of Usagi and her friends over the Queen Beryl. Peace has returned to the Moon Kingdom. But suddenly, a little girl named Chibiusa arrives from the future and says the future kingdom is threatened by the forces of the evil Prince Diamond. Looks like you are the only ones who can defeat him, and save the future Sailor Moon, Chibiusa's mother.

This is a beat-'em up game. You can play as either Usagi or any of her girlfriends, including Chibiusa. You move on a platform and fight the enemies by punching, kicking, and throwing them, and by using special abilities unique to each character. You can advance only after you have cleared an area from enemies.

		<name>Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S : Kondo wa Puzzle de Oshioki yo!</name>
		<desc>Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S: Kondoha Puzzle de Oshiokiyo is a falling block competitive puzzle game. Players begin by choosing from a selection of Sailor Moon licensed characters, each with a unique special attack. The player is presented with a board filled with colored blocks in three colors: red, blue and green. The goal is to remove all the blocks from play. Clicking on a block that touches several adjacent blocks of the same color will remove them all from play. As each player successfully clears blocks, they drop "black blocks" on their opponent as well as increase their power bar. Black blocks cannot be removed by normal means and disappear only when large ammounts of blocks are removed adjacent to them. As the power bar charges, players can unleash their special ability, often an attack on the other player.

This puzzle game is based on the "S" series of Sailor Moon and includes characters from there: Sailor Moon, Sailor Mars, Sailor Venus, Sailor Mercury, Sailor Jupiter, Chibiusa, Tuxedo Mask, Sailor Uranus, Sailor Neptune and Sailor Pluto.

		<desc>Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S: Kurukkurin is a competitive puzzle game featuring Sailor Moon licensed characters. Upon choosing a character (each with unique "special moves"), the player competes against an opponent.

The player moves their cursor over the clear hearts to turn them into one of four colors: red, yellow, blue and green. Sometimes "treasures" will show up on the board. When several hearts of the same color are adjacent to one another, the player can clear them... which pushes all the hearts (and treasures) down towards the bottom. The goal is to be the player with the most treasures to end the round.

Sailor Moon characters featured are primarily from the "S" Series and includes: Sailor Moon, Sailor Mars, Sailor Mercury, Sailor Venus, Sailor Jupiter, Chibius, Tuxedo Mask, Sailor Neptune, Sailor Uranus and Sailor Pluto.

By shooting a balloon adjacent to another of the same color, the player pops both simultaneously. By popping a large number of balloons simultaneously, they can create trash for the other player to clear - these appear as gray balloons that can't easily be popped directly but disappear when multiple balloons are popped near them.nnnnThe player can select between nine Sailor Guardians in the vs. mode (all except Saturn), but is restricted to Sailors Moon, Chibi Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter and Venus for the single-player story mode. Sailor Saturn appears in-game as an advisor, but is not playable. The game was followed by a sequel the following year: Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon Super S: Fuwa Fuwa Panic 2.

		<desc>A 1995 Japan-exclusive Captain Tsubasa video game developed and published by Bandai and was the final Captain Tsubasa game for the Super Famicom.
This game suffered lots of changes from previous games made by Tecmo, this time you will be playing in a real soccer field and in real time, which means that you need to press certain keys even without having the chance of stopping the time (like in previous games), When a certain player is confronted with a one that he considers his rival (like Misugi and Schneider or Tsubasa and *any other player*, for example) they will have a fight, which is mainly a button smashing sequence. The same goes for the sequence in which a goalkeeper tries to stop any of the special shots.
This game has almost the same story as the Captain Tsubasa J anime, except that this one will finish with a special match against an extra team. So, you'll play across various chapters, playing with Aoi Shingo in Italy or controlling the mythic Ozora Tsubasa in his match against the brazillian prodigy, Carlos Santana (nope, he isn't the singer). You'll also play with Japan national team against the same opponents as they did in the anime version..</desc>

		<desc>Caravan Shooting Collection is a 1995 Super Famicom compilation of classic shoot 'em up games from 1985 to 1987 that were originally released on the Nintendo Entertainment System. The games include the 1985 NES port of Star Force (the Arcade version was originally created by Tecmo, but the home port was developed by Hudson), 1986's Star Soldier and 1987's Hector (a.k.a. Starship Hector).All three of these games were the subjects of the Hudson All-Japan Caravan Festival, which for a long time hosted a new Hudson shoot 'em up every year and traveled around Japan with competitors in different prefectures attempting to earn the highest scores. The game would then be available for sale shortly before or after the competition, which helped raise its profile.</desc>

		<name>CB Chara Wars : Ushinawareta Gag</name>
		<desc>CB Chara Wars, sometimes written with the subtitle Ushinawareta Gag, is an RPG that features a crossover of sorts of Go Nagai's various manga franchises. These include Devilman and Mazinger Z, among others. The "CB" in the title refers to the term "chibi", which depicts characters as smaller and cuter than usual. In that sense, it is similar to the term SD (super deformation) found in several Super Famicokm Gundam game titles.CB Chara Wars began as an original video animation which first aired in 1991. A manga adaptation followed the following year, as did this game. Banpresto published the game in Japan, a company known for creating games with anime crossovers such as the Super Robot Taisen/Wars series.</desc>

The game is a loose collection of different mini-games and utilities intended for a younger audience, a dodgeball game set on a Bomberman grid, a painting game that plays like competitive Snake, and a sumo-like game on a floating platform in a pool.  It also features a single-player story mode, in which interstitial text-heavy story cutscenes set the stage for the mini-games, as well as modes that let up to four players try each mini-game directly.</desc>

		<name>Chinhai</name>
		<desc>Chinhai is a puzzle game for the Super Famicom and a variant on Mahjong Solitaire, or Shanghai. Instead of pairing and removing any two tiles that match as long as one of their sides is clear, as is the case in Shanghai, the rules of Chinhai require that the two tiles can only be removed if it's possible to draw a line between the two that doesn't make a 90 degree turn more than twice. Two tiles on opposite sides of the board, for instance, can't be paired because it would take three 90 degree turns to draw a line between them. To account for this added difficulty, the game lacks the "stacks" of tiles that frequently appear in Shanghai, instead presenting a flat board of tiles.Chinhai is named for the municipality of Chinhai in China, maintaining the theme of naming mahjong solitaire variants after territories in China. Chinhai has long since been renamed Zhenhai, which is situated in the Ningpo Prefecture and now part of a much larger city. This mahjong solitaire variant is perhaps best known as Sichuan or Shisenshou, also named for a province in China.</desc>

Instead of being another side-scrolling shooter, Bakuretsu Rantouden is actually a one-on-one 2D fighter a la Street Fighter in which the most recognizable characters from the Cho Aniki series (yes the speedo wearing bodybuilders included) fight each other for ultimate supremacy using special attacks and moves.

An interesting feature is that the game honors it's shooter roots, therefore instead of being restricted to walking backwards and forwards in the 2D plane and jumping around as in other fighting games, in this game all the characters can fly meaning the fights actually occur in mid-air allowing the players to dash all over the screen. Includes single player and 2-player vs modes.

		<desc>The magic world of Wozz, populated by magicians, alchemists, and other kinds of people - including simple town and village inhabitants - was a seemingly peaceful place, until one day, a poisonous rain started turning its inhabitants into monsters. The chief wizard realizes that the demon Balaam is trying to link the world of Wozz with the world of humans. Only a human hero can stop Balaam, and the wizard's teleporting magic brings... three young humans: the Japanese girl Reona Kitazato, and two boys: the American Shot Phoenix and the Chinese Chun Chingtao. Will those youngsters be able to stop Balaam?

The game is a traditional console-style RPG similar to Breath of Fire: turn-based battles are viewed from an isometric perspective. You control all three characters as a party, but in the beginning of the game you choose one of them as the main character, and therefore will see the game from his/her perspective. In case the characters split up, you'll be able to control only the one you chose.

		<name>Choujikuu Yousai Macross : Scrambled Valkyrie</name>
		<desc>The legend of the Valkyrie pilots is not yet over. Hikaru, Max, and Millia take flight to defend the earth from Zentraedi, robots, more robots, and giant space crab-bees. Now is the time to scramble Valkyrie again. 

When starting a game or continuing the player picks from either Hikaru, Max, or Millia. Each flies a custom Valkyrie with its own set weapon load-out. A Valkyrie changes its weapon and movement speed by switching between its three forms: Fighter, Gerwalk, and Battroid. Typically the Valkyrie weapon shoots straight and quickly, the Gerwalk weapon shoots around or through obstacles, and the Battroid weapon does higher damage in exchange for reduced firing rate. Each weapon can be upgraded up to twice by picking up power up items dropped by special enemy ships, but one level of power up will be lost any time the Valkyrie is shot. If a Valkyrie's entire life bar is depleted then the full stage must be repeated, provided the player still has enough continues.

In a nod to Galaga the player is able to capture some enemy craft to increase their firepower. If the player does not shoot any weapons for a few seconds a field of electricity will cover the Valkyrie. Touching some enemy ships will then cause their targeting to be shorted out and make them friendly to the player, following along and shooting or ramming onscreen enemies.

		<name>Columns</name>
		<desc>Columns is loosely derived from Tetris, as it involves arranging falling blocks in such a way as to clear them. However, in columns they are groups of 3 same-size but varying color blocks, which must be arranged into sequences of 3 or more, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Sequences of 4 or 5 count for double or triple points, and diagonal sequences score the most. The real trick is to set up 'combos' - where one line causes other blocks to drop so as to create other lines.

As well as the normal game mode, there is also a 'flash' mode, in which the aim is simply to remove a particular block from the base of the pre-formed pile of bricks. The difficulty of this can be determined by increasing the number of complete rows which are already in place.</desc>

Because the statue is needed for spring to come, the heroes Hyou and Kiyu go on an expedition to return the statue to its rightful place and restore order once more.
Coron Land consists of shooting enemies with the ray gun, throwing enemies, and throwing purple balls called Corons at enemies. Corons can either be generated from downed enemies (Quest Mode) or from random appearance (Battle Mode). Enemies are turned into corons after a certain amount of hits, but will return to their former forms if not dealt with after a certain amount of time. Once an enemy becomes a coron, players may either choose to immediately throw them as weapons or roll them to make them become bigger and cause more harm to enemies when thrown. This snowball effect also works for corons that are randomly dropped.</desc>

This game would become the basis of Namco's more well-known puzzle game Pac-Attack, featuring Pac-Man. As with Pac-Attack, the idea is to stack up a lot of the animated face icons (members of the Cosmo Gang) in an unbroken chain and then drop a bomb (shaped like an arrow) that goes down the chain and eliminates them all at once.</desc>

Shin-chan is always getting in trouble with his parents and saying bizarre or offensive things to everyone he meets. Every so often, though, he'll try to do what his mom wants him to, but more often than not, he'll misunderstand and simply confound his parents further.

Arashi o Yobu Enji ("A Kindergartner Called Tempest") is one of many games based on the manga and anime created by Yoshito Usui. In four stages, each made up of five areas, Shin-chan must explore his neighborhood looking for a specific object. He can enter houses to ask people for information, but will often end up simply insulting them. He must also avoid or knock over the other children in the neighborhood, and has various ability cards that he can use to assist him, which might give him a water pistol or refill his health. After finding what he's looking for, Shin-chan will move on to the next area.

Also included is a minigame mode with eight different minigames, such as a bubble-blowing contest, a three-legged race, and a desperate search for clothing before school. The entire game, including the minigames, is filled with dialogue containing the same humor as the source material.

The game is a standard side-scrolling 2D platformer - common with licensed games - though it is notable for letting players decide which order they want to tackle stages, not to mention the franchise's penchant for weird/gross-out humor.</desc>

But one day, several dark clouds appeared over the kingdom and poured down a devastating rain. And then one of the clouds turned into a demon, and, reaching its hands to the treasure room in the palace, took the crystal away. The demon lord, still in a form of a menacing dark cloud, started spawning monsters and sending them to attack the now helpless kingdom. The king called to the heavens for help. Eight magical weapons fell on the ground, and eight warriors rose to protect their country. Your task now is to cleanse the land of the monsters and to defeat the evil demon lord.

This group originally released an obscure game similar to this but with a wider audience in mind, various enhancements and alternate modes for PCs called "Endorfun" in 1995 in the U.S and Europe.Japanese developers seemed to like the concept and got permission to make something like it based on the original principals of Endorfun for the obscure Satellaview (or BS-X) and then later as a standalone release for the Super Famicom, where the game was called BS Cu-On-Pa and Cu-On-Pa, respectively. It would also get released later for Playstation.Published by T&amp;E Soft for the SFC late in 1996, Cu-On-Pa was also fan-translated sometime later for the emulation community, though the game comes with a rather straightforward tutorial and the game is very easy to understand, but difficult to master. This game is difficult to describe and in a league of its own.You play as a three-dimensional cube that must destroy all the "Life Panels" on a level. To do so, you have to rotate your cube and roll over the colored squares on the transparent field. Panels come in a variety of colors and the main way to elimate them is by having the color on the top of the cube match the color of the tile beneath you.The other way is for more skilled players and comes in the form of "Lightning Panels", which are generated when you destroy panels other than Life Panels. Destroy enough of them and you'll have lots of them. Then go and destroy a life panel! What will happen is, all lightning panels will explode that match the color of the life panel you rolled over. Moreover, the explosion spreads and detonates other tiles in the vicinity, which can spread and create a chain reaction. It's up to you how you wish to rack up points, either by time, chains, or both.Ken Kojima was the music composer.</desc>

		<name>Cyber Knight II : Chikyuu Teikoku no Yabou</name>
		<desc>Following the events of the first Cyber Knight in the 24th century, the crew of the Swordfish have returned to Earth after defeating the mechanical "Berzerkers" far across space. However during their time away, the Earth Federation has been taken over by the ambitious General Forrest, who seeks to wage war on the independent systems and conquer them. Recognizing the potential weapons that could be made from the Berzerker science data, Forrest impounds the Swordfish and jails it's crew. The Berzerker data is used to create "Overtech" and bring to life "Metalliforms", self-replicating war machines. The Swordfish crew manages to escape, thanks to a mysterious agent "CJ", and are recruited into the resistance against the Earth Federation. Given a new spaceship, the Galvodirge, they must travel the galaxy to different human civilizations and devise a plan to stop Earth's attack.

Cyber Knight II is an RPG with science-fiction themes. As in the first game, much of the game takes place in a top-down view for movement on planets and areas, a side-view for combat sequences and a first person menu system when aboard the Galvodirge starship. The Galvodirge can travel between stars, scanning worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, the crew can debark either on foot or using combat modules (mechs). Some areas are only accessible using modules and others (such as towns) do not allow the use of these war machines. Many planets will have towns or people living on them which can be talked to in order to uncover information. Different quests are assigned in order to find the items necessary to progress. There is no system of currency or buying items. Instead, many defeated enemies leave behind "NeoParts", which can be brought back to the Swordfish's lab. Analysis of these Neo parts unlocks enhances statistics (endurance, agility, accuracy, etc) for the Modules and new weapons for them to carry. 

The crew are divided into a three person "combat team" and a three person "support team". If modules are used, they can be assigned from the ship's hanger. Unlike the first game, modules only perform a combat or a support role, and each is unique in statistics and the type of weaponry it can carry. When combat occurs on the main map, the support team will often deliver the first strike by firing missiles into the enemies. When searching facilities, caves or other locations, the support team is not available. Following either case, the combat team engages the enemy in turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen from the side view, the three modules can be positioned in relation to enemies in order to attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged weaponry. Ammunition is unlimited, but each module also carries a number of "options" that are consumable attacks. Each Module has two sets of hitpoints: one for the pilot and one for the module itself. If either one of these reaches zero, the module is destroyed. In order to heal, the party carries 10 each of repair kits and first aid kits, which must when not in combat. These kits, as well as options and defeated pilots or modules can be restored by returning to the Galvodirge.</desc>

In desperation, the crew activate their jump drive without a destination... and end up flung across the galaxy to the galactic core. The Swordfish however is badly damaged with many casualties including the captain. Only 26 of the crew survive, and of them only 6 are qualified for combat: The commander, two soldiers, a mechanic and a doctor and six giant "Module" mechanized suits available for them. These survivors locate planet Farworld, apparently colonized by humans. There they discover the colony is under attack by a relentless mechanical aliens dubbed "Berserkers". The crew of the swordfish must fight back against the Berserkers and explore the galaxy for some means to return home.

Cyber Knight is an RPG with a science-fiction theme of being lost in an alien galaxy. The game takes place in a top-down view for movement on planets and areas, a side-view for combat sequences and a first person menu system when aboard the Swordfish starship. The Swordfish can travel between stars, scanning worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, three crew members piloting three Modules (giant robots) can be selected to debark and explore the planet.

		<name>Cyborg 009</name>
		<desc>Nine young people were turned into cyborgs by a company trying to take over the world. They have defeated this company and are now using their super powers to protect the world.

Based on the manga/anime by the same name, Cyborg 009 is a side-scrolling platformer in which the player takes control of 8 different cyborgs, using their special abilities to complete several missions. 

Their special abilities are as follows:
002 can fly and hover in the air; 003 can see in the dark; 004 can fire bullets from his fingers and rockets from his knees; 005 can break rocks with his fists; 006 can blow fire that also melts rocks; 007 can take on different shapes including those of enemies; 008 can swim underwater for extended periods of time; 009 can move at very high speeds. (001 is a baby and can't be taken on missions). Using these special abilities consumes SP that slowly regenerate. 

In addition to their special abilities, the cyborgs also have four attributes that govern their attack and defensive powers, their amount of SP and SP regeneration speed. 

Before every mission, one cyborg is assigned leader and two more can be selected by the player. Only one cyborg can be controlled at a time, but it is possible to switch between cyborgs at any time. All cyborgs share the same HP and SP-bar. Throughout the levels, experience points can be collected and used to increase a cyborg's attributes after a completed mission.</desc>

		<name>Dark Law : Meaning of Death</name>
		<desc>Three-hundred years ago, there were two kingdoms on the earth -Reyfore, ruled by the benevolent and mighty king Reynard, and Amugnon, ruled by king Daruk. The two kingdoms could have lived in peace, but pride took over king Daruk, he didn't respect the Goddess any more, and as a result his mind became obsessed by the idea of destruction. Daruk attacked Reyfore, and for decades war was embracing the two kingdoms, setting the Earth in flames. After a prolonged battle, king Reynard defeated king Daruk, and a reign of prosperity began once again.

But can evil be truly defeated? The hero of the game, a young adventurer, falls down from a cliff while taking a stroll near the ancient Sophia Temple. He is saved by an old man who lives with his daughter Refia in a small country house. But one day, a demonic-looking knight appears, accompanied by monsters, kills the old man, and kidnaps Refia. The old man recognized the knight - it was king Daruk! Now the hero must bring Refia back and defeat Daruk once and for all.

The game has a less linear structure than a standard console-style RPG: together with the main story there are many missions, or "scenarios", which are not obligatory to complete, but which occupy a large portion of the game. In the beginning of the game you create a party of four characters, the hero and his three companions. The battles are pre-determined and take place on the same screen as the gameworld itself. Your party and the enemies can move freely around the screen and attack with melee and ranged weapons, and their actions depend on the amount of action points they have. Navigation in town is menu-based.</desc>

		<desc>Dear Boys is a 1994 Super Famicom basketball game based on the manga of the same name. The game features both a story mode, which follows the plot of the manga, and an exhibition mode that allows the player to go straight into a match.

The game features a "dramatic" perspective that is also slightly turn-based, similar to the Captain Tsubasa games. A window demonstrates what is happening - a ball is passed, a shot is thrown, the tip-off - in dramatic comic book style that is reminiscent of the manga. While a player's athlete has the ball, the player can pull up a menu that allows them to choose to pass, shoot or look at the present characters stats - each character has their own strengths and weaknesses that the player should keep in mind.</desc>

		<desc>"Der Langrisser" is a sequel to the game that was known outside of Japan as  Warsong, and is in fact a remake of the Genesis game  Langrisser II.

The Blue Dragon Knights of the Rayguard Empire are trying to steal the virtuous sorceress Riana. Their goal is to make her serve the evil Emperor Bozel, whose intention is to find the most powerful evil sword in the land, the Alhazard. Naturally, the main hero of the game, the knight Elwin, has not only to rescue Riana, but to retrieve the legendary holy sword Langrisser, the only artifact that is more powerful than Alhazard. At first, Elwin automatically follows the "good" path, but as the game progresses, he can choose whether to continue being good, to become an ally with Rayguard, or to side with the forces of Chaos whose goal is utter destruction.

"Der Langrisser" features a complex character creation process, during which you must answer morally ambiguous questions,  Ultima-style, that will determine the class and the attributes of the main hero. The game is a strategy RPG in which you control your party only during battles. You just hire soldiers and unite them under commands of generals. When your units attack the enemy, an automatic battle sequence occurs. You can also use magic spells to heal your troops or to harm enemy soldiers.</desc>

The game comes with a built-in "demo" project: Daioh Gale, a pseudo-sequel to Athena's 1983 Arcade game Daioh.

Dezaemon is a rebuilt version of Athena's original 1991 Famicom game Game Designer Yusei Soft: Dezaemon. This version of Dezaemon would later see an enhanced PlayStation edition named Dezaemon Plus in 1996, which in 2010 became the first Dezaemon game available in the US when it was added to the US PSN store.</desc>

		<desc>Dharma Doujou was originally released in the arcades by Metro3D in 1994 (picture on the left). While the original version provides the same gameplay as the Super Famicom version tested here, the game does have some noticeable differences. First of all, it has more enemies and features colorful backgrounds borrowed from traditional Japanese themes and myths (well, in the Korean version of the game, Metro3D apparently threw in a couple of bikini girls for good measure). Additionally, the arcade game only contains a story mode and there is no progress map or alternate game modes like in the Super Famicom port. But, most importantly, the gameplay is slightly different - the player has to move the character around the screen in order to hit a block with the mallet. The Super Famicon version, on the contrary, automatically aligns the player with the furthest most block, and this apparently minor difference makes the gameplay of the home conversion more fast-paced and enjoyable than the original.</desc>

Certain blocks, gray in color, cannot be removed unless they're touching five colored blocks as they vanish: the goal is to quickly fire five blocks to remove these before they reach the player character at the bottom of the screen. There are also random power-ups that can be acquired. The blocks have facial expressions that change depending on the number of similar blocks they're touching, allowing the player to see how close they are to clearing them if the top of the screen cuts it off.

		<desc>King K. Rool has stolen Donkey Kong's banana stash, and Donkey Kong needs your help to get them back. In search of K. Rool, the Kremling horde impedes your progress. Kremlings, crocodile-like creatures, include Kritters (they succumb to a simple jump on the head), Krushas (they are virtually indestructible), and others. There are also other enemies that block your path, such as beavers, snakes, vultures. Leading them are dastardly bosses, including Very Gnawty, Necky, Bumble B, and Dumb Drum, and they all bar the way with their own special blend of villainy.

Donkey Kong is joined by Diddy Kong: these two primates differ significantly. For example, Donkey Kong is generally stronger; he can destroy most enemies with a single jump and can lift barrels straight over his head to throw them farther. On the other hand, Diddy is faster and not as strong as Donkey; he can run really fast and do cartwheels. Diddy carries barrels in front of him, creating a shield against frontal attacks.

The game is split into different worlds, which are split into different levels. Each level contains bonus areas, where one can collect bananas, medallions, and lives. At the end of each world is a boss, which is usually a larger version of a minor enemy.</desc>

		<path>./Doraemon - Nobita to Yousei no Kuni (Japan).zip</path>
		<name>Doraemon : Nobita to Yousei no Kuni</name>
		<desc>The game is based on the animé series "Doraemon". Doraemon is a blue robotic cat who has the ability to enter dream world and to help the people who live there. In this game, Nobita, a bespectacled friend of Doraemon's, suddenly meets a little fairy. Long ago, humans and fairies lived together in peace, but since the humans started developing their technology, the fairies have no place any more. Nobita and Doraemon travel to the dream world to find out how can they help.

The game is divided into adventure and platform action modes. In adventure mode, you navigate Doraemon from a top-down view, talking to people and entering houses. When you have gathered enough information, a place on the map will be highlighted. If Doraemon (or other characters, later in the game) enters this place, a platform action section begins. In platform mode, Doraemon must overcome the obstacles and defeat enemies by jumping on them or by throwing magic dusk at them, in order to retrieve important items.

In the future, his grandson uses a time machine and send the cat-like robot Doraemon to protect Nobita. In this adventure, Nobita, Doraemon, and their friends travel to the Toys Land. Some evil toys are threatening this country, and it's up to our heroes to help its inhabitants.

The game is divided into adventure and platform action modes. In adventure mode, Doraemon walks around towns, talking to people and entering houses. Key locations lead to platform levels, which must be completed to advance the story. Platform levels include plenty of obstacles (pits, spikes, self-destructing platforms etc.), as well as various enemies who try to stop the heroes. You can choose one of the six available characters to play through the platform level. They all can jump and defeat enemies either by jumping on their heads or by using long-ranged weapons.

This is an action platform game with adventure elements. You can control Doraemon, Nobita, and other characters, traveling through platform levels, defeating or avoiding enemies. Each character has his own weapon and possesses a special ability (for example, Suneo can crawl through narrow spaces, etc.) which is often required to complete a stage. In present time, you travel through Nobita's town in top down view, talking to characters and entering houses. There is also a slight RPG element in the game, as you can buy items and upgrade your weapons.

		<name>Do-Re-Mi Fantasy : Milon no Dokidoki Daibouken</name>
		<desc>A young boy named Milon sets off to save Alis, his fairy friend, after she was captured by the evil sorcerer Amon. He later learns that the only way to defeat Amon is by collecting five legendary instruments which Amon has stolen.  The sorcerer placed a curse on these instruments so that their true powers cannot be used and then left them in the hands of his minions.  The only way to lift the curse is by collecting five stars.

Armed with only his bubble shooter, Milon must retrieve the legendary instruments, lift their curses and use their powers to defeat Amon and rescue Alis.

Traveling through many different worlds starting with the forest, Milon will be confronted by many enemies. Milon can either shoot bubbles to trap and send his enemies away, or he can jump and flatten his enemies temporarily turning them into a platform for him to walk across.  

Milon has three different "outfits": red, blue, and green.  With the green outfit, Milon can withstand three hits.  Each time he gets hit, he will be downgraded a color - green to blue, blue to red.  If he gets hit with the red outfit, he will die and have to start the level over.

By collecting 100 music notes, Milon will get an extra life.  There are also other useful items to get like bubble gum that will save Milon once if he were to fall, a special bubble shooter that let's him shoot multiple bubbles at once and a star that makes Milon temporarily invincible so that he can defeat enemies simply by running at them.</desc>

		<name>Dossun! Ganseki Battle</name>
		<desc>A falling block puzzle game  in a pseudo-medieval fantasy setting that pits two characters against each other in an abstract form of combat that is quite similar to games like Columns. Combining at least three matching symbols in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal line does not only clear them off the screen, but also deals damage to an opponent. This means that players do not only have to keep their game area clear, but also pay attention to their characters health bar. Once a block touches the top of the screen or the health bar is diminished the game ends.

There are four different icons that have different effects when combined:
Books, swords and rocks deal damage to an opponent by attacking with fireballs, dragons or swords.
Bottles heal a certain amount of health.
Purple blocks have no effect, but clog up the screen nonetheless.

Chain reactions result in particularly powerful attacks or place one or more grey blocks inside the opponents area. They can be destroyed just like ordinary blocks, but they always stay in the same spot and do not fall down.

More complex chain reactions give access to special attacks, up to three of which can be held and activated with the shoulder buttons. Special attacks have different effects that include clearing all purple blocks, using all potions and clearing the bottom three lines.

The game features a single play, Vs and Tournament/story mode. The gameplay itself  is similar to other baseball games in the sense that it subdivides the different stages of baseball (batting, pitching, running bases, etc.) in different "mini games" with their own camera angles and interfaces.

As expected of a Nekketsu game you can play it rough by sneaking punches and kicks to "bend" the rules a bit, you can also use the "ki" or willpower of your players to trigger special moves and strategic management is limited to specifying different base strategies and behaviors for each player.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Ball Z : Super Saiya Densetsu</name>
		<desc>Cho Saiya Densetsu is based on the popular manga/animé series Dragon Ball. It follows the events described in the beginning of Dragon Ball Z, the second story block, which tells about the connection of the hero Son Goku with a powerful alien race, and new mighty foes from far away planets. The game starts just where the tale of Dragon Ball begins. Son Goku goes to meet his friends, but is stopped by a mysterious stranger named Raditz who tells Son Goku they are relatives. Raditz demands from him to destroy humanity, and as Son Goku refuses, takes his son Son Gohan hostage. To rescue his son, Son Goku joins forces with his arch-rival, the Demon King Piccolo, who obviously has his own plans concerning Raditz. And thus begins the story during which Son Goku will learn of his true origin...

The game is a RPG similar to the card-based Dragon Ball Z RPGs for NES. During battles, you choose cards from your card inventory, which determine the nature and the strength of your characters' attacks. You can also train your characters in training houses and upgrade their special Ki power. Unlike early DBZ RPGs, you can move around freely in Cho Saiya Densetsu, and your movements are not determined by cards. You can also fly around the world and use your special Dragon Radar to discover location of magical Dragon Balls.

In Dragon Quest (known as Dragon Warrior in the US), you play as the descendant of the legendary warrior Erdrick, and your goal is to recover the magical Ball of Light from Erdrick's and the humanity's arch-enemy, the Dragon Lord. In Dragon Quest II, you assume the role of the descendant of the hero of the first game, and must join forces with two other characters in order to defeat a demon lord who destroyed a nearby city and killed its inhabitants. 

Both RPGs feature random battles and turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. In Dragon Quest you fight alone, while in the sequel two other characters can join your party, and you also fight against multiple enemies at once.

The remake includes updated graphics (although they still retain the original NES look), sound of SNES quality, and some changes in the gameplay and in the game world. Certain locations are larger, some menu commands (such as "Stairs") are omitted, and there is a larger variety of items.

		<desc>Dragon Warrior III is the concluding game of the first Dragon Quest/Dragon Warrior trilogy, and its story takes us back to the time period of the legendary Erdrick (also known as Loto), the ancestor of the first game's hero. You are the son of a powerful warrior Ortega, skillful in physical combat and spellcasting. Your father went out to fight the evil Baramos, who is responsible for the appearance of monsters in your region, and never returned. You are sent by the king on a quest to continue your father's brave deeds and to defeat Baramos.

Dragon Warrior III is a top-down role-playing game where you travel around the overworld, caves, castles, cities and other locations while battling random encounters, buying equipment, and talking to people. You and your party members receive experience when they beat up monsters and level up with enough experience, increasing their stats. The game features a day/night cycle - as you travel, day slowly changes to night and vice versa; shops are typically closed at night. 

You begin with control of just the main character but can quickly recruit three more members to your party. During the game you can choose to drop your current characters and recruit others at any time. The recruitable characters are divided into six classes: soldier, fighter, merchant, goof-off, pilgrim and wizard.

The game has a unique job system, giving you the ability to switch your hired characters' classes after they have achieved at least level 20 in their base class. Characters can switch to the other beginning classes, as well as the sage class, which is not available at the beginning. When a character switches classes, they lose all earned experience points, and half of their stats, but retain all of the abilities of the previous class. In this way, you can create powerful combination characters that are able to cast spells and fight effectively.

It appears that your mother died just after giving birth to you, and your father took you on a long journey when you were a little baby, and all you know is that he was searching for something. Now you are six years old, and Lord Papas brings you to your home village. After some time, you learn that His Highness Prince Henry was kidnapped by bandits. Your father attempts to rescue him, and during this action you discover that perhaps your mother is still alive... The game follows the story of Papas' son, and this story is stretched over years, as the hero grows and becomes a man of courage and virtue. During the game, the hero will discover the truth about his mother, and will have to make some crucial decisions, such as which girl to marry (the decisions affect the course of the game and its ending).

"Dragon Quest V" is a party RPG with turn-based combat, and battles viewed from 1st person perspective, just like all its predecessors. Your party roams about the world, fighting random enemies, performing quests, and defeating bosses. The novelty is in the game's unusual story, which spans almost a lifetime of the hero. 

"Dragon Quest V" was not available outside of Japan until 2009, when the DS version was released in the United States.

Like its immediate predecessor  Dragon Quest V, this game was never released outside Japan.

		<name>Dream Maze : Kigurumi Daibouken</name>
		<desc>A young boy has a strange dream every night, where a voice calls him. In this dream there's a magical kingdom called Enderia. The queen of Enderia and her daughters were kidnapped by the demon Akuma, who now reigns supreme. The boy must enter the dreamworld, defeat the demon and rescue the nobility.

Yume Meiky?: Kigurumi Daib?ken is a first-person dungeon crawler with step-movement and random encounters that plays like a simplified version of the Dungeon Master series template, albeit with a turn-based engine. One of the main differences is the presentation: instead of the usual dank and dark dungeon with grim walls covered by rusty chains, this game has surfaces made of cake and candy. Instead of skeletons and orcs as enemies, it features furry and cute anthropomorphic animals. Once defeated, these creatures occasionally leave behind their skin, which the hero can collect and wear for a change in statistics and new abilities. They also sometimes drop candy, the game's currency. There are several shops on each level: a tailor shop to change and store skins (it is possible to carry a maximum of six skins), shops for potions and health boosts, etc.

When a random enemy encounter occurs, a menu with the options of fighting or escaping appears. After choosing to fight, another menu pops up, which includes the commands Punch, Kick, Talent, Defend, and Item. After choosing either of the first two the player is presented with a grid where an icon (a fist or a foot) can be positioned over a part of the enemy body. This provides a strategic element to the game, as different enemies have different weak spots that can be exploited. The Talent option accesses the special ability that a skin may possess.</desc>

		<name>Drift King Shutokou Battle 2 : Tsuchiya Keiichi &amp; Bandou Masaaki</name>
		<desc>A behind-the-car driving game exclusive.

Players select a car and customize it before taking it to the track to race against other street racing enthusiasts. The game maintains a split-screen regardless of whether or not a second player is involved; on single-player, the top screen's camera stays on the starting line.



The game is the sequel to Drift King Shutouku Battle '94. Genki would continue the Shutokou Battle series beyond the Super Famicom with PlayStation entries like Tokyo Highway Battle and the Tokyo Xtreme Racer series for Dreamcast and PS2.</desc>

		<name>Dual Orb II</name>
		<desc>Long time ago, a flourishing civilization was destroyed by the rage of a mighty dragon. The Earth was set in flames, and no one escaped the destruction - no one except one man, who managed to launch himself forward, thousand years into the future. There, he was found by people of Kardosa Empire, who soon understood they have in their hands a human who possesses the secret of a superior ancient technology, that was unknown to the primitive civilization of the present...

You play the role of Aleth, the son of the High Priest in the small kingdom of Garade, whom leads a peaceful life with his friend Lagnus, Prince of Garade. One day Aleth accidentally gains possession of a precious artifact which is sought after by the Kardosa Empire. Aleth and Lagnus get involve in a conflict which will soon lead them to great discoveries of the secrets of the ancient civilization, of the great destruction that occurred thousand years ago, and of their own true identities...

The game is a console-style RPG: your party meets randomly encountered enemies and bosses, and fights them in turn-based combat viewed from isometric perspective. You upgrade armor by buying it, and also can buy weapons, but weapons can also be upgraded for money to different levels, to create powerful attacks called "techs".</desc>

While adopting the same behind-the-batter perspective as Namco's Famista series, Dynamic Stadium presents its athletes as comic book heroes rather than chibi figures, making them absurdly buff and frequently featuring action shots of them catching fly-balls and narrowly making it to base before being caught out. "Safe!" and "Out!" calls are presented as spiky word balloons.

Dynamic Stadium does not feature an official NPB license, so all the team names are fictitious. The game was published in Japan by Sammy Corporation and was never localized for overseas territories.</desc>

		<name>Edono Kiba</name>
		<desc>Tokyo, 2050 AD. Terrorists are running wild in the streets, and only one armored police officer is fast enough to hunt them down.

In Edo no Kiba you are always moving forward, either running or walking (or, in some levels, flying), although you can still move around the screen as in most belt-scrolling games. Your avatar attacks by slashing to the right with his energy sword, and he can also hold his sword defensively to deflect some bullets. By then holding forward and releasing attack he can throw the sword like a boomerang. He can also jump. A bomb follows the avatar around on any on-foot level that can be used to destroy all enemies onscreen at any time, and it will be replaced whenever a life is lost. Environments range from city streets to sewers and a flying battleship. Each level ends with a boss fight against an enemy that can withstand many attacks.</desc>

		<desc>In "Emerald Dragon", you play as Atrushan, a blue dragon who lives in the Dragon World. One day, he and his friends discover a ship wreck near a mountain. After examining the wreck, the dragons find a human child - a little girl. The wise White Dragon, the leader of the dragons, tells them that her name is Tamryn and that she will play an important role in their lives. The girl doesn't remember anything, and grows up together with the dragons. But when she turns fifteen, she decides to go back to her homeland - the Human World. Soon after Tamryn has left, Atrushan realizes he can't bear the separation, and asks the White Dragon to allow him to go and find Tamryn in the Human World. But a mysterious evil curse has been placed on the dragons - they can't appear among the humans in their true form. Atrushan agrees to become a human and goes to the Human World - to find Tamryn, and also a way to remove the curse...

The game features traditional Japanese-style RPG gameplay - Atrushan and his party travel over world map, visiting towns and descending into dungeons. The battle system is somewhat unusual - you can control only Atrushan, while other party members are controlled by the AI. You have a special bar for your actions in battle: once it is depleted, you can't perform any action and must wait for your next turn. You can move freely over the battle field, position yourself strategically near or far away from the enemy, attack from different sides, and assign general strategies to your non-controllable party members.</desc>

		<name>Feda : The Emblem of Justice</name>
		<desc>In a fantasy world, a soldier from the imperial forces deserts after witnessing the massacre of innocent villagers by his unit. He is sent to jail to be executed, but manages to escape with the help of two former unit colleagues. The group flees through the country-side, while being pursued by imperial soldiers. On their way, they join forces with other rebels to fight against the enemy, while uncovering hidden secrets and evil plots by the Empire.

FEDA: Emblem of Justice is a strategy RPG similar to Shining Force and other titles with preset characters and linear gameplay. The player commands a party of varying size and characters with diverse skills.

In the main battle sections, the player and the CPU-controlled enemy take turns moving the troops and giving orders. A menu at the bottom of the screen shows all the possible actions, where soldiers can defend, move, attack, or use an inventory item on each turn. The range of their movements and weapons vary according to their nature. A crossbow character can shoot from the back, while most sword and knife users have to be adjacent to their targets. Magic offensive powers have different ranges as well, reaching enemies that are far away from the attacking character. Health points can be recovered by eating rations or by magic, where a healer can restore points to several characters at once.

Each party member has separate health and magic points, as well as other statistics like defense and attack power. They receive experience points after slaying an enemy or casting a spell, and extra points at the end of the battle. Their skills increase after surpassing 100 points.

The map screen shows the party and groups of enemies traveling through the landscape in turns. The menu has options for moving the group or camping. In the encampment, one of the characters around the fire pit saves the game, while another inside the tent provides system options to change the interface color, adjust sound volume and rename the party members.

In some locations like temples, villages and towns, the party has to explore the place and talk to the citizens to move on to the next section. In later battles, the player has to make a moral choice about attacking mutated humans. At the end of each battle, the party is assigned a dark or light emblem, and certain party members choose to leave or stay in the group based on its alignment.</desc>

The game features multiple modes. The main story mode involves Mizoguchi chasing down a mysterious masked character after he disparages Osaka's takoyaki, of which Mizoguchi is fiercely protective. Mizoguchi then travels around Japan in pursuit, fighting the other characters for various contrived reasons. There's also a CPU Battle mode in which the player progresses through a more traditional "Arcade" mode with any character they wish. There's also the standard Versus mode for up to two players.

In addition, the game has a Survival Mode (survive as long as possible against an endless string of opponents), a Tag Mode (either combatant can hover around the edge of the screen to switch to a second character) and a Practice mode.</desc>

		<desc>This is the fourth entry in the  Final Fantasy series. It was known as Final Fantasy II internationally, because the  second and third games were never released outside of Japan.

The military country of Baron is one of the strongest in the land, with a proud army and a majestic air force known as the Red Wings. But, while their armies are kind and loyal, the recent actions of the King are anything but. The young Captain of the Red Wings, Cecil, is ordered to steal a crystal from a village of innocent magicians, and when he questions the actions of his King, Cecil is immediately thrown out of the country and sent off to kill strange monsters. Little does he realize the price the King's actions will pay, and what the true secret of the crystals, and their powers, truly is...

This is the first Final Fantasy game that introduced the famous ATB (active-time battle) system: during the battles, you have a time indicator for each party member that tells you when this character is able to act. If it takes you too long to select a command for this character, the enemy will act without waiting for your turn. The game abandons the job system that was implemented in the  first and the  third game in favor of pre-set character classes (paladin, white mage, ninja, etc.) assigned to each party member.

The PlayStation version adds a new rendered intro and ending.</desc>

All seems well in the world, until the wind suddenly stops, the sea begin to grow stagnant, the heat of fire becomes scarce, and the earth begins to wither. King Tycoon, sensing a premonition of evil, hurries off to check on the Wind Crystal, only to witness it destroy itself.

Meanwhile, a young traveler named Butz is camping in a field when a giant meteor strikes the planet. When he heads out to examine the meteor, he is shocked to find a young girl named Lenna, who is the princess of Tycoon, and a old man named Galuf, who is on a critical mission. Later, joined by Faris, a pirate captain, the foursome must travel the land in search of the destructor of the Crystals, and save the planet at any cost!

Final Fantasy V featured many new gameplay options and tactics, including an improved Job/Ability system (like in Final Fantasy Tactics), the return of the ATB (Active Time Battle) turn system, and all of the classic FF gameplay you've come to know and love!

Final Fantasy V was released as a stand-alone game in Japan, and again in Final Fantasy Collection. Its U.S. debut was as part of Final Fantasy Anthology. It was also later ported to the Gameboy Advance, adding 4 new Jobs, a new 30-floor dungeon, a bestiary, a music player, the ability to quick save anywhere, a few extra pieces of equipment, and a newly update translation.</desc>

		<name>Final Fantasy VI</name>
		<desc>This is the sixth entry in the  Final Fantasy series. It was called Final Fantasy III because three of the five previous installments of the series were never released outside of Japan.

1,000 years ago, the War of the Magi occurred. People remember it as one of the most horrible tragedies in history. Since the War of the Magi, magic has been all but forgotten, technology began to grow, and people returned to seemingly normal lives. The only true worry people had was the Empire, whose leaders were looking to revive the great force once known as "magic".

But then...something happened that would change the course of history forever...

The Empire had heard word of the remains of a mystical being, known as an "Esper", being found in the mining town of Narshe. Quickly, three soldiers were dispatched to find this Esper and bring it to the Emperor. One of the soldiers, a young girl, triggers a power in the Esper that will begin one of the most dangerous series of events ever. And the only ones who can help her are a rag-tag band of rebels and heroes, whose very hearts and souls are the only ones that can save the world from the mad plans of the Empire.

The game maintains the ATB (active time battle) system of the two previous  Final Fantasy games, spicing classic turn-based combat engine with a real-time element. The customization system combines character-specific classes with free-flowing character development. By finding various Espers and equipping them on characters, you can improve their parameters in different ways and choose the magic spells you want to learn for each character.</desc>

		<name>From TV Animation Slam Dunk : SD Heat Up!!</name>
		<desc>Among the most famous Japanese comics of the 90s are definitely Slam Dunk. The manga tells of the running track that will make the young hoodlum Hanamichi Sakuragi who joined the basketball club in Shohoku high school just because initially interested in the sister of the captain Akagi but later this sport will conquer him so much that he becomes a real basketman.

The game is essentially an arcade sports title basketball basically. The main screen there will be little choice given the presence of only three modes: Story mode and classic friendly tournament. In the first we follow the events of the television series whose plot differs slightly from the original one: using Shohoku then we will qualify for the national championship. The second and third but I think there is a need for further explanation.

Executable field operations would also be different, you can also feint shots and blow up their opponents markers. Then successfully accumulating a sequence of 'affirmative action' row (steps succeeded, baskets made or avoided), will fill a horizontal bar at the top of the screen and, as he did a little 'in the playroom with the SNK Street Hoop, pressing simultaneously the three keys will not dorsal (except B), you can make a super nice shooting with supplemental animations depending on the player used.

		<name>Front Mission - Gun Hazard</name>
		<desc>The year is 2064, when the great solar power satellite, ATLAS is overshadowed by the invention of fusion power. The government alliance that had supported the building of ATLAS now find themselves facing economic crisis as the balance of power shifts. In this world of conflict and change, the Walking Panzer, or Wanzer, (a form of mecha) becomes the standard armored unit for wars and petty battles across the globe. For the small nation of Bergen, a coup d'etat is underway, staged by Colonel Ark. Seeking to establish complete control over the government and the NORAD units stationed there, Ark's first step involves the capture of President Orwen. Tipped off to the rebellion, Orwen seeks to flee from Bergen, looking for safe passage out of the seaport of Port Ertothal. A young Wanzer pilot, Albert Grabner, is assigned escort duty to the president by loyal elements of the army stationed there...

Gun Hazard is a side-scrolling version of the Front Mission series. Gameplay is more than a little similar to Cybernator or Metal Warriors. The player moves between different stages on an area map. Once inside a level, the player controls Albert and his wanzer as it moves left, right across the screen. The wanzer is able to jump, and attack with a primary and a special weapon. At any time during a level, Albert can eject from his heavily armed wanzer to explore. Although vulnerable when outside, Albert is able to reach areas the wanzer cannot, in addition to being a smaller target and being able to jetpack indefinitely.

Additionally, Albert can recruit other characters through the normal course of the story, some of whom can be designated to support roles. These support characters when set can provide a variety of different cover fire abilities for Albert during his missions. They too gain experience and levels. Different weapons and armor can be found or bought. Essential components include the Booster ability which allows the wanzer to hover and increase it's jumps, as well as the Dash ability which allows quick left-right movement by the wanzer. Money and experience are earned through the completion of level objectives as well as the kill count of enemy wanzers.</desc>

		<name>Front Mission</name>
		<desc>In the future, many military forces are dependent on huge mech robots, called Wanzers (Walking Panzers) for combat. At Huffman Island, located in the the pacific ocean, wanzers are deployed by both the USN (United States of the New Continent) and the OCU (Oceana Community Union), who dispute ownership over the island.  One night, the OCU forces stage a covert recon mission on a facility located in Larcus, a USN-held territory and weapons facility. Lead by a soldier named Roid, this mission was entirely unofficial and violated the peace treaty. During the mission, USN forces lead by Commander Driscoll appeared and ambushed the OCU soldiers. During the combat, Roid's fiance, Karen is killed and the USN facility is blown up; placing the blame on the OCU. This became known as the "Larcus Incident" and the OCU denied all knowledge of it's soldiers actions. Ultimately it would be a leading cause to the second Huffman War. 

One year later, the war is underway and Huffman island is under provisional control of the OCU, but with a weakened military unable to defend against USN attacks. The soldiers involved involved in the Larcus Incident have all been discharged and disgraced. Roid spends his time fighting as a gladiator in the Wanzer fighting arena before being approached by a mysterious man. Colonel Olson has found out about Roid's history and wants him to command a mercenary unit he is assembling on behalf of the OCU, dubbed "Carrion Crow". Convincing Roid that Driscoll is still out there on the island, Roid agrees.

Front Mission is a turn-based strategy RPG played from an isometric perspective. Players progress in the story through large strategic battles involving multiple units and cutscenes between them. At certain places, usually towns, the player can visit multiple locations including bars and shops, and talk to people. Shops are also found to purchase new weaponry, parts and make repairs. In combat, each Wanzer robot is a seperate unit and, has a large variety of weapons and attack styles depending on what's equipped. Units get experience for defeating enemies and also for using various techniques. The more an attack is used, the more powerful it becomes.</desc>

Many adventurers have tried to find their way to the mysterious land of the Golden Condor, but how many of them have survived the impassable mountain paths, the dark forests and caves, and the vicious monsters? You are the wanderer Shiren, and the goal of your life is to find the Golden Land. Together with your best buddy Koppa, a talking weasel, you decide to venture deep into the dungeons that lead to the land, and to try your luck there.

Furai no Shiren (The Wanderer Shiren) is a roguelike, hack-and-slash game with randomly generated dungeon areas, items, and monsters. Despite being named Fushigi no Dungeon 2 it has no relation to the storyline or characters of the first game in the series, it does however share the same style of gameplay. The movement is turn-based. You visit towns and villages where you can buy and sell supplies. The dungeons are full of various traps and monsters, and sometimes non-playable characters you can talk to, some of which can join you on your quest.

		<name>F-Zero</name>
		<desc>F-Zero is a futuristic racing game, set in the year 2560. The player chooses one of the four available hovercars and then can race with other hovercars in one of the gameplay modes - "Practice" or "Grand Prix". 

In "Practice" mode, the player chooses one track where he competes with one other hovercar to win the race (or there can be no rival at all, if you so wish). In "Grand Prix", the player must complete a series of races with several competitors. Each race consists of five laps. 

The hovercar has a limited Power meter, which represents the machine's health and decreases when the hovercar collides with the track boundaries and other players. If power runs out, the hovercar explodes and the player loses the race. There are repair areas near the start line, which restore power to the player's hovercar if he drives into them. The tracks contain many more or less dangerous traps, such as icefields or landmines. 

Completing a lap awards the player a "Super Jet" which can be activated at any time to give a short speed boost. The hovercar can keep up to three Super Jets and use them when necessary. 

Completing a lap also gives points, which give the player a life when enough are accumulated. The player can lose a life in the Grand Prix mode if his hovercar explodes, if his hovercar somehow falls out of the track or if he ends up too far behind the other racers.</desc>

When two units meet in combat, a cutaway cutscene shows the aggressor landing (or missing) a hit, and the unit statistics underneath tell the player how much damage was caused.

		<name>Galaxy Wars</name>
		<desc>Home version of the 1979 arcade game of the same name. The aim is to launch missiles from the bottom of the screen at enemy spacecraft located at the top. To get there, the missile must pass through a asteroid belt flying across the screen and avoid the shots being fired down from the spacecraft. It is the players job to control the missile. Once launched it can be moved left and right and can be sped up by using the boost to speed it's way out of trouble. Points scored depend on the location of the hit on the enemy spacecraft. The speed at which enemy spacecraft move increases as the number of them decreases. Once all spacecraft have been destroyed, another wave starts, the speed decreases again and the process repeats. A life is lost when a missile is hit by a shot or collides with an asteroid.

Three game modes are available, B&amp;W and Color recreate the graphics and behaviour of the original arcade game in black &amp; white and color respectively whilst Neo mode updates the game with improved graphics and slightly different behaviour. There's also a turn-based two player mode. Other options include changing the number of lives available at the start of a game and the number of points needed for an extra ship.</desc>

		<name>Game no Tetsujin : The Shanghai</name>
		<desc>Game no Tetsujin: The Shanghai ("Iron Man Game: The Shanghai") is a puzzle/board game for the Super Famicom and is based on Shanghai, or mahjong solitaire. It was released on the Super Famicom exclusively in Japan.

The game features three different modes:

    Classic "Shanghai" Mahjong Solitaire, where the player can remove any two tiles as long as they match and both have a free horizontal side and aren't trapped with a piece on top.
    "Chinhai" or "Sichuan" Mahjong Solitaire, where the player can only remove paired tiles if they can be connected with an invisible line that bends at a 90 degree angle two times or fewer. This mode features stacked tiles, unusual for games with this variant, but has the benefit of instantly removing any paired tiles that are touching.
    A unique block-pushing mode where the player has an avatar and must make their way to the exit of the board by pushing certain mahjong tiles. When a mahjong tile connects to another like it, both tiles vanish. If it connects to a different tile, it'll change to that tile. Some tiles cannot be pushed, and if a pushable tile connects to one, it too will be immovable and the player may end up trapped. They do not have to remove all the tiles on the board - the only goal is to reach the end.

The game's story mode alternates through these three modes, and the player can also play any of the three modes directly from the main menu.</desc>

		<desc>Third title in the Ganbare Goemon series of platform/adventure games which cast you as the heroic Goemon as he attempts to save feudal Japan from all sorts of wacky evildoers. This time around, a time-travelling machine threatens all of Japan and thus Goemon and co. must jump into the future to stop the machine.

The game alternates between a top-down world map view in which your characters explore the gameworld and side-scrolling stages in which the main action lies. As in most games of the series there are also loads of mini-games and unique gameplay sequences such as maneuvering Goemon's giant mecha.

The game continues the tradition of bizarre humor unique to the series, you can play as either Goemon or any of his 3 companions, Ebisumaru, Sasuke or Yae with each sporting unique weapons and abilities and also with their own dialogue options and cutscenes, which feature sitcom-like pre-recorded laughs for added wackiness.

		<name>Ganbare Goemon Kirakira Douchuu : Boku ga Dancer ni Natta Wake</name>
		<desc>Fourth title in the Ganbare Goemon series of platform/adventure games which cast you as the heroic Goemon and his gang of wacky adventurers as he fights evil all over Japan. This sequel however, takes the action to outer space as the gang attempts to rescue Goemon Impact (Goemon's giant mecha) from a strange planet.

The game is based around a stage-select hub from which you select which character you want to play as and then attempt to clear the game's many side scrolling stages in standard action platformer fashion, navigating the obstacles and defeating all enemies you run into with your weapons. Since each one of Goemon's allies got stranded on a different planet, you must take control of each one of them in order to clear the stages and recover the special ability unique to each character that must be later put to use to release Goemon Impact. As in other games of the series there are also loads of mini-games and unique gameplay sequences triggered in boss fights, bonus stages and special situations. These involve shooter sequences, racing &amp; sport games and other assorted diversions.</desc>

In Ganbare Daiku no Gensan, you must go through five stages (with two areas each), destroying workers that get in your way using your mallet. You can use it to perform two special attacks. One that sends fireballs going in all directions, and a more powerful one that sends shockwaves, destroying everything on screen. At the end of each area, a boss needs to be defeated in order to proceed to the next one.</desc>

Magifact is credited on the title screen as the publisher of the game, but the credits makes it clear that the programming and design were handled by the obscure group Team Mental Care.

		<desc>GeGeGe no Kitarou: Fukkatsu! Tenma Daiou ("GeGeGe no Kitarou: Revival! Great King Tenma") is a side-scrolling action game based on the GeGeGe no Kitarou license. Kitarou, a youkai boy and the last surviving member of the Ghost Tribe, is tasked with defeating the cocoon form of the dormant Great King Tenma before he can revive and destroy the world of humans.


Each stage is set up as a series of boss fights against notable youkai from the franchise. The player must learn their tactics and defeat them while preserving as much of their health as possible, as they will often have to fight several bosses in a row without being able to heal. There's also the occasional action sequence, such as a vaguely shoot 'em up part that leads to a tough fight against a colossal enemy.


The game was featured on the 13th season of the popular gaming Japanese TV show GameCenter CX.</desc>

		<desc>One year ago they took from you your wife. Now it's time to pay them back, with interest.

Gekitotsu Dangan Jidousha Kessen: Battle Mobile plays similarly to Spyhunter in both perspective and objective, but your car in Battle Mobile isn't quite as high tech an instrument as that other game's vehicle. You can launch unlimited missiles, but they can only hit helicopters. For ground based targets you must dash into them to ram them off the road. Your car's health is constantly dwindling, even when you're not being attacked by enemies, so picking up the occasionally appearing energy refill items is essential. Shields can be picked up and stored that will make your car invulnerable to all damage for a short while.</desc>

		<name>Genocide 2</name>
		<desc>The world is still recovering from war. The mega-corporation CONEX has been spearheading the rebuilding process, but their true intentions are far from altruistic. By gobbling up their competition, and with the help of new weapons technology, CONEX is on the cusp of controlling the world. Only a hero from the last war can defy them and stop their plans of conquest.

Genocide 2 is a modified version of the PC release. The player takes control of a ten meter tall robotic ninja: the Tracer. Its only form of attack is a sword, but it can hold several extra weapons, and always has access to the Betty. The Betty can be fired in eight directions, returns to the Tracer after being fired, and can block enemy bullets. The objective of each stage is to reach the end, and some stages require you to destroy targets along the way. Any items picked up by the player, or damage done to the Tracer, carries over between stages, and each stage records your fastest time for beating them.

Aside from the visual downgrade, Genocide 2 also lost many minor enemy types and one mid-boss in the transition to the Super Famicom. The first stage was removed, and the first two levels of stage 2 were reversed. The Betty now can only be used for a limited time, and must recharge when its time has run out.</desc>

		<desc>Ghost Chaser Densei doesn't take any dramatic departures from the standard scrolling-brawler plot-line. A city twenty minutes in the future must be saved from a terrorist organization, and between salvation and you is a long, straight line full of goons who must be punched. Aside from receiving orders from your boss before each level, and the quick conversation with a boss or rare NPC, the story won't attempt to get in the way of beat-downs.

There are three playable characters in Ghost Chaser Densei: the martial artist Makai, the mace wielding cat-girl Iyo, and the autonomous robot Belva. Each has unique moves as well as the basic abilities of attacking, jumping, blocking, throwing, and using a special if attack and jump are pressed together. Unlike most brawlers these special moves deplete a recharging special bar, not your health. Makai can throw fireballs and do a flying kick in midair, Iyo can triangle jump and preform a spinning piledriver, and Belva can double jump and preform a grapple special. Characters also have a team up special if playing in two player mode. Enemies range from armored soldiers to lizard men to robots, but most break down into the same hierarchy: weaker types will rush at you while stronger types will shoot projectiles then rush at you. Each level ends with a unique boss with multiple short and long range attacks.</desc>

		<desc>Go Go Ackman 2 is mostly the same as its predecessor, with a few small tweaks. The angel Tenshi is still determined to end Ackman's nefarious ways, and this time he has enlisted the help of the angelic rock band Metal Angel. Ackman still murders at whim and has his companion Godon collect the souls of his slain, but this time Ackman can keep the weapons he finds, either sword, boomerang, or gun. Each weapon can be upgraded twice, but upgrades will be lost if Ackman is hit or finds a new weapon. Ackman can also now throw smaller enemies, although he can't move while holding them.

Who's really pulling the strings here? And, most importantly, does Ackman care about any of this at all?

The last of the Ackman games, Go Go Ackman 3 makes very few changes from Go Go Ackman 2, although Tenshi is now a playable character. Both Ackman and Tenshi can be switched between at special points in a level, but they share the same health meter and weapon. Unlike Ackman Tenshi can fly, but as he is an angel he can not collect the souls of enemies he kills. Souls have changed too, and are now used as currency in shops where Ackman can buy temporary powerups or healing. Finally Ackman has lost the ability to slide enemies along the ground, but he can now move while holding a stunned enemy.</desc>

Go Go Ackman is a scrolling platformer starring the titular Ackman. Ackman can punch and charge up a ranged wave of energy, and he can also jump on some enemies to stun them before running into them and turning them into a sliding projectile. Ackman can hold up to three bombs that can clear the screen of enemies, and can also hold a weapon, either a sword, boomerang, or pistol, but it will be lost if Ackman is hit. Levels are linear, but do allow some exploration to find weapons and items hidden off the beaten road.</desc>

		<name>Gokujou Parodius</name>
		<desc>Konami's Gradius and space-shooter parody series continues with this second installment.  Gameplay is similar to the Gradius series in that you control a ship that can move anywhere on the screen while the screen itself scrolls from left to right. Enemies appear in waves and destroying all the fighters in a single wave releases power-ups which may be used to choose your ships upgrade. The Upgrade bar too is lifted from Gradius, however each character has different names and functions for their upgrades.

In Gokujyou Parodius, you are now able to now choose from 11 different characters... many of whom appear from other Konami games. They include:

1. Vic Viper: a ship from Gradius

2. Takosuke: the "octopus" of the previous Parodius game, and also seen in at least one Goemon

3. Twinbee: making his appearance from the Twinbee side scrolling games, Twinbee is a squat round robot with a jetpack and a disproportionately big punching glove

4. Pentaro: the original "joke character", Pentaro made an appearence in a previous Gradius title as a flying penguin. However he does star in his own games as well, Konami's Penguin Adventure

5. Hikaru: Hikaru is a girl in a tight fighting "bunny suit" who is riding on top of a missile

6. Mambo: Mambo is a strange looking fish with two horns on the top of his head and on his underside

7. Michael: some kind of fat angel pig. He has wings and a golden halo over his head

8. Koitsu: A blue stick man riding on a surfboard. He's probably one of the more 'normal' characters

9. Goemon: star of the Goemon series of games. Goemon is a ninja warrior equipped with wooden pipes. He flies around in a superman pose for his appearance in Parodius

10. Dracula: star of Konami's Kid Dracula, this white haired squat character retains his vampiric abilities including that of being able to change into a bat

11. Upa: a flying baby. Upa is actually from a Konami game by the name of  Bokutte Upa but is probably just more recognizable as "the flying baby" of this crazy shooter

In addition to your player-character, the levels themselves will be full of a strange mix of Konami references, bright colors and the just plain zany. it's not uncommon to have to fly your ship underneath a woman's legs for example or chased by a giant walrus or having enemies shooting cute pink hearts at you.</desc>

		<name>GT Racing</name>
		<desc>GT Racing is a Super Famicom racing video game where the player gets to drive a Gran Turismo car in either championship or practice mode.  The game is based on the 1996 Super GT racing season using the horsepower standards and rules of the era.  

During championship mode, the player is asked enter a number, his or her driver's name, and the team name that he or she will use during the championship. The driver's name and team can be entered using either English or Japanese letters. When a player beats a record, he or she is asked to insert his or her number, name or initials (up to four characters and two digits for the number). Championship mode can last for multiple seasons. Playing ninety-nine seasons in a single racing career is theoretically possible due to the double-digit nature of the season information. There are eight different tracks, including the Suzuka Circuit that has been shown in video games since Pole Position II and Fuji Speedway (complete with a virtually photorealistic Mount Fuji in the background).

Versus mode is for two human players only and the record options allows the players to look at his or her previous records. In a race, there are up to fifteen opponents to race against. The player gets rewarded with an opportunity to upgrade his or her equipment after a top five finish on any race course. Bonus equipment includes a faster engine, better tires, and a special dose of nitrous oxide created specifically for Gran Turismo vehicles. All of the bonus automobile parts are automatically installed in the appropriate parts for supercharging the vehicle. Once all the special parts are earned, the automobile is considered to be fully upgraded. The ultimate goal is to win the Gran Turismo championship for his or her team in addition for him/herself.

The "free practice" is essentially a time trial mode where the player races by him/herself for up to ten laps. Acquiring damage is still possible either crashing into walls or through normal wear and tear. The fastest lap time gets captured for the record book just like in the other modes of the game. Before being able to practice freely, the player can also choose the weather condition and the setup of his vehicle</desc>

		<name>Hakunetsu Pro Yakyuu '93 : Ganba League</name>
		<desc>Hakunetsu Pro Yakyuu Ganba League '93 is the sequel to Hakunetsu Pro Yakyuu Ganba League, otherwise known as Extra Innings. As with the original, Ganba League '93 has a cartoony presentation and emphasizes arcade-style fast gameplay over more serious sim elements. All the included teams are fictional and the player can even edit their own teams. The player can choose between playing a one-off game or entering a pennant race, as well as selecting one or two human players or letting the CPU play against itself with the Watch mode.

The game is the second in this series, with a third game Hakunetsu Pro Yakyuu '94 Ganba League 3 released the following year. Only the first game in the series, Extra Innings, ever left Japan.</desc>

		<name>Hameln no Violin Hiki</name>
		<desc>In Violinist of Hameln you play the role of Hamel, a sort of wanderer / adventurer whose weapon is a violin. His music can cover enemies in fear, or even control their minds. Hamel and his mascot Oboe arrives at Staccato, a small town attacked by monsters, and drives them away with his power. Impressed, a cute little girl named Flute decides to go with Hamel in order to find and destroy the evil power behind the attacks.

The game is typical platform. You play as Hamel, and with your violin can shoot musical notes to beat your enemies. However, you count with Flutes aid. Flute follows you (although you can order her to stop and stay), but also can be grabbed and thrown at the enemies (yes, thrown at the enemies). Flute can also collect through all the stages some costumes that, when worn, give her special abilities, such as flying, leaping, breaking walls or even explode and kill all in screen. At the end of each stage, of course, youll find the typical boss, all named as musical instruments.

		<name>Hashire Hebereke</name>
		<desc>Hashire Hebereke ("Run Hebereke") is an isometric racing game from SunSoft that features Hebereke, Sukezaemon, O-Chan and the rest of Hebereke's friends. The player must race across a course hitting three checkpoints before returning to the starting line to move onto the next lap. The courses all have different layouts and the player must use the D-pad to turn their character mid-sprint, often causing them to veer strongly from one side to the other. In the single-player the player, as Hebereke, has to challenge every other character on their respective courses. Characters have distinctive strengths and weaknesses that the player needs to ascertain in order to defeat them.

Players can also acquire items that can help them out by running over certain spots on the course, similar to Super Mario Kart, and can collect multiple items and switch between them. The game also includes a tag mode and bonus rounds that involve getting chased in a circle by a giant boulder.</desc>

		<name>Hat Trick Hero 2</name>
		<desc>Hat Trick Hero 2 is the follow up to Hat Trick Hero, and it is loosely based on the arcade game Hat Trick Hero '93. One or two players can play in a exhibition game (one single match) or in a world league. The game scrolls horizontally uses mode 7 graphics to give the playing field some perspective.

There are 18 countries to select from, each with different running, kicking and technical abilities. You can use 5 different formations, which are 4-4-2, 4-3-3, 3-5-2, WM and libero. You also select a team captain from 8 different characters.

You can perform a foul tackle on the opponent, but when the referee is close enough to notice it you risk getting a yellow or red card. By holding down a direction after shooting the players can shoot the ball with curve effect. During the game a power-up bar is charged which can be used for special abilities. Holding down R allows you to run faster, but this slowly drains the power-up bar. With a fully charged power-up bar you can perform an unstoppable hyper shoot by pressing a special combination, and this drains the power-up bar entirely.</desc>

One day, the sky suddenly turns dark blue, a heavy rain falls onto the city, and the boy finds, halfway between his house and the school, an umbrella which seems to have fallen from the sky. What he does not know is that the umbrella is magical! The moment he touches it, he is transfered to a parallel universe. Immediately, he is attacked by a huge tank, but a strange old man with a talking bird saves him. It seems that an evil creature named Dondera is threatening the country with the terrible monsters she created. But is it really so? You visit the capital town, talk to the emperor, and decide to investigate the matter...

"Holy Umbrella" is essentially a platform action game, but unlike most other games of this genre, it allows you to visit towns, where you control your hero in a standard RPG-like top-down fashion. You can enter houses, talk to townspeople, etc. On platform levels, which are the main part of the game, you have to switch between the hero, the talking bird Bonto who accompanies you on your quest, and the girl Saki, whom you meet later in the game. Every character has his/her own special abilities and own ways of fighting: the hero can slide through air by using the umbrella, Bonto can double-jump on high ledges, Saki can jump on walls, etc. You use your umbrella as a weapon, as well as elemental stones you can collect on your way and throw at enemies. You also find various power-ups and items you can equip on the hero.</desc>

		<name>Iron Commando : Koutetsu no Senshi</name>
		<desc>Iron commando is a brawler beat-em-up like Final Fight or Streets of Rage with lots of weapons and big end bosses.

The B-movie story is cheesy and does nothing more than accommodate for the action. From the introduction sequence: "The peril came from outer space. A meteorite entered the earth's atmosphere bringing chaos. After observation, the scientists found that the meteorite was radioactive and had to be destroyed. Unfortunately, terrorists from g.h.o.s.t. want the meteorite too. The Iron Commando's mission is to retrieve the deadly body and avoid genetic mutation."

The player or players walk along the levels beating up enemies. On some levels you ride a motorcycle or jeep, even a mine kart, and shoot your way through hordes of enemies. There are several end bosses, some are screen filling like a helicopter and a giant robot.

Some enemies will drop food, grenades or weapons as you beat them into a bloody pulp. There are lots of different Weapons: 9mm guns, shotguns, machine guns, knives, baseball bats. The weird thing is, enemies that use a sword and even dogs will occasionally drop a machine gun or baseball bat.

As with the other games in the series, the pitch is depicted horizontally with the camera focused on the ball in the center. It features an Exhibition mode, a League mode and a Tournament mode. It also includes two practice modes and a separate penalty shootout mode. Up to four players can play the game, taking on different combinations of control over the two teams: 1 vs. CPU, 1 vs. 1, 2 vs. CPU, 1 vs. 2 and 2 vs. 2. Publisher Epoch also incorporated some Barcode Battler compatibility, a common feature for their Super Famicom games produced in the mid-90s.

The game features every team in the 1995 season of J-League, which increased from 12 to 14 teams since the previous season.</desc>

It is the second game in the J-League Soccer Prime Goal series, preceded by J-League Soccer: Prime Goal and succeeded by 90 Minutes: European Prime Goal. Prime Goal 2 was released on August 5, 1994 only in Japan for the Super Famicom.

Other than running around, shooting, passing, and slide-tackling, the player has control over several other actions. Naturally, there are throw ins (the player can select which team member to throw the ball to), goal kicks (where the player controls the distance the ball is kicked), fouls (referees even dole out yellow and red cards), and occasionally a one-on-one minigame. In this one-on-one game the player can either manage to relinquish control of the ball from the opponent, or have the opponent jump over the player (depending on the player's button inputs).

Of note are the variety of modes that are offered in Prime Goal 2. Naturally, there is a player vs. computer and player vs. player mode, but also included are a campaign mode (complete with a password system), a penalty kick mode, and an "east vs. west" mode where the player is able to consolidate members from several teams into one, customized team.</desc>

The available modes are exhibition matches, tournament, league, cup and all-star (the teams are divided into two leagues and the overall winner is decided with play-offs). With the option "You're a Hero", the player can create a new athlete, change his stats with a few training lessons and swap it with an existing one. The player either controls the athlete who has the ball or, when in defense, the one who is nearest to it. The field is shown from a slightly angled side-perspective. During most modes, all teams can be taken over by human players, but only two can play at the same time.</desc>

This home version was never released outside of Japan. The game was also ported to the Amiga and Atari ST, where it is known simply as Big Run.GameplayIn addition to passing each checkpoint under the required time - the checkpoint system ubiquitous in solo racing games of the era - the player must also be aware of environmental dangers along the course and needs to select a sponsor, navigator and engineer team before starting. They must also balance the weight of their car, as too few replacement parts might cause a problem further into the race yet having too many will greatly reduce the car's top speed.</desc>

		<name>Jammes</name>
		<desc>Jammes is a puzzle game for the Super Famicom that is a variant of the "falling blocks" sub-genre popularized by games such as Tetris and Columns. It was exclusive to the Super Famicom.

The game features a story mode with increasingly difficult opponents - it also has a tutorial for its obtuse mechanics - as well as a free mode where the player tries to survive as long as possible and a versus mode for multiple human players. In the single-player modes, the player can choose between a male or female avatar.

The goal of the game is take a pair of falling dice, each with a specific color and number attached to them, and drop them into a grid with other fallen dice. If a die is on a line horizontally, vertically or diagonally with another die of the same color, both those dice and every die in-between will drop by one in value. Once a die has reached "1" and is involved in another combo, it disappears. Dice on top fall in the gaps left behind, potentially creating chain reactions. There are also power-ups that will either help the player out or create problems for the opponent. The game ends once the dice stack to the top of the screen.</desc>

Jerry moves by sliding across the ground and can latch on to walls and climb them. Jerry can also jump, stretch out to cling to ceilings, and also move at a faster pace. Jerry can consume balls that he finds during a stage and can then fire them out of his body at enemies blocking his path. Enemies can also be defeated by jumping on them and then flattening Jerry's body on them. Also, there are flowers that contain items for Jerry to collect. Items include life, which refills health, a 1-up that adds an extra life, and a seed, which will grow a climbable beanstalk when planted.

		<name>Jikkyou Oshaberi Parodius</name>
		<desc>The third in the Paroidus series, it's the same gameplay and zaniness that substantiated the first two games. Gameplay itself is a copy (a parody rather) of Konami's famous Gradius series in that the screen scrolls from left to right (most times) and you maneuver around the screen destroying waves of enemies and avoiding obstacles. Unlike previous Parodius titles, this game contains a difficulty adjustment option, allowing the player to make things easier... or harder. Also unique to this parodius title is a bit of japanese digital voice that shouts out various things at you while you play. Survival throughout the level earns you a boss fight, which frequently includes some of the strangest characters in the game. Make no mistake, this *is* Gradius,  but with all sorts of strange graphics, music and references to other Konami games... So in other words, it's Parodius!

There are now more power-ups than ever including the standard power-up (red, used to upgrade weapons), the shield power-up (blue) and a variety of different coloured bells. Green Bells will make you huge on the screen, Yellow Bells are worth points (points in turn are worth extra lives),  Blue Bells are "big bombs" that clear the screen of enemies/shots and can be saved until you need them, White Bells will give your character a megaphone that will shout out japanese phrases, the characters of the phrases themselves can be used to damage enemies (the power of words!), The Red Bell stockpiles you with three point-defense lasers... only one of which can be activated at a time and disappear after a short while. Finally the purple bell will clear the screen of all but the strongest enemies... and will turn them into power-ups.

This time around there are 16 different characters to chose from and the power-ups and weapons that they use are more unique than ever. Several familiar "faces" return and they've brought along friends to share in the party:
Vic Viper: The "gradius ship" appears once again in this gradius parody, equipped with it's traditional gradius weapons
2. Lord British: The "other" Gradius ship and arguably the more famous of the two. Lord British has weapons similar to Vic but quite different also.Missiles and shields work differently for instance. And Lord British uses a Ripple gun instead of a double shot.
3. Pentaro: It just wouldn't be a Parodius game if Pentaro wasn't involved. Originally from Konami's Penguin Adventure, Pentaro retains the same abilities from previous Parodius games... however his Potion weapon may now hit multiple enemies and his normal weapon shots explode against obstacles
4. Hanako: Also from Penguin Adventure, Hanako the penguin is Pentaro's girlfriend. While Pentaro is blue, she is the red penguin. She plays nearly identical to Pentaro with the exception of her S. Bomb weapon
5. Twinbee: Twinbee, from the Twinbee games is another returning Parodius star. Unfortunately he hasn't been upgraded since previous games, so his weapons are nearly identical; Punching Glove Rocket and all...
6. Winbee: Winbee, also from Twinbee is red and has moves identical to Twinbee, except for one difference... when she has 3 Options available, she can power them up to harm enemies that touch them.
7. Tako: Again, it just wouldn't be a parodius game without a flying octopus. And here he is, still wearing a baseball cap, but otherwise unchanged from previous Parodius games.
8. Belial: A yellow female octopus with a bow in her hair, she is identical to Tako with the exception of her Missile and Double weapons... which are instead identical to the Vic Viper.
9. Soitsu: A stickman (now green) surfing aboard a paper airplane, Soitsu plays similar to Koitsu from the previous game, aside from his colour. His laser weapon is able to charge up to deliver more power and he drops little stickmen onto the ground which occasionally dance around rather than attacking. Additionally he has an "upgrade power" (S. Power) that make all his other abilities stronger
10. Doitsu: Similar to Soitsu but with a Double Laser ability. He is an orange stickman riding on a paper airplane and no "upgrade" power, using normal options instead
11. Upa: Upa aka The Flying Baby is back from the previous Parodius game (as well as his original game, Bokutte Upa) and plays nearly the same. Instead of a shield, he has a Mega Crush power that damages all on-screen enemies... and also has an "Upgrade Power" in the form of Grade Up that makes his other abilities stronger.
12. Rupa: Another flying baby (presumably also from Bokutte Upa), Rupa plays similar tot Upa but with a Multi Spread gun which fires missiles in multiple directions (with each upgrade) and a S.Vulcan gun which automatically aims towards enemies.
13. Mike: A cute little kitten who happens to to have a very powerful wave weapon which can travel through obstacles and enemies. Additionally he has a multiple bomb ability which requires his "upgrade ability" (Grade Up) to get really powerful
14. Rani: Another cute kitten (this one rolled onto his bottom facing forward) with very power weaponry. Some of the highlights include a Reflect weapon wherein the shots bounce off of obstacles. Another is the S laser which travels forward but then homes in Up or Down to hit the enemy. And finally, Rani's missile weapon is two homing bells. Rani also has an "upgrade ability" in the form of Grade Up, however it only upgrades the Reflect Shot.
15. Memim: One of the fairy characters, Memim is a female flying girl with standard female bikini clothing. She carries some unique missile weapons however, whose direction is determined by Memim's current location on the screen when fired.
16. Sue: The other fairy with tight clothing, Sue is unique in that her weapons are upgraded/displayed in a different order from everybody else's in the game. For instance her Option is the 4th weapon on the list rather than the 6th... requiring less power-ups to activate it. However aside from that... all of her weapons are the exact same as the Vic Viper's.</desc>

		<name>Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu : Basic Ban '98</name>
		<desc>Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu '98: Basic Edition is a game of Baseball, where we take the role of the nice "pawapurokun", the little tubby baseball players found in all games of the series. The gameplay is classic but dreadfully accurate. In attack it is necessary to place and have a god like timing to get a good stroke of the bat. A rectangle is displayed in front of the batter delimiting the area in which the pitcher can place the ball without being at fault, and a small square, such as a viewfinder, shows the place where we will hit. At the top of the screen, a "mirror" view shows our batters face and behind him, the receiver of the opposing team. It is necessary to observe his glove to get an idea of where the pitcher will throw. In defense we will run, dive and quickly rethrow the ball in order to eliminate the opponents who managed to hit the ball. The game modes offer a classic championship with all the real professional teams of Japanese leagues and a scenario mode where we take a match in progress in a given situation. There is also an essential training mode to improve.</desc>

		<desc>ikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu 2 ("Play-by-play Powerful Pro Baseball 2") is a baseball game for the Super Famicom and the second in Konami's Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu series, usually shortened to "Power Pro".

The player once again takes to the field with numerous real-life Japanese baseball teams albeit with spherical-domed super-deformed players. It comes with all the modes of the original, including training in any role on the field as well as the standard one-player exhibition, two-player exhibition, pennant mode and a "watch mode" where the player observes two CPU teams.

True to its name, the game's events are called play-by-play by an off-screen announcer: this particular game features voice clips from sports commentator Motoharu Ota from the Kansai-region TV/radio broadcasters Asahi Broadcasting Corporation.</desc>

It iterates on the third game with a roster update for Spring of 1997, but is otherwise identical to Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu 3. '97-Haru was released after the true sequel Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu 4, which was an N64 exclusive that came out just a week earlier.

The game features a lot of voicework - hence the Jikkyou, or "Live Commentary" - and represents its characters as large-headed cartoon characters. These are series staples, and persist to the modern entries.</desc>

		<name>Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu 3</name>
		<desc>Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu 3 is the third major game in the Powerful Pro series. This game was released on February 29, 1996 for the Super Famicom only in Japan by Konami. The game was developed by Diamond Head, a developer behind many Jikkyou Powerful Pro games. Powerful Pro 3 is a traditional baseball simulator, in the "super deformed" or "chibi" style that makes the franchise well-known.

The game is fairly similar to its predecessors, Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu '94 and Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu 2, although it does add some new features, such as Success Mode. Success Mode is an RPG-esque mode where players develop a baseball player, guiding them through situations and forming them into a "powerful pro."

The real draw of the Powerful Pro series is the Success Mode, which was started with this game. It puts the player in control of a pre-made character who the player must develop into a powerful athlete. This is done by guiding the player through situations, making decisions, etc. As a more "role-playing game"-esque part of the game, this actually provides players with multiple save slots and options.</desc>

It is the first of six Super Famicom games in the franchise. The game is reminiscent of Namco's Famista series, especially with the cartoonish super-deformed athletes. As well as the usual exhibition and pennant modes, the player can practice any position in the game (batting, pitching, fielding) with any team member.

As with most games in the Power Pro series, Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu '94 was never released outside of Japan.</desc>

It fits between the core entries Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu 3 and Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu 4, which were released in the first quarters of 1996 and 1997 respectively, and largely based on the former's engine. Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu 3 '97-Haru, also released in March of 1997, was another interstitial game that used the same engine as JPPY 3.

The game features updated rosters and details for the 1996 season of the Nippon Professional Baseball league. It carries over the large number of customizable game modes from the third game.</desc>

In this game, you navigate Jojo in an adventure-like fashion, viewing the hero from third-person perspective.

Jojo and his party members possess the so-called "stands", super-powerful creatures you summon during fights. before each fight, you'll have to choose one of fice available tarot cards to determine the amount of luck and compatibility of the stands you'll have in the game.</desc>

		<desc>In a future where fossil fuels are limited, major countries and forces of the world are at war with one another over territory. Alliances are made, forming two major sides: The Axis and The Federation.  The elite units in these wars are Assault Suits, man-piloted combat mechs called Assault Suits.  Jake is one such pilot, drafted into the Pacific States' Marine Corp under the Federation. During his training, the war has grown substantially and upon being assigned to a platoon, he is immediately thrown into combat.

Cybernator is a side scrolling mech combat game and platform game. The player controls Jake as he moves his assault suit left and right on the battlefield. The assault suit can jump and use a jetpack for a short time to increase altitude. The assault suit begins with a Shot machine gun weapon that spreads out fire in front, and a Punch weapon for close melee. Additional weapons can be found during the course of the game and existing weapons improved by the gathering of "P" power-ups, left by defeated enemy. Each level contains a variety of enemies and an end boss which must be destroyed to reach the next level. Some levels take place as horizontally scrolling shooters, in which the Assault suit can move up, down, left and right on the screen... but is constantly advancing towards new threats.</desc>

		<desc>Kikou Keisatsu Metal Jack is a scrolling brawler based on the anime of the same name. At the start of the game the player can choose from Red Jack, Silver Jack, or Blue Jack. Red and Silver both have weapons they can find ammo for in levels (a gun and baton, respectively), and all three can do a multiple hit combo or a jumping attack. At the end of a level the Jack will be met by his vehicle which will then merge with his armor. In this form the Jack's attacks are strengthened and he can charge up an attack that hits every enemy onscreen.

There is no story told at any point in the game, so if you want to know what's going on you'll have to track down the anime.</desc>

		<name>Kingyo Chuuihou! : Tobidase! Game Gakuen</name>
		<desc>Kingyo Chuuihou! Tobidase! Game Gakuen ("Goldfish Warning! Leap Out! Game Academy!") is a multiplayer party game based on the Kingyo Chuuihou! (Goldfish Warning!) manga and anime. The anime is about a rich girl named Chitose who loses her fortune and is forced to enroll in a public rural school that accepts barnyard animals as students. The anime charts her attempts to refine/gentrify those around her, including her new best friend Wapiko (the pink-haired girl on the cover/title screen).

The game allows for up to three players. Each "mini-game" is selected from a roulette, and players compete to earn 100 points the quickest. These mini-games can range from trivia contests to more action-oriented fare. Most mini-games have their own rules concerning gaining (and losing) points to pay attention to.

Kingyo Chuuihou! Tobidase! Game Gakuen was released on the Super Famicom in 1994 and was never released outside of Japan. It is the only Kingyo Chuuihou game on the Super Famicom: the other two were created for the Nintendo Game Boy prior to this game.</desc>

		<name>Kirby no Kirakira Kids</name>
		<desc>A Tetris-like puzzle game. There are varying modes of play, such as Time Trial, Challenge and Story Mode, but the basic idea of play is the same: you must sandwich Star Blocks between two like Friend Blocks, either horizontally or vertically. The Friend Blocks and any Star Blocks in-between are then removed from play. Similar to Tetris, sets of blocks fall into the bin that contain any two of the following types:

Star Blocks: The most important block, as all of the game types rely on it. Sandwich these blocks between two Friend Blocks either horizontally or vertically, and they will be cleared. The more stars you clear, the higher the score.

Friend Blocks: These blocks have pictures of Kirby's friends - Rick the Hamster, Kine the Fish, and Coo the Owl (all from Kirby's Dream Land 2) - on them. Match two of each to clear them from the screen. Any Star Blocks between the two character blocks will also be cleared.

Bomb Blocks: Sandwich a Bomb Block in between two Friend Blocks, and the bomb will explode, removing all blocks in the same row.

Hard Blocks: You have to clear these blocks twice to clear them from the screen. Clear them once and they transform into an ordinary Star Block, and then can be removed in the normal way.

The game also features a 'chain' system that rewards you for clearing blocks which then clear other blocks. If you clear two or more blocks in this manner, then you'll be rewarded with Kirby raining down that amount of Stars, which can fill in gaps, which in turn could complete a row and allow it to chain even further.</desc>

		<name>Kishin Douji Zenki : Battle Raiden</name>
		<desc>Once already Chiaki and her reluctant demon servant Zenki have saved the world from the forces of darkness, but apparently once is never enough. Chiaki has a vision of five cloaked figures and knows that only she and Zenki can stop them. At once they set off to track down the demon leaders.

In Kishin Douji ZENKI: Battle Raiden the player takes the role of Zenki. At first, and occasionally through the game, Zenki will be in his powered down form where he can only punch, jump, and dash. After Chiaki recovers her bracelet, or regains her concentration, or whatever she needs to do at the time, she can transform Zenki into his powered up form. In this form Zenki deals more damage and has a much longer list of attacks that get added to as the game progresses, such as a pillar of energy, an electrified punch, and a dashing attack. By picking up scrolls Zenki can do a powerful Rudora attack to all enemies on screen, but this attack damages Zenki as well.

To complete platforming levels Zenki will have to make it to the end of the level while occasionally finding hidden stone monuments that, when destroyed, will drop items as well as alter the level or remove obstacles, allowing Zenki to pass. After a stage's first platforming level is a midboss fight, and after the second platforming level is the boss fight proper.</desc>

		<desc>Kishin Douji Zenki: Denei Raibu ("Demon Child Zenki: Thunder Dance Movie", roughly) is an action/platformer game from Now Production and Hudson Soft. It is the second of three games based on the license to be released for the Super Famicom.nnnnIt features characters and plot details from Kishin Douji Zenki, usually just known as Zenki, supernatural manga and anime about a powerful but benevolent demon guardian named Zenki and his human companion, the shrine maiden Chiaki. Centuries previously, Chiaki's ancestor used Zenki to defeat the evil goddess Kurama - the manga/anime begins with Kurama's return and Chiaki accidentally releasing Zenki.nnnnThe game is unusual as it splits its time between two modes that are distinct both tonally and mechanically. The "mature" Zenki, in his most powerful form, fights various demon minions of Kurama in tactical one-on-one battles that use a real-time progress bar that needs to be filled at least partially before an attack can be launched. This mode is similar to the gameplay used in other anime license action games, such as YuYu Hakusho and YuYu Hakusho Tokubetsu Hen. The other mode is a more cartoonish platformer featuring Chiaki as she attempts to assist Zenki by completing various objectives. Chiaki resorts to her magic to protect herself.</desc>

The game follows Chiaki Enno, a descendant of the master priest who sealed away the evil Goddess Karuma, and Zenki, the spirit guardian Chiaki's ancestor allied with, in a quest to once again defeat Karuma now that she has resurfaced.nnnnThe game was the third Kishin Douji Zenki game to be released for the Super Famicom and the fifth overall. It would also be the last.nnnnThe game employees an unusual structure which combines elements of board games, puzzle games and strategy games. Chiaki and Zenki move a certain number of spaces across a board determined by a dice roll. The player can also spend movement points on moving the tiles around the world, which is often necessary to create a route to the exit.nnnnIf the player bumps into one of Karuma's eyeball minions, the game switches to a battle in which Zenki and his opponent draw cards and attack based on the icon on the card: these might involve fireballs, martial arts or spirit beams.nnnnIt is possible to use special abilities to wipe enemies off the board, preventing the necessity of fighting them and minimizing the chance of Zenki falling in combat before the player can win the board. More special abilities become unlocked as the player progresses.</desc>

		<desc>This game is based on the animé series Villgust. The main hero of the game is Shun, a teenager who lives in modern-day Japan. One day, when he was going back from school with his girlfriend Michiko, Shun noticed a strange red-eyed rabbit. When he tried to follow him, Shun suddenly found himself all alone in a forest clearing. He was immediately approached by a group of four adventurers who said they were members of a group called R.A.G.E. (Resistance Against God of Evil). Apparently, Shun was transported into a parallel medieval world, and an evil organization known as Vile was the one behind Michiko's kidnapping. Shun and his friends will now do anything to help Michiko and to destroy Vile!

This is a traditional console-style RPG. You travel on the world map, visit towns, buy equipment and items, descend into dungeons, and fight random enemies in turn-based combat viewed from a third-person "over-the-shoulder" perspective. The party can hold up to five characters. The characters level up in a standard way, and also get experience and new levels for their magical spells.

A curse has fallen onto Andell - its four island, once united, are now separated, and are floating away from the heart of the continent, the temple of Andell. The sages of the temple summon a great hero named Farse, who must find a special magic orb for each one of the islands, which is the only way to re-unite them.

		<desc>Libble Rabble (?????? Riburu Raburu) is an arcade game that was originally released by Namco in October 1983. It was designed by Toru Iwatani, who had also designed the Gee Bee series, Pac-Man, and Pole Position. It is a curious but challenging game, where the player tries to harvest little mushrooms (Mushlins) while avoiding various enemies. It was ported to the Super Famicom in 1994.
At first glance, the gameplay resembles Taito's Qix. The player controls two "arrows", one red (Libble) and one blue (Rabble) with a line strung between them. The object is to wrap the line around poles and surround Mushlins and enemies with it. The player can either close the loops themselves (worth more points for the Mushlins) or move both arrows to the same edge of the screen. The player clears a "season" when he or she harvests all the Mushlins.</desc>

		<desc>May is an apprentice mage at Magic School and must pass the final exam.

A puzzle game seen from a top-down perspective. The goal of each level is to open the exit by pushing a magic stone on a designated spot. May can also push objects one tile ahead without moving herself. This is often used to get the stone over water that she can't cross herself. May's other ability is to create magic bubbles. She can create bubbles in three different sizes. Bubbles will pop after a certain amount of time, depending on their size. If they pop while next to the stone or another bubble, the stone or bubble will be moved one space. Since May can create several bubbles simultaneously, it is possible, and often necessary, to create chain reactions to maneuver the stone into the desired position.

As the game progresses, levels become increasingly difficult and new hazards and enemies are introduced. Enemies follow a set movement pattern and can sometimes be stopped, but not destroyed by magic bubbles. Later levels are made more complicated by different types of tiles including: grass that slows down May, ice that May and the magic stone will slip over, spikes that destroy the stone if it is pushed into them, collapsing tiles that can only be walked over once, rune tiles on which May cannot create magic bubbles, teleporters and others.</desc>

The combat features many innovations compared to traditional console RPGs: your position on the battle field is important, and certain techniques can be used only from certain positions, and enemy attacks also affect only specific parts of the field. Out of the seven chapters, some have more battle-oriented gameplay, while others are more devoted to puzzle-solving and information-gathering.

The game is one of the least known Squaresoft products, and was never released outside of Japan.</desc>

There is also a battle mode that puts Justy versus Liberty to see who can fetch the most candy.

		<desc>The game is set in the same universe and shares characters and storyline with  Puyo Puyo puzzle games. Unlike Puyo Puyo, Mado Monogatari is a Japanese-style RPG. You play Arle, a five-year old apprentice magician. She is attending a special kindergarten, and it is time for the Final Exam. At the same time, Arle receives a mysterious letter that tells her that if she finds eight magical gems and takes them to the Wizard Mountain, she'll be granted one wish. Arle decides to search for the gems which are scattered all over the world, and to overcome all the obstacles with her great magic power!

The game features random enemy encounters and turn-based combat, which takes place on a platform (Arle to the left, the enemies to the right). You can't perform physical attacks at all, and your only way of harming enemies is through magic. During the game, you learn a variety of magic spells, which can be upgraded later. In battles you can't see your own and the enemies' hit points, and have to act according to your intuition.

		<name>Mahou Poi Poi Poitto!</name>
		<desc>Mahou Poi Poi Poitto! ("Magic Poi Poi Poitto!") is a puzzle game developed by Metro and published by TAKARA for the Arcade and SNES. It plays similarly to other match-3 games of the era, like Columns, in that the player has to line up three identical pieces horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Pieces fall in square clumps of four, sometimes including cloud pieces which immediately vanish, and very rarely including a sun icon that can remove all the icons of a single type.

The game features a competitive two-player mode and a one-player story mode. In the story mode, the player takes on a series of monsters. The monster intermittently casts spells at the player that randomly transforms blocks into "enemy blocks". By casting magic back at the monster, best done by creating chains and combos, the ground beneath them moves towards the ceiling. Once high enough, the monster is crushed and the player moves onto the next stage.</desc>

		<name>Mario no Super Picross</name>
		<desc>A sequel to Mario's Picross on the GameBoy, Mario's Super Picross features the same gameplay as its predecessor. The game is played slab of stone with a grid on it. Above of every column and next to every row are numbers that acts as clues as to where a filled square is located along that column or row. The point of the game is to find all the filled squares on the grid by using your hammer and chiseling out squares that you think are filled and marking those that aren't with X.

There are two different sets of puzzles available but you start off with only one, Mario's Picross, and when you completed the first level, Wario will pop in and offer you his set of puzzles. The difference between the two is that Mario's Picross have to be completed within a certain time. Every time you chisel out the wrong square, it will deduct time. If time runs out before you can solve the puzzle, it's game over. Wario's Picross are timed to see how long it will take you to complete it, but will not run out. The catch here is that you will not be notified of a wrong square.

Other features includes game-saves, hints and tutorials.</desc>

"Whew, woosh!"

And suddenly, the bucket was a snug fit on Mario's head.

"Uwagh, I can't see in this thing!"

The sprite of the woods, Wanda, witnessed it. The petite pixie did not have the strength to remove the bucket on her own, but she desired to help somehow. Thus, Wanda sends Mario a signal with her magic wand, determined to reunite him with Luigi......</desc>

The Mazinger Z comes with a full armory of anti-robot weaponry, from super-powered karate moves to missiles, Breast Fire, and its signature Rocket Punch. Special moves deplete a regenerating energy meter, while Rocket Punches can be preformed at any time, although Mazinger will be unable to punch until its arms return. Each level contains several varieties of enemies, all of them from the show and unique to each level, that must be defeated to progress. Some enemy robots will fire projectiles from a distance while others will rush in attempt to grapple the Mazinger, and sometimes more than one enemy must be fought at once. Enemies will drop healing items and occasionally an item that upgrades Mazinger's Rocket Punch to the Iron Cutter for a limited time. At the end of each level is a fight with a stronger boss robot with more dangerous attacks.</desc>

		<name>Mickey to Donald : Magical Adventure 3</name>
		<desc>Mickey to Donald: Magical Adventure 3 (the former sub-title translated to "Mickey &amp; Donald") is a side-scrolling platformer developed and published by Capcom for the Super Famicom exclusively in Japan on December 8, 1995.nnnnThe sequel to The Great Circus Mystery Starring Mickey &amp; Minnie (and the third and final game in Disney's "Magical Quest" trilogy), Magical Adventure 3 follows Disney mascots Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck as they traverse through Storybook Land to rescue Donald's duckling nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie from the evil King Pete.nnnnAlong with a new fantasy setting, the game revamps both the two-player co-operative and magical costume mechanics by having each costume work differently for each playable character. In addition, players can use their costume's powers for the other player's benefit (for example, Mickey can stand on Donald's barrel armor to float above water).nnnnThe game was later ported to the Game Boy Advance and released in Japan on November 21, 2003. It later received a translated release in North America (on March 19, 2004) and Europe (on June 14, 2005) as Disney's Magical Quest 3 Starring Mickey &amp; Donald.</desc>

		<desc>Without warning Tomomi, Mikage and their friends are warped into a strange fantasy land. Now it's up to them to find their friends and get back to the real world.

Miracle Girls is based on the characters of the manga and anime of the same name. The player starts the game by picking either Tomomi or Mikage, although they both have the same abilities. Either can jump or toss candy, which will render enemies harmless for a few seconds as they eat it. Enemies incapacitated in this way can be used as platforms. Hidden in levels are bombs that fill the screen with candy, turning any onscreen enemies into heart rings, fruit that increase health, and doors that lead to a celestial slot machine that can reward additional lives. At the end of each level is a different challenge with a boss, such as a top-down squirt-gun fight or a game of matching cards.</desc>

		<name>Monstania</name>
		<desc>The hero of the game is Fron, a sixteen-year old boy who lives on the island of Monstania. One day, strolling in the forest, he notices a strange light. The light lead him to a clearing, and then suddenly disappeared. But Fron realized what was the meaning of that light - it was a fairy! Of course, everybody knew that fairies had been long extinct, but Fron never believed in that. All his life he wanted to meet a real fairy, and now, when the opportunity has come, he firmly decides to find her. His girlfriend Tia helps him on the dangerous journey, during which they meet a mysterious little girl named Chitta, and get involved in a grand adventure, that will ultimately lead them to the battle against the dark force that threatens the whole Monstania!

"Monstania" has a somewhat unusual gameplay within the frames of console RPGs. You don't explore the world in the game: it is entirely linear and takes you to the next destination by itself (only at a few points you can choose where to go next by selecting an appropriate answer). Once within the location, you cannot leave it until you complete all your objectives there, which then take you to the next location. The objective is usually a large strategic battle. You navigate your party members on the battle field, attack with melee and long-ranged weapons, and use special technique which require action points. Unlike most other turn-based strategy games, an enemy makes a move immediately after you did the same with one of your characters, without waiting for the "enemy turn". The RPG element is not very significant: your characters level up automatically after each battle. There are also some puzzles to solve in certain locations.</desc>

If every side of an object has a red outline, left by travelling around its circumference, the object vanishes and adds to the player's score, as well as dropping any objects sitting on top of it. The player has access to a single-use emergency satellite, which instantly eliminates everything within one third of the screen.nnnnThe game has a sci-fi theme, with a brief intro animation of the player's starship warping into a star system to begin the stage.

		<desc>Seven heroes from seven different Worlds. Seven heroes who were brought to a mysterious temple on a remote island and transformed into statues. Seven heroes who are chosen to bring harmony back to the universe: Miriene the witch (wizard), Lux the tetsujin (a race of iron people), Reeshina the grappler (monk), Tokio the ninja, Kamio the ogre, and Mesia the priestess. The seventh hero is you, the protagonist of the game - the knight Remeer or the female warrior Ferris. Your first task will be to release your companions from the statues they are locked in. You must travel to the Cat World and to retrieve an important artifact. But your main objective is to visit all the seven Worlds and to find seven mystic arks - the items that will re-unite those Worlds and bring peace to them.

"Mystic Ark" is a RPG closely connected to  7th Saga. You travel on overworld map, visit towns, buy equipment, and descend into dungeons. The combat is turn-based and viewed from a third-person "over-the-shoulder" perspective. The battles are not random: the enemies can be seen as white dots on your radar, and if you don't want to fight, you can sometimes outrun or avoid them. The game also contains elements of pure adventure: often you must investigate objects closely and use items from your inventory on them.</desc>

		<desc>The young fighter Ryu was thrown out of his father's home, and this childhood trauma has been dominating his life ever since. His only wish is to surpass his father and to show him he has become a better fighter than him. Laila is a cheerful treasure hunter. She dreams only of valuable things, adventure, travels, and life in the capital city.  Gaou is experiencing a personal tragedy: he wants to discover the mystery of the disappearance of a woman he loved, Asuka, aided by his best friend Froz. Naaga is a girl who wears a heavy armor, which - as she thinks - will prevent her from losing any battle. At present, she has problems since she owes a million gold pieces to her guild. What do those heroes have in common? As their ways cross, they will find out they are in fact pursuing one and the same goal...

"Burning Heroes" lets you start as either one of the four characters. Each one starts in a different place and is seemingly absorbed in his/her personal quest, but as the game progresses, the four heroes meet each other. You should also find and "unlock"  four other playable characters as you advance in the game. The gameplay system of "Burning Heroes" is similar to other console-style RPGs: you fight random enemies and bosses in turn-based combat, viewed from third-person perspective, like in  Final Fantasy games. As you get hit in a battle, your "passion" (literally "hot blood", nekketsu in Japanese) level rises, and the more damage you take, the quicker you reach 100%. Once the passion bar is full, you can summon a powerful monster and to unleash a devastating attack on the entire enemy party.</desc>

The heroes often use toys and mechs to defeat their incompetent opponents, such as the male protagonist's kendamagic.nnnnThe game is similar to First Star's Spy vs. Spy series, in that both teams are attempting to reach the treasure first. They can trip up their opponents via a number of traps, some of which have conditional uses. By burying mines and setting off missiles, the player can whittle down the health of their opponents as well as keep them off their tracks. If the two teams meet, they fight each other in a three-on-three tag team battle with the losing side taking a large hit to their health. The game can be played single-player (as either the Yatterman team or the Doronbo team) or multiplayer.</desc>

It also includes a recreation of the original 1979 game configured to work with the SNES controller. The game remains the same: the player, as a Heian-era policeman, must dig pits to catch carnivorous aliens and then bury them to destroy them. It takes three steps to dig a pit big enough, and aliens will quickly fill holes that aren't large enough. If an alien catches the policeman, he will be eaten.nnnnThe enhanced version adds wooden blocks that can be chopped down, but this takes as long as digging pits and puts the player in peril during the time it takes to remove them. The game also includes a two player versus mode that gives each player half the screen. When an alien is removed from one player's side, it appears on the other player's side, so players must quickly remove aliens so they don't get overwhelmed by the sheer numbers.</desc>

The game expands its scope a little, including more stage variation - including Mode 7 vehicle sections - and three new playable characters with the Kunoichi trio of Yuki, Tomomi and Oshige-chan. The Kunoichi are a trio of female ninjas in training that contrast with the three usual protagonists Rintarou, Kirimaru and Shinbei, occasionally tricking them.</desc>

		<name>Nintama Rantarou 3</name>
		<desc>Nintama Rantarou 3 ("Ninja Boy Rantarou 3") is an action-platforming game for the Super Famicom and the fifth game on the system to use the Nintama Rantarou license, based on a comedic children's manga and anime about a trio of ninja cadets. As with its predecessors, the game balances 2D platforming sections that relies on the trio's ninja skills with cutscenes and mini-games.

The game breaks up the game into sequences which the player can tackle in a semi-loose order. The grid of possible skits and stages to visit is limited at first, and more become available as others are completed.</desc>

It is also the fourth Super Famicom game to be based on the Nintama Rantarou manga and anime license, and most closely resembles the first game.nnnnThe game's story mode has the player move from character to character while cutscenes play, with some gameplay sequences to break it up. Shinbei's first sequence starts as an adventure game, and segues to a runaway horse sequence, while Rantarou and Kirimaru progress through side-scrolling levels. Rantarou can use a grappling hook to cross large gaps, while Kirimaru can climb mossy walls.</desc>

		<desc>Nintama Rantarou ("Ninja Boy Rantarou") is a platformer and the first of five games on the system to be based on the 1993 anime Nintama Rantarou, which was adapted from the manga Rakudai Ninja Rantarou, and features the lighthearted adventures of a bespectacled boy and his two best friends as they try to graduate ninja school.

As Rantarou, Shinbei or Kirimaru, the player progresses through a series of stages using their ninja powers to keep out of trouble. The first part of the game ties into the school setting with classes that teach the player vital mechanics in the game, such as climbing walls and crouching under projectiles.</desc>

		<name>Nontan to Issho : Kurukuru Puzzle</name>
		<desc>Nontan to Isshi: KuruKuru Puzzle ("Nontan and Friends: Round-and-Round Puzzle") is a puzzle game for the Super Famicom and Game Boy. It was released exclusively in Japan and is based on the Nontan books for younger children that follows the eponymous mischievous kitten and his animal friends on their adventures. The game is a twist on the standard block-stacking puzzle game.nnnnNontan to Isshi: KuruKuru Puzzle is one of the few games that Game Freak worked on before they created their breakout hit Pokémon.nnnnThe goal of Nontan to Isshi: KuruKuru Puzzle is to stack blocks so that two matching icons are connected to one another adjacently and vanish. The player cannot rotate the two-piece blocks that fall from the top: instead, they flip the blocks around to reveal two different blocks on the opposite side. Most of the flipped blocks are linked to their originals: a fish becomes a fish skeleton, an apple becomes an apple half, etc. Sometimes they're rare bee or character face blocks instead: both are rare and are therefore difficult to clear once one appears, but two face blocks will eliminate an entire row when connected and are thus worth the hassle.nnnnThe game has an endless single-player mode that only ends once the blocks reach the top of the screen. There is also a two-player mode.</desc>

		<desc>Olivia's Mystery is a puzzle game. It features a story, told with scrolling text, that every so often segues to one of the game's puzzles.

The game's puzzles resemble normal jigsaw puzzles: the player has to take several pieces, often flipping them vertically or horizontally, and place them in their correct locations on a grid. The complication is that the image is animating in a constant loop. Often, this provides a hint as to the correct orientation of the piece (if a figure is climbing a wall, for instance, all the wall pieces should be scrolling downwards), but is often used by the game to be disorienting.</desc>

Each fight is a "death match" and seven of these must be fought in order to be crowned the champion. While this game feels like a Street Fighter II clone with a wrestling theme, it manages to capture the spirit of having the fighter with the best 2-out-of-3 rounds win the fight.
Each character has a gauge based on his spiritual strength (soul), physical strength (root), and mental strength (mind). The spirit of the player's characters can be recharged by getting the character to yell at the opponent</desc>

Doing so flips all of the opponent's tiles between the two, awarding them to the player. It's generally imperative to reach the boundary of the board, and especially the corners, as pieces placed there are in more defensible positions.</desc>

		<desc>Ou-chan no Oekaki Logic is a digital conversion, with anime mascots, of the classic Japanese newspaper puzzle nonograms. A nonogram is a puzzle on a square or rectangular grid the object of which is to reveal a hidden picture. Along each row and column there is a number or series of numbers which indicate how many squares will be colored in that row or grid. Example; "5 9 4" would mean there would be sets of five, nine, and four colored squares in the grid, in that order, with at least one blank in between. 

Ou-chan no Oekaki Logic adds a story mode where Ou-Chan, representing the player, competes with other blobby anime characters in finding hidden images in the nonogram grids.</desc>

Tetris Attack is a fact-paced action puzzler featuring the colorful cast of characters from Yoshi's Island. A stack of blocks continually rises from the bottom of the screen, and the player controls a cursor which can swap any two blocks horizontally. Make a row or column of three or more and they'll clear, potentially creating combos from new blocks falling to take their place. Combos will send large garbage blocks to your opponent, which must be eliminated by clearing a piece that is touching it, turning it into normal blocks.

The game offers a story mode against the computer, as well as a 2-player versus mode, an endless mode, a timed mode where a certain number of blocks must be cleared, and a puzzle mode where a set arrangement of blocks must be cleared in a specific number of moves. The game is based on the Japan-only title Panel de Pon.</desc>

		<name>Pipe Dream</name>
		<desc>Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.

Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to  replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.

Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".</desc>

		<name>Popeye : Ijiwaru Majo Sea Hag no Maki</name>
		<desc>Popeye Ijiwaru Majo: Sea Hag no Maki ("Popeye and the Harassing Witch Sea Hag") is a Popeye platformer-action game from Technos Japan. After Popeye trounces his nemesis the Sea Hag, she gets her revenge by separating all of Popeye's friends from their lifeforce, causing them to turn to stone. Popeye has to recover all their life energy (in the form of hearts) from a board game-like grid while avoiding the various heavies that have been sent to deter him, including his rival Bluto who is hoping to win Olive Oyl's heart by rescuing her first.nnnnEach stage takes place in a grid, and Popeye moves around by rolling a die and moving one to six spaces around the board. Some tiles allow him to purchase upgrades, recover health, move to other map squares and play through small platforming sequences. Occasionally, Popeye can bump into moving enemies on the map (similar to the overworld enemies in Super Mario Bros. 3) and fight a quick one-on-one battle with them for bonuses. His goal is to land on every square with a heart on it and find the heart in the stage somewhere. By collecting them all, Popeye saves a friend and moves onto the next board.nnnnThe game was released only in Japan for the Super Famicom.</desc>

		<name>Popful Mail</name>
		<desc>In this platform action game, you play as a cute bounty hunter known as Popful Mail. While you might think that a cute Anime chick would have no trouble making a living slashing bad guys with her sword, Popful is having a hard time making ends meet.  One day, however, Popful learns about a magician who has gone rogue and has a hefty bounty on his head. So, her adventure begins as Popful fights her way through a new adventure, and makes new friends along the way.

Primarily this is an action game with very slight RPG elements. As you make your way through the plethora of levels, you will have to collect money from slain foes. You use this money in the shops to buy weapons, armor, health, and so on. Also, this game features interaction with many, many characters through both on-screen dialog and fully animated sequences. Some of these characters become playable as you progress through the game.

This release has the same story and general gameplay style as the  earlier version, but otherwise was made from scratch, having entirely different graphics, locations, enemies, challenges, etc.</desc>

The game uses the mascots of the Nippon Professional Baseball league as its playable characters, and is licensed to use the team names and mascot characters.nnnnThe game features standard versus modes and a puzzle mode where the player has to remove all the blocks in a limited number of moves.nnnnThe goal of the game is identical to that of Puyo Puyo: players remove blocks on their screen by stacking four or more icons of the same color in any arrangement, as long as it forms a contiguous unbroken line. By setting up chain reactions of eliminations, the player can create trash that gets dropped on their opponent, making their game harder.nnnnPro Yakyuu Nettou Puzzle Stadium adds extra features to coincide with the baseball theme: one player is "batting" while the other is "pitching", and the game alternates which player is which. The goal of the former is to create combos and quickly eliminate sets to fill bases, which eventually leads to points on the table. The goal of the latter is to quickly eliminate sets so they can be the batting player again. The pitching player has the advantage, as trash vanishes quicker for them, which means the batting player has to move fast to score any points before they change back over.</desc>

		<desc>Psycho Dream is a side-scrolling action game with light platforming elements, similar in style to Valis games, though less story-driven. The game is set in predominantly modern-day environments. The player can choose to control either Ryo Shizima or Maria Tobari, two demon hunters who must save an innocent girl named Sayaka and rid the world of rampaging monsters. The two protagonists share the same stages; only single-player mode is available.nnnnBoth demon hunters rely mostly on close-range attacks - Ryo with a sword, Maria with a whip, though they can also use guns. Most of the gameplay consists of slowly walking through monster-infested areas, eliminating enemies and avoiding obstacles, which often requires jumping and ducking. Power-ups are obtained from fallen foes. Depending on their color, these power-ups can increase the attack level of a weapon, envelop the character in a protective force field, or restore his/her health. Rare red power-ups are unique to each character: Ryo dons a special armor that hits enemies with bouncing lasers, while Maria gets in touch with her angelic nature, growing wings and firing homing energy balls.</desc>

The protagonist's village is suddenly attacked one day by a demonic presence that drops hundreds of colored blocks on the panicked citizens. The hero decides to fight back by removing them all and defeating the demon.nnnnThe game is a combination of Puzznic and Sokoban/Boxxle. In order to remove these blocks, they need to be lined up with blocks of a similar color. Pushing a block causes it to keep moving until it either hits another block or a wall. The stage can only be completed if every block is removed, so the player needs to be careful not to leave remainders: while lines of three are sufficient, if there's four or five blocks of the same color the player needs to figure out how to line them all up at the same time.</desc>

		<path>./Ranma 1-2 - Akanekodan Teki Hihou (Japan) (Translated En).zip</path>
		<name>Ranma 1/2 : Akanekodan Teki Hihou</name>
		<desc>The game is based on the animÃ© series Ranma 1/2. It tells the story of the young martial artist Ranma Saotome. Traveling with his father Genma across China, Ranma discovered a cursed spring. When he and his father fell into that spring, they were both transformed: Ranma into a little girl, Genma into a panda bear. Hot water restored them to their original appearance, but whenever they are splashed with cold water, they turn into their "cursed" forms. 

The story of the game begins as Ranma and Genma are having breakfast by their friends. Suddenly, several cat-like creatures burst in and kidnap Genma. Ranma finds out that the cats belonged to Akaneko (Crimson Cat) Gang, who kidnaps strong fighters for some reason. Soon Ranma discovers that Kamusaru, the leader of the Crimson Cat Gang, is looking for an ancient treasure that will allow him to turn into a Nekomaou (Cat Demon King), and take over the world. Ranma and his friends will do anything to rescue Genma and to stop Kamusaru's evil plans!

The game features many characters from the animÃ©, including Ranma's fiancee Akane, the fighter Ryouga, the amazon warrior Shampoo who is in love with Ranma, and others. The game is built like a traditional Japanese RPG: your party fights random enemies in turn-based combat viewed from a third-person, Final Fantasy-like perspective. In battles, you can attack physically, or use various offensive and defensive techniques, which consume "ki" (an equivalent of magic points). Not only Ranma and Genma, but also the other characters in your parties can take a different shape. You carry around a bucket of cold water, and every time you use it on one of your characters, he/she is transformed into a "cursed" form. This is sometimes required to advance the story of the game (for example, Ranma can enter a certain location only as a girl).

As in previous games the premise simply involves the cast of the series going at each other's throats for ultimate supremacy, although this time you can select any character in either the single player or Vs gameplay modes.

The gameplay itself involves controlling your character in a side-scrolling arena and trying to defeat your opponent either with your basic attacks, special moves (triggered by specific controller motions) or super moves that require you to charge buttons and can only be dealt under specific situations (ie, when your life-bar starts flashing), while avoiding your opponent's attacks in turn.

		<desc>A 2D one-on-one fighting game based on the Ranma 1/2 manga series dealing with the adventures of a male martial artist cursed to transform into a female version of himself when splashed with water.

Ranma 1/2 : Chougi Ranbu Hen pits 12 characters from the series (including the male and female versions of Ranma) against each other in best 2-out-of-3 rounds matches, with the goal being to defeat all the opponents and thus claim a magical lucky cat that will grant the champion whatever he wishes.

Gameplay involves controlling your character in a 2D scrolling arena, in which you attempt to defeat your opponent by using your basic attacks and special moves, all the while avoiding your opponent's strikes. You can also charge up your character until he reaches "super" mode, which allows you to unleash super moves for extra damage, but performing any basic attack negates the super mode.

Features the standard single player and Vs modes along with a Tag Team Vs mode in which two players select a pair of characters and can exchange them in mid-fight for strategic advantage.</desc>

Gameplay is similar to other one-on-one beat 'em ups, in which you control your characters movements and attacks in a scrolling 2D plane attempting to defeat your opponent with special moves (triggered by specific controller motions) and avoid his attacks.
The single player story mode allows you to choose the male and female versions of Ranma and then takes you through 7 best 2-out-of-3 matches against a collection of characters from the series, while a 2-player Vs mode allows you to freely select any of the characters without restrictions.

		<name>Ranma 1/2 : Ougi Jaanken</name>
		<desc>The game involves falling blocks of hands displaying the rock, paper, and scissors signs, which fall three at a time. In a similar manner to Tetris, the player can rotate the blocks to stack them, using pieces that defeat other pieces (e.g. paper over rock) to eliminate stacks. Doing so adds garbage pieces onto the opponent's screen to make it more difficult for them to eliminate their stacks of blocks. The objective is to fill up the opponent's screen up with blocks so that additional ones can no longer fit. Each character has two special attacks which can be used when large combinations are completed. Once in each round each player can also use a bucket of water that can transform a cursed character into their alternate form, which weakens their attacks until the effect wears off. This does not affect Akane or the Gambling King.</desc>

		<desc>At long last, Mega Man had finally manage to beat the evil Dr. Wily! With this defeat, Wily was thrown in jail, seemingly for good. The world would no longer be subject to his madness.

But remember, Dr. Wily is mad, but he's not stupid. He had a backup plan...and all he had to do was just wait...

6 months had passed, and somewhere from deep within Wily's abandoned lab, 4 hidden capsules activated and opened. His backup plan was in action...he had hidden 4 new Wily Robots that would spring him out of jail so he could continue his mad reign.

When Mega Man hears the word that Wily was busting out of prison, he rushes onto the scene, only to encounter a strange robot he had never seen before named Bass. Bass tells Mega Man to back off, that he would stop Wily, and that Mega Man was no longer needed.

Think that's gonna stop Mega Man? No way! Mega Man takes off to put a stop to Dr. Wily and find out exactly whose side Bass is on...</desc>

		<name>Rokudenashi Blues : Taiketsu! Tokyo Shitennou</name>
		<desc>Rokudenashi Blues ("Good-for-Nothing Blues") is a RPG brawler based on the manga of the same name, which also saw two anime movie adaptations close to its release. The player character, Taison Maeda, is a delinquent student who is training to be a professional boxer. He has a reputation as a powerful fighter among delinquent gangs as a result, though despite being violent he has a code of honor.

The Famicom and Super Famicom versions of the game are subtly different due to console differences, but both share their genre, developer and publisher. The Famicom game was released in October 1993, with the Super Famicom version following in April 1994.

Characters from this game have appeared in Jump crossover games, specifically Famicom Jump II and Jump Ultimate Stars.</desc>

		<name>Romancing Sa-Ga 3</name>
		<desc>Every 300 years the Death Eclipse kills all newly born creatures. Men, women, and children, animals and plants, even ferocious monsters - no one can survive the devastation caused by the Eclipse. No one except a child chosen by the destiny. 600 years ago, such a child survived the Death Eclipse, only to become a demon king. During the next Eclipse, a chosen child became a holy king, and he defeated the evil demon king. Now, when the next Eclipse is nearing, nobody knows who the next fortunate survivor will become - a demon or a holy man?

In "Romancing SaGa 3", you can play through the story controling any one of the eight main characters - Julian, Monica, Mikhael, Harid, Katarina, Thomas, Elena, and Sarah. The story is common for all eight characters, and they often join together and share the same piece of a story. The princess Monica learns about a rebellion planned by a treacherous Baron to dethrone her brother, Marquis Mikhael. She goes to warn him, but on her way, she loses her horse, and has to stop in an inn of the town Shinnon. There, she meets travelers who agree to lend her a horse and accompany her to see her brother. When they finally reach Mikhael, a war begins...

"Romancing SaGa 3" has a refined upgrading system: you can upgrade your weapons and your spells by using them continuously. The party combat is turn-based, and there are also strategic army-vs.-army battles you'll have to command.</desc>

		<name>Romancing Sa-Ga</name>
		<desc>Once upon a time, three evil gods fought against the holy gods, and the holy God-Father chose a human warrior to help them. Finally, after a prolonged, terrible war, the leader of the three evil gods - Death, the eldest of them - surrendered. The youngest evil god, Schirach, became a human and has lost her powers. The middle one, Saruin, was sealed away in the dark world. Now, after thousand years have passed, and the seal of Saruin has weakened, it is time for you, the hero of the new generation, to defeat him.

Romancing SaGa is the fourth installment in the long SaGa series - non-linear role-playing games with several main heroes. It is the first of three Super Nintendo entries. The first three games in the series were on the Gameboy and were known as "Final Fantasy Legend" outside of Japan. In this game, you play the stories of eight characters, which will later unite to face the ultimate evil. The eight characters belong to different classes and have different abilities. There are four male characters (noble son, thief, adventurer, and pirate), and four female ones (nomad, ranger, dancer, and savage). The combat is turn-based, with enemies visible on screen. Taking a cue from Final Fantasy II on the NES, instead of "Leveling" your character as a whole you level specific abilities such as a type of weapon or magic, as well as, stats such as HP and Strength and Intelligence. New to this entry abilities are randomly unlocked during battle as a light-bulb appears over the characters head and the new ability is unleashed to the surprise of friend and foe. This serendipitous element of gameplay along with the multiple heroes to choose from greatly enhance the replay value as no two playthroughs are alike. Which is good considering the steep learning curve of the SaGa games which require multiple playthroughs to truly master the system.

"Romancing SaGa" was never released outside of Japan until the Playstation 2 remake "Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song"</desc>

		<name>Rudra no Hihou</name>
		<desc>The Earth is ruled by heavenly powers, who destroy it and create it again every 4000 years, to end the live of powerful races and to let new ones appear. Many years ago, four great races dominated the Earth: the wise Danans, the beautiful Mermaids, the proud Reptiles, and the strong Giants. But those races had to give place to a newly born race: the humans. During the era of the humans, the planet's air has become filled with smog and the water dirty with pollutants. The cult of the Rudra have appeared and begun fortelling the end of the world. As the 4000 year deadline approaches, three characters each embark on their separate yet intertwined quests.

Sion is a young warrior who wants to take part in a ritual tournament and become the strongest of the kingdom. However a capture of one of the Cultists of Rudras soon complicates his training.

Surlet is a wise magician who is interested in archeology and history of the Earth. He is also a pupil of the famous professor Muench who recently made a very important discovery regarding ancient ruins

Riza is a young druid who lives with her grandfather in a quiet village. She was born with a mysterious jade on her forehead, and now feels the urge to save the world from an inevitable, yet unknown disaster.

Rundra no Hiho is a turn-based RPG, similar in gameplay and graphics to the better known Final Fantasy VI. Whenever players load the game cartridge, they are able to  choose which of the three characters they wish to play. This allows any one of these quests to be saved and put aside for any amount of time, allowing the player to change between characters as they so desire. Regardless of which character is chosen, the game is displayed as a top-view on the overworld and in towns. Players can move around to different locations, search treasure chests and talk to townspeople. On the overworld and in dungeons, random encounters can occur. During battles the game is displayed from a side-view and is turn-based between the player's characters and monsters. Players are able to Fight with their weapon, use mantras (magic), use items, defend or run away. Defeat of monsters will result in the party earning experience points and money, which can be spent to buy new weapons, armor and items.

The game's mantra (magic) system is unique in that all spells are formed up of syllables, each with it's own effect (for instance, the syllable "Ig" represents fire and the syllable "ga" augments any mantra's power over it's basic form. Therefore "Igga" is a more powerful version than "Ig" alone). Syllables must be arranged in proper combinations in order to form effective magic spells. Hints towards some of these combinations can be found inside treasure chests or by talking to townspeople.

		<desc>It's the year 2015 and the most powerful organization of the planet, a company named Deutschland Moldavia, is threatening to take over the world by genetically manipulatin humans into mindless slaves or powerful monsters.

The Peace Keepers is a side-scrolling fighting game similar to games in the Final Fight series. The player can choose from four characters (plus two that become available later in the game) with different strengths and weaknesses. In addition to combinations of standard attacks, jump-, run-  and throwing attacks, all characters can also block attacks, perform single heavy attacks, special attacks that consume a certain amount of energy and super attacks. Super attacks damage all enemies on-screen, but can only be used twice per continue. If a character is hit repeatedly, there is a chance that they temporarily switch into "angry-mode" during which they are invincible and more powerful. 

Most levels offer different paths and exits, and after every level, a different character may be selected. This means that levels may be played through in different orders and that it is not at all necessary to play through all the levels to reach one of several endings.</desc>

Rather than featuring real teams and drivers from Formula 1, it features ten anthropomorphic characters riding very small versions of the various Formula 1 open-wheel vehicles. It still features the licenses of FOCA and Fuji Television, two organizations that control the Formula 1 licensing rights in Japan.

The game is loosely inspired by Super Mario Kart and its imitators. The game depicts the course from behind the player's vehicle, with the second half of the screen taken up by either the second human player (if applicable) or an overhead map of the course and the progress of all the competitors. Uncommon for a cart racer, SD F-1 Grand Prix allows the player to earn money based on how they ranked and use that money to upgrade their vehicle between races.</desc>

		<name>Secret of Mana</name>
		<desc>Once upon a time, the power of Mana was used by all people and helped their civilization grow. But as evil forces took control of Mana Fortress, there was no way out but a war which destroyed the Mana-based civilization but eventually brought peace to people. The events of the past became but legends to the new generation of humans. But history repeats itself... One day, a young village boy finds a rusty sword stuck at the bottom of a river. He doesn't know this sword is the famous Mana sword, the one that won so many battles before. By drawing the sword out of the river bottom, the boy unwillingly summons hordes of monsters, and is expelled from his village. A mysterious knight Jema is the only man who helps him and gives him instructions for the future. First, he must repair the sword, and then, with its help, take control of Mana seeds which can be found in eight great castles.

"Secret of Mana" is an action RPG, featuring real-time hack-and-slash type of a combat. Like in Quest for Glory games, you have a stamina gauge. The more stamina you have, the more powerful your strike is. You upgrade your weapons and abilities and meet many different types of monsters, while roaming around the country and performing your quests.</desc>

		<name>Seiken Densetsu 3</name>
		<desc>Seiken Densetsu 3 is set in the same world as the two previous Seiken Densetsu games (the first is Final Fantasy Adventure, and the second is most known as Secret of Mana). The mysterious power of Mana is also the center of all events in Seiken Densetsu 3. Years have passed, and all the destructive powers of Mana have been securely sealed by Mana Swords into eight seeds, all placed in eight different kingdoms. But some people know about those sealed powers, and they don't want to free them for the sake of humanity, but for their own gain - such as the kingdom of Altena, which is slowly freezing and which can be saved only by the legendary powers.

The game features several plot lines connected to each other by their common background. In the beginning of the game, you are offered to choose a group of three among six different characters of different classes: Duran the Fighter, Angela the Magic User, Lisa the Amazon, Carlie the Cleric, Kevin the Grappler and Hawk the Thief. Each one of them has her/his own background story and dwells in a different land. Gradually, the connections between those different characters become apparent, and the seemingly loose story lines are connected into a whole.

Seiken Densetsu 3, like the previous game of the series, is an action RPG, with real time combat.</desc>

		<desc>A 2D side-scrolling beat 'em up, Sengoku casts you and a friend as two renegade fighters out to beat the crap out of the many assorted gangs that threaten the post-apocalyptic cities of the future. Unfortunately for them they also get caught in a time-warping scheme caused by the evil Nobunaga who attempts to invade the time period with mythical warriors and evil creatures from the Japanese sengoku period.

The game thus takes you from the city to a spirit-realm from time to time, in which you must fight all sorts of Japanese mythical figures, and release three haunted spirits that can aid you in your battle. Collecting orbs from defeated enemies allows you heal up, gain weapons and even energy attacks and also summon the warrior forms of the spirits you released, which change your character's form and give you a new collection of attacks and powers.

		<name>Shijou Saikyou League Serie A : Ace Striker</name>
		<desc>ShijÅ SaikyÅ League Serie A: Ace Striker  is a 1995 Japan-exclusive football video game for the Super Famicom.

Ace Striker was licensed by Italian Football League and AIC (Associazione Italiana Calciatori) featuring all clubs and footballers from the Italian Serie A (Season 1994â95).

The football players are drawn in the "deformed" anime style. There's no different formations to choose from, but all the players (except the goalkeeper) can be positioned anywhere in the field. During a football match, an animated image will appear whenever a goal is scored. One of the particularities or flaws of this soccer game is that during the penalty shoot-out, the goalkeeper can move and jump before the rival player actually kicks the ball.</desc>

The events of this game take place 20 or 30 years after the hero of the first game followed the neutral path, defeated the Asura Lord and the seraph Michael at the Cathedral, and founded a state where followers of both Law and Chaos ideals could live freely. But his reign of freedom doesn't last long. The Mesia faith gains power, expanding the Cathedral into a new enclosed environment named Millenium. The Gaians rise up, but their rebellion is repressed by the Mesians' elite warrior class, the Temple Knights. Some years later, a retired arena fighter Okamoto discovers a man fighting for his life against a demon. He rescues the man, who doesn't even remember his own name, and trains him to fight in the arena so they might both go on to a better living in one of the upper-class areas of Millenium. And thus the new battle for a better future begins...

Problem is they are innocent and   the lookalike killers are still out there! Kunio and his pal now have to break out of the prison and go kick some butt in the name of justice (and to clear their names of course).

Gameplay involves defeating all opponents using your arsenal of attacks and special moves (as well as any weapons you may find around) and completing the many side scrolling stages that make up the game, usually after beating an end level boss.

Kunio and Riki are not alone in their quest, as their hard boiled girlfriends, Misako and Kyouko, can join up and provide their unique collection of special moves to the mix. Biking sequences in which you try to get to another part of town while fending-off opponents  Road Rash-style are also added for additional gameplay and the game uses several non-interactive cutscenes and dialogues to carry the plot forward.</desc>

She also has a sense for justice - if a village or a town is in trouble, Lina will do anything to protect it and to fight the bad guys! In the game, Lina is knocked down after a fight against mysterious attackers, and is found by the inhabitants of the nearby village. The trouble is, she can't remember anything! When she meets her long-time companion Naga, their first objective become to investigate the goblin attacks on the population, but Lina's ultimate quest is to regain her memory and to find out who or what has attacked her.

The game is a traditional console-style RPG with towns, dungeons, random enemies, and turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective, in a Dragon Warrior fashion. The characters can attack physically or use special attacks. Lina can also cast various magical spells. You cannot travel on the world map, but "jump" to various locations instead. The game features animé-style cut scenes.</desc>

The player controls Woodstock and direct Snoopy as he performs all sorts of errands for different Peanuts characters. The player does a separate game for each character; some of them require him to do a little detective work, or to direct Snoopy to win a race, or to get a character to some place. The ultimate goal in the game is to get everyone in shape for Snoopy's concert. Games can either be played using stereo or monoaural sound.

The music was composed by Hirokazu Tanaka and Minako Hamano (??????),[2] in addition to arrangements of the familiar works of Vince Guaraldi known to longtime Peanuts fans. Many years later the game has been translated to English (by Aeon Genesis) and Portuguese.</desc>

You must reach the end of each stage before time runs out, and get all the power-ups and items laid in each maze in hopes of getting to Goemon alive.</desc>

The game includes two modes: a single-player elimination tournament against increasingly difficult computer opponents, and a versus mode for up to two players.

In the single-player mode, the player can only choose from two characters: Phoenix and Tiki. The two characters fight almost identically. They fight through the other six characters from the versus mode and a "clone fight" against the character they did not select. Beating the game leads to the ending and a password (A, B, L, R, X, Y, Start) that allows players to select the same character as their opponent in versus mode.</desc>

A small twist in this game is that instead of choosing the traditional bomberman or a country specific character players get to choose between bosses from the previous game when playing battle mode.  Each character has a special power from a jet pack to throwing abilities.</desc>

		<name>Super Fire Pro Wrestling : Queen's Special</name>
		<desc>Long before the WWE introduced the Divas wrestling matches, in Japan there was a more serious affair, where wrestling skill was more important than breast implants, and matches were "real" (as far as wrestling goes) instead of pillow-fighting or bra and panties fights.

In this game in the Fire Pro Series, the cast of the All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling promotion are available, all fighting to win the Red belt, the highest prize of the federation. It's also possible to fight in single matches, tournaments, Battle Royal and Elimination matches. The usual array of options in CAW is present, being possible to create 16 new Wrestlers.

Gameplay, as usual is the series, is dramatically different than in most western games. Each wrestler has a bunch of moves, ranked from weak to strong. While it's possible to connect any of them from open situations, while grappling only when the opponent is already beaten the most powerful moves can be successfully used.

		<desc>Super Fire Pro Wrestling 3 Final Bout was released in 1993. This is the first game ever created with contribution from Goichi Suda. Due to complaints about the game's difficulty, Human released "Super Fire Pro Wrestling 3 Easy Type". In this version there is no edit mode but all of the hidden wrestlers are unlocked.

Characters based on wrestling stars such as WWF's Hulk Hogan and WCW's Rick Rude are featured in the game along with Japanese professional wrestlers like Masahiro Chono. Each wrestler is ranked based on their attacking ability, defensive ability, and their running speed. An "edit mode" allows customized wrestlers to be created based on their wrestling type, the color of their skin, and a unique set of customized ring attire. A certain amount of points also have to be spent on developing certain attacks (and their respective defense against these attacks from opposing wrestlers). Digitized voices from the wrestlers and cheers from the audience members are included. Two of the buttons on the Super Famicom controller are used for strong blows while another button is used strictly for low blows. Sprites in the game actually show wrestlers in different sizes to each other (depending on height and weight). A battle royale mode permits four wrestlers to face off against each other simultaneously. There are 56 different wrestlers to control; with eight playable wrestling legends. Referees are available and can be chosen by the player; each referee has his own level of strictness and essentially determine how long the match will last. It is possible to perform up to 300 different professional wrestling moves in the game.</desc>

To make them fight more realistically when controlled by the AI, the CAW mode also allows one to set move priorities.

Five game modes are available, including World Championship (single and tag), Battle Royale, 5-man Elimination Mode, League Battle and the One Night Dream Match. There are several referees available (each with their own quirks) and variant rules, from allowing fighting outside the ring without count-out (or disallowing it) to the disabling of disqualifications from illegal moves.</desc>

It was released on the same day as another Serie A soccer game developed by a Japanese studio: Shijou Saikyou League Serie A: Ace Striker from TNN.nnnnThe game was released alongside two alternate versions:nnnn- The Extra Package version which included a special booklet with stats and data on all 396 players in the Serie A league.nn- A promotional version sponsored by UCC Xaqua, a soft drink endorsed by the Italian Football League and the footballer Roberto Baggio that consumers could win by entering a postcard competition. This particular edition had a very limited distribution.nnnnThe game uses sprite-scaling for its presentation, displaying the pitch from an angled vertical perspective in which the far side of the pitch is always visible, though becomes smaller or larger the closer the player is to the opposing goal. It also includes the player name across the bottom of the screen for whoever has possession of the ball at the time, making it easier to track what certain players are doing.</desc>

This was a common copyright-avoidance tactic Human Entertainment utilized for their Fire Pro Wrestling games.nnnnAs with previous Super Famicom entries, the game uses a distinctive perspective that employs Mode 7 to present a Z-axis view of the pitch, with the player's goal is at the "bottom" of the screen and the opponent's goal is at the far end. The game has multiple modes, including exhibition matches and tournaments, and can support up to four players in a number of team configurations.</desc>

The game makes a few significant changes to the original Super Gussun Oyoyo. The most apparent of which is its new setting of a tropical island with an active volcano: many stages will start dropping fireballs the longer the player takes, which must be avoided at all costs. The game also features a new "Puzzle Mode" which plays similarly to those found in Tetris sequels: the player has a limited number of pre-determined pieces and must figure out how to use them to get their little bald friend to the end.</desc>

		<name>Super Gussun Oyoyo</name>
		<desc>Super Gussun Oyoyo is an extremely cute action/puzzle game by Banpresto, and conversion of Irem's arcade game of the same name originally released in 1993. The game is an interesting and unique crossover between the 'puzzly' side of Tetris and the 'save all the rodents' side of Lemmings. The goal of the game is to guide a bald and fun looking creature, who also happens to be a treasure hunter called Gussun (and his friend Oyoyo in two players mode), to the level's exit. This character just keeps walking around and gets scared at the silliest things. While he aimlessly wanders around the playfield, Tetris like pieces fall from the top of the screen, and the player must rotate and position them in the scene. Once in place, these blocks can be used by Gussun to climb on to reach new areas, and eventually lead him through the exit door. Tons of other features are also packed with the game, such as bombs or little buddies who follow Gussun to the exit (collect 10 of them for an extra life!). Time is of course limited and water starts filling up the stage if players stay in one levels for too long. Additionally, traps and monsters soon appear and things get quickly tricky and will squeeze the juice out of the player's brain in no time. An intense two-player versus mode and a level editor are also available.</desc>

		<name>Super Mario RPG : Legend of the Seven Stars</name>
		<desc>Super Mario RPG is a console RPG starring none other than Nintendo's popular character Mario. This game starts off like almost every other Mario game, with Bowser kidnapping Princess Toadstool. However, when Mario goes to Bowser's Keep to save her, a giant sword made by the evil Smithy crashes into the castle and sends Mario, the Princess, and Bowser flying to separate parts of the world.

The game plays much like a traditional RPG: Mario and the members of his party gain experience points by defeating enemies. These experience points can increase the team's maximum number of hit points and flower points (magic points). The battles are also turn-based, but this time there are timed attacks and defenses. Timed attacks allow you to inflict more harm than normal to an enemy. Timed defenses, on the other hand, allow an enemy to inflict less harm than normal. You are only allowed to have three out of five team members on your party at a time. Mario is always in your party, regardless. Your team members can also purchase more weapons and abilities, along with better armor.

		<desc>The events of Yoshi's Island take place in the past. Mario was one of two twin brothers whom the evil Magikoopa Kamek tried to kidnap. Kamek kidnapped one of the brothers, but the second, Mario, fell down on Yoshi's island, where Yoshis live. The Yoshis decided to carry baby Mario and to bring him to his parents. But Kamek has sent troops and hordes of monsters to stop the Yoshis and to kidnap Mario.

In the game, players control the differently colored Yoshis most of the time. Mario is a helpless baby unless a star that makes him invincible is collected. As a Yoshi, players can swallow enemies to make eggs; these eggs are used for attacking other enemies and activating switches. Yoshi can do a flutter jump to clear large gaps that a regular jump can't. Players can also pound the ground for attacks and also flipping certain switches. Additionally, Yoshis can transform into vehicles, such as a helicopter, submarine, or a train. If Mario is dismounted from a Yoshi, a countdown will start, and Yoshi must catch the baby before Kamek's servants kidnap it. When Mario is invincible, he doesn't ride on Yoshi and is immune to attack. While invincible, Mario can run up certain walls.

		<name>Super Metroid</name>
		<desc>Super Metroid is a follow-up to Metroid II, and once again features bounty hunter Samus Aran. She heads to planet Zebes in order to hunt down the leaders of the Space Pirates, who kidnapped an unique Metroid larva. 

Super Metroid is a platform game, which, like the previous Metroid games, is not divided into separate levels; the planet Zebes is an open world which Samus traverses back and forth. This world is divided into rooms separated with doors which must be shot to be opened. Shooting is also used to open up secret passages, some of which contain nifty bonuses, but finding most of them is required to proceed in the game. 

There are many items to find on the way, and each new item usually makes heretofore inaccessible areas available to Samus. The items include both weaponry (such as missiles, super missiles, or upgrades to Samus's standard laser gun), energy tanks that increase Samus' max health, and other gadgets (like a grappling hook that allows Samus to stick to the ceiling). 

There are various enemies - alien fauna - lurking around planet Zebes. The enemies all respawn after re-entering a room, though Samus' increasing capabilities mean that they become easier to defeat as the player makes progress. After killing them, the enemies typically leave behind some health or ammo.</desc>

		<desc>Super Naxat Open is the spiritual successor to Naxat Open, a golf game that Naxat published and lent their name to. The game uses the standard top-down perspective for golf games from this era.nnnnIt is unusual for the inclusion of Naxat's Dorabocchan ("Little Dorabo") character, who had appeared in two games at this point: 1990's Makai Prince Dorabocchan for the PC Engine and 1993's Chou Makai Taisen: Dorabocchan for SNES, best known as The Twisted Tales of Spike McFang in the US. Dorabocchan/Spike's inherent magical talent allows him to beneficially manipulate his game, which appears in the form of magical cards he can play before taking a swing. The player can also choose to play as five other characters from the franchise, as well as a choice of six caddies.</desc>

		<name>Super Nazo Puyo : Rulue no Roux</name>
		<desc>A spin-off of the successful action puzzle series Puyo Puyo with a twist. Whereas the main Puyo Puyo games are aimed at defeating AI or human controlled opponents in puzzle duels (where each player has his own play area in which color-coded "puyos" fall and must clear them out faster than his opponent). Nazo Puyo instead challenges the player with different single-player scenarios in which a specific objective must be completed (such as clearing only the red Puyos, or performing a specific sequence of combos, etc.).

The game uses the mold of a top-down RPG in which you control the young magician Arle as she explores towns and dungeons in her search for adventure. Each quest involves finding an NPC who will trigger one of the aforementioned scenarios and rewards Arle with experience points and unique items that increase her stats.

You play as the young magician Arle as she sets out looking for adventure all over the land, chatting with NPCs and exploring the game world via a standard top-down RPG interface. Quests involve careful exploration and solving Nazo Puyo challenges which involve specific scenarios of puzzle-based gameplay which the player must solve under a specific timeframe. These sequences give the player a play area in which color-coded "puyos" are pre-arranged in different patterns, and the player must position and arrange the ones that start to fall in order to fullfil the objective at hand (clear only a certain row or color of puyos, reach a certain number of combos, etc.). Additionally, running into specific monsters can trigger standard Puyo Puyo duels, in which both players have their own play areas and the objective is to clear the screen faster than the opponent.

During the 1 player game the player selects 1 of 13 fictional teams and plays the other 12 teams in a row. The overall goal, instead of just merely winning baseball games, is to play the perfect game and get a perfect rating. During a game, players start with an overall rating of a 100, and then after the game is finished game points are added or subtracted in 13 different rated categories such as number of errors made, the number of walks, pitched, number of times struck out, etc... The players final game points determines the difficulty level of their next opponent. The game has up to 5 difficulty rankings. Scoring a perfect 100 game points on a level 5 rated team will complete the game.

Both pitching and hitting are done from a behind the pitcher viewpoint and players can select whether to turn the designated hitter rule on or off.

		<desc>Super Sokoban (or Soukoban) is a puzzle game in which the player must push crates around a maze to their designated storage area, ensuring they do not accidentally push a crate into a position where it cannot be recovered. Thinking Rabbit created the original game in 1982 on home computers, and Super Sokoban is the first Super Famicom game to follow the same blueprint.

The intro establishes that the eponymous Sokoban, or warehouse worker, must perform enough box-pushing puzzles to earn enough cash for a flashy new car so that he might finally impress the girl of his dreams.

An added wrinkle is that each stage has a fixed move limit, and so the player must not only push the boxes in the right order but do so with maximum efficiency. The game was not released outside of Japan.</desc>

		<name>Super Tekkyuu Fight!</name>
		<desc>Super Tekkyuu Fight! ("Super Iron Ball Fight!") is a maze action game featuring characters from the Compati Hero Series, which combines the worlds of Ultraman, SD Gundam, Kamen Rider and the original character Fighter Roar. Rather than relying on explosives, as is the case in the structurally similar Bomberman series, each character has a ball and chain which allows them to damage opponents and destroy blocks. They can acquire bonuses that increases the size of the ball, which causes it to do more damage, and the length of the chain, which increases its range.

The game features a single-player mode where the player takes one of the four protagonists through a series of maze stages that can be attempted in any order, each of which concludes with a boss fight. It also features a multiplayer mode where up to four players can compete for supremacy across a number of stages. Many enemies in the single-player mode use other weapons, like guns, missiles and flamethrowers.</desc>

		<name>Super Tetris 2 + Bombliss</name>
		<desc>Super Tetris 2 + Bombliss is one of the many versions of the famous soviet puzzle game, the first one available for the Super Nintendo, and an updated version of Tetris 2 + Bombliss.

As the title would suggest, the game features both standard Tetris as well as another similar game called Bombliss. Tetris offers three game modes: standard marathon (A-type), start with garbage (B-type), and rising garbage (C-type). There is also a two-player versus mode where clearing rows sends garbage to the other player.

Bombliss is slightly different from normal Tetris. Arranged on the board and in some dropped pieces are bomb squares. Completing a row does not clear the blocks in the row, but will trigger any bombs in the row which will destroy blocks. Different sizes of bombs will generate larger explosions. Bombliss is offered in standard marathon mode, a puzzle mode where a set board must be cleared using set piece drops, and a 2-player versus mode.</desc>

		<name>Super Tetris 3</name>
		<desc>Super Tetris 3 is yet another version of the famous soviet puzzle game. However, despite what the title may suggest, contained within are actually four different versions of Tetris: Tetris Classic, Familiss, Sparkliss, and Magicaliss. Tetris Classic, of course, is the basic version of the game, which comes with an endless mode and a 25-line "standard" mode. Familiss, as the name might suggest, is a family mode for up to four players simultaneously. Sparkliss, meanwhile, is very similar to Bombliss from Super Tetris 2, only with a medieval fantasy theme and different explosion patterns. Sparkliss includes both a stage mode and a puzzle mode.

The most unique mode is Magicaliss, which has never shown up on any other version of Tetris. In Magicaliss, pieces come in three basic colors, and by rotating the piece, the player can choose between them. Creating a line entirely out of one color will clear all blocks on the screen of that color. There are also grey pieces, which can only be cleared by creating a line made entirely from one color, which will cause all grey blocks on screen to become that color. There are also rare rainbow pieces which will act as any color. Besides these additions, the game itself is basic Tetris.

Tetris Classic, Sparkliss, and Magicaliss can also be played in a two-player battle mode, besides the four-player Familiss mode.</desc>

		<path>./Super Trump Collection 2 (Japan).zip</path>
		<name>Super Trump Collection 2</name>
		<desc>Super Trump Collection 2 is a card game compilation and the sequel to 1995's Super Trump Collection. A few of the card games support two players, though most involve AI players.

The sequel increases the number of card games from seven to ten. These games include, in counter-clockwise order on the main menu:

Video Poker: A single-player variant of poker played in casinos, where the goal is to make the best hands and rake in the dough. The player is given the option of going double or nothing with a high/low bonus game after successful hands.
Video Blackjack: A variant of blackjack played in casinos. As with video poker, the player can increase their winnings with a high/low game.
Old Maid: A "shedding" type card game where players remove cards from their hand in pairs.
Speed: A two-player speed shedding game. Players can put cards on one of two discard piles if they're one higher or lower than the card on top. The game is played in real-time, so the player must be fast to win.
Sevens: Players place cards in a grid next to active cards, starting with sevens. If the player can't play a card, they must skip to the next player. If enough cards in one suit have been played, the Ace or King can be placed at the ends.
Memory Match: A single-player game where the player is given a view of a set of pairs in a grid and must recall where each pair is once the cards are turned over.
Rummy: A four-player game where cards must be placed in "melds", either three-in-a-row or three-of-a-kind, until the player runs out of cards. They can also add loose cards to their own or other players' melds.
Crazy Eights: A four-player game where players place cards on a discard pile if they have the same suit or the same number. The exception are eights: these are wild cards, and when placed the player can also change the active suit.
President: A four-player game similar to Crazy Eights, only the winner of the last round gets to claim the best cards of the losers of the last round before starting.
Mau-Mau: A four-player game similar to Crazy Eights, but with an additional set of crazy rules that the players must follow.
Each card game also has a distinct visual theme. For instance, Rummy uses neon signs like Las Vegas, while Sevens has an aquatic theme.</desc>

		<desc>Super Trump Collection is a compilation featuring seven different card games from publisher Bottom Up. It is the first game in their Trump Collection series, which would later make its way onto various other systems. The series also saw one other game for the Super Famicom: Super Trump Collection 2.

The card games include Poker, Blackjack, Crazy Eights, Shichi Narabe (Sevens) and a Memory Match game, as well as two others.

Poker and Blackjack are both presented as their "video" incarnations often seen in casinos, and the player can bet a configurable amount of money on the result before starting. If they win a payout, they have the option of playing a double-or-nothing mini-game to increase their winnings (or potentially lose them). For Poker, the double-or-nothing game involves betting high or low on the next card, while Blackjack has the player guess red or black for the next card.</desc>

The player has a number of customization options for the number of players, special rules and other features. The game also has a bright cartoony style and a number of anime portraits for the player(s) to use.

As with the original card game, the goal is to be the first to play all the cards in the player character's hand. Each player can only play a card if it has the same number or color as the current card on the discard deck, otherwise they need to collect a new card. There are a number of exceptions, such as the Wild Card that can change the color in play. Other cards can put the player's opponents in dire straits, forcing them to add more cards to their deck and reversing the turn order.

The game was released exclusively in Japan for the Super Famicom by Tomy Corporation. Tomy licensed the Uno brand from rival toy giant Mattel.</desc>

		<name>Sutte Hakkun</name>
		<desc>Sutte Hakkun is a puzzle action game in the shape of a platformer. The playing character is an abundant-beaked bird resembling a penguin, named Hakkun, that is able to walk and jump but not to fly. The Rainbow of Happiness shined in the sky above Peaceful Islands: one day it broke apart and now Hakkun has to track down, collect, and put together all rainbow crystals to relive it. The gameplay hinges upon two elements: blocks and potions, the latter of several colours. Hakku makes its way through levels by changing the position of blocks â that will be done by swallowing them to release them on an other place then â and sucking potions â that are to be injected to blocks by the beak, endowing them with new properties consequential to the colour of the fluid â from jars. A level is cleared when the rainbow shards in it are collected. Neither a time limit nor enemy characters are there impeding Hakkun's way. Equally distinctive is the score system: a set number of points is given at the beginning of each level, and a decrease happens with any move made, thus rewarding the player for completing levels with as little moves as possible.

Before reaching the format of a common Super Famicom cartridge, the game was released for and downloadable by the console's add-on Satellaview in four versions. Given data size limitations, only one of the four of those, released for use with the Nintendo Power cartridge, could include all the levels designed by game creators: that is the one released as a Super Famicom standard cartridge later, and on Wii's Virtual console eventually.</desc>

		<name>Tactical Soccer</name>
		<desc>Tactical Soccer is a soccer game published by Electronic Arts, although it was developed by a Japanese team.

Like Zico Soccer, the gameplay is more reminiscent of a strategy game in real time. It takes place before players' eyes so the action (which is represented by a small window at the top of the screen) can't be interrupted.

Each of the 16 national teams have 16 players with different skills (ranging from A to E). During a match, the player gives directions such as force at the center, play on the wings, back in defense, take a long or short pass. Depending on what the player chooses, it is possible to apply the command to a particular player, the player in possession of the ball, a part of the team (defense, midfield, attack) or the whole team. Everything is done relatively simply with combinations of buttons.

There are no headers, bicycle kicks or other fancy movements, scoring goals is only possible by kicking the ball. A replay is played every time a fault is committed (which happen quite often), a shot off target is made, or a goal is scored.</desc>

It was a day like all the others when Cless decided to go hunting with his best friend Chester. Chasing a wild boar, Cless discovered a strange talking tree in the forest who was pleading him for help. But as soon as it stopped speaking, the two friends heard the sound of an alarm. They returned to the village and found it burnt down, and all its inhabitants murdered. Before Cless' mother died in his arms, she told him this terrible massacre had something to do with the pendant she and her husband gave Cless for his birthday... what connection could there be? Cless decides to visit his uncle who lives in another town, but he doesn't realize his journey will take him to much more remote places than that!

"Tales of Phantasia" presents a unique combat system: The battles have a lot in common with fighting games: you fight on a platform that slowly scrolls forward and have to attack your enemy in real time. Other party members are controlled by AI. You can pause the game at any time and use magic, items, or choose an overall strategy for your allies.</desc>

		<name>Tenchi Muyou! : Game Hen</name>
		<desc>Sasami is kidnapped by a mysterious little girl with magical powers, and Tenchi and his companions must travel to rescue her, battling monsters and other creatures on the way.

Tenchi Muyou! Game-Hen is a strategy game with RPG elements, based on the popular Japanese Tenchi Muyo! cartoon series. The game moves from battle to battle, with the plot being revealed through cutscenes between them. The player fights the computer on turns, controlling the individuals from a party of four. The party members are selected on a separate screen before each battle, and as the game progresses new characters become available.

During the skirmish, selecting the characters brings up a menu with three command options: move, attack or end turn. A fourth transform option becomes available later, after they reach a higher level. When moving or attacking, glowing tiles on the ground show the maximum range of the action. Performing either one costs action points, shown as eight regenerating green dots on the status window, alongside basic statistics like health, defense and attack levels. Characters level up automatically while on the battlefield, increasing their abilities and receiving more powerful attacks. Health powers are also accessed through the attack menu, recovering lost points to an ailing comrade within their range. Characters can transform to a more powerful version when they have the ability to do so, and all the eight green dots are still available. The transformed unit has more powerful attacks and a wider range of movement.

After the battle, a map screen appears where the player can save the game, and choose the next battle from one of the available paths. It is possible to revisit battlegrounds, to level up before tackling stronger enemies.

		<name>The Great Battle Gaiden 2 : Matsuri da Wasshoi</name>
		<desc>The Great Battle Gaiden 2: Matsuri da Wasshoi (Matsuri refers to a Japanese festival, at which "wasshoi" is regularly chanted) is an off-beat "gaiden" (side story) game in The Great Battle sub-franchise: the flagship games of the Compati Hero Series. The game is based around an alien invasion during a festival, and the four heroes (Ultraman, Kamen Rider, Knight Gundam from Gundam and Fighter Roar, a character created for The Great Battle series).

The game has a mix of genres. The chief gameplay is a platformer where the player can leap up and down floors similar to Ninja-Kid or Mr. Goemon. If the player enters a flying gate, they are escorted to a shoot 'em up stage in which they control a flying lobster fighting samurai heads and Maneki Nekos.

The Great Battle Gaiden 2 follows the Game Boy game Tekkyu Fight! The Great Battle Gaiden, released the previous year. Like every The Great Battle game and its Japanese pop culture-specific heroes, the game was never localized into English.</desc>

Like Toride it was first released in the Arcade and then to a single home console; in this case the Sega Saturn.nnnnThe player must clear all the tiles on the screen, as per usual mahjong solitaire rules, but in order to do so they have to store matching tiles along the bottom of the screen. The player's "hand" has a limited number of slots available, and if the player fills it up with pieces that don't match then they have failed. There is also a timer for the whole round that ticks down whenever the player is deliberating on their next move, and removing pairs of pieces from play will slightly refill it. There are also special power-up tiles that increase the timer.nnnnAs with mahjong solitaire, the player can only match identical tiles. The exception are the eight unique season and flower tiles, which can be paired off with any other season or flower (though it has to be two seasons or two flowers).</desc>

		<desc>Torneko (aka Taloon) from Dragon Quest IV was a merchant and treasure hunter who always dreamed of owning his own shop. Having defeating the evil along with other heroes, he returned to Endor to work peacefully. Some time has passed and after growing successful in this town, Torneko grew anxious. Hearing rumors one day about a "Mysterious Dungeon", Torneko meets with the king to ask permission to set up a new shop, closer to this Mysterious Dungeon. By exploring this cavern and returning safely with the prizes, Torneko hopes to become the most successful merchant in the world.

Torneko No Daibouken is a overhead view game similar to Hack, what might be called a "dungeon crawl". Torneko must venture into the mysterious dungeon gathering treasure. He may equip any weapons and shields he finds there, as well as gather up items such as spell scrolls, staffs and herbs with a variety of effect. A variety of enemies, familiar to the Dragon Quest series, await him. If Torneko successfully exits the dungeon, he is able to sell any of the items he has collected. This money then goes to improve the quality of his shop and living quarters. As the game progresses, Torneko is able to store special items in the vault, which he is then able to bring with him on subsequent trips to the dungeon.</desc>

Unfortunately, as soon as they begin their quest, they become entangled with a mysterious girl on the run from evil monsters who holds the key to the resurrection of a great demon. Now its up to the brothers to save the world if they ever want to find their father.

Treasure Hunter G is a top-down RPG in which you control your party of four characters as they explore the fantasy/sci-fi game world in search for quests and grinding their stats while the plot advances. The game is divided in a world-map screen, a top-down "town" mode and a turn-based fight mode in which the characters are taken to generic tiled top-down arenas in which they select each character and move or attack depending on their action points.

Enemies can be seen on the map instead of jumping at you at random intervals, and you can freely decide whether to engage them or simply circle them around. The game uses a combination of hand-drawn sprites and CGI pre-rendered one (mostly for the main characters) with a distinct cute or Super Deformed design (as usual for most console RPGs).</desc>

The goal of the game is to compete with a series of characters from Tsuyoshi Shikkari Shinasai depending on who the player selected.nnnnPlay involves stacking duos of faces of various colors. If the player completes a set of three faces - they don't have to be lined up, but they do need to be adjacent - the faces disappear. If they are next to a "trapped" face it is transformed into a normal face block. Ideally, the player completes a three-strong stack of identical-colored trapped faces and frees them in groups of three, which will then lead to a chain as those three vanish and free more trapped faces.nnnnThe game was the first home console version of Konami's Taisen Puzzle-Dama series and the second game overall. The first version was the Arcade game Taisen Puzzle-Dama released earlier the same year. Future Taisen Puzzle-Dama games would also similarly feature anime license tie-ins, as well as characters from Konami's other properties.</desc>

The first part of every level is a scrolling shooter where Tekkaman Blade must survive several waves of Radam before killing two stronger boss-like Radam and meeting another Tekkaman. In scrolling shooter levels Blade can either toss his spear to defeat enemies at range or quickly slash with it to destroy bullets and enemies. One enemy type will drop different colored System Box powerups: green restores health, red destroys all enemies onscreen (except bosses), and blue turns Blade invulnerable and able to destroy all enemies upon contact (including bosses).

The end of every level is a one on one fight with an enemy Tekkaman. Each Tekkaman starts with a weapon, but the weapon will be lost if they take too much damage, forcing them to use punches and kicks. This mode can also be played in 2-player mode, where each player selects their Tekkaman.</desc>

Every mode in the game offers the option of a CPU vs. CPU match if the player simply wants to watch a simulated game.nnnnThe game also features the series's trademark "Ultra" teams, which are fictional teams/athletes that can call upon superpowers to increase their prowess as batters, pitchers and fielders.</desc>

		<name>Ultra Baseball Jitsumei Ban</name>
		<desc>Ultra Baseball Jitsumeiban is the third game in the Ultra Baseball (Baseball Simulator in the USA) series. It was released in 1992 for the Super Famicom by Culture Brain exclusively in Japan. The game remains much the same as the previous 1991 Super Baseball Simulator 1.000 with some new additions. This title included real life players from the NPB league; the word Jitsumeiban means Real Player Version. Additionally a World Series championship and an All-Stars option was added to this version.

In the game, there are three leagues: Central, Pacific and Ultra. Each league has six teams. In the Ultra League, pitchers and batters have special power-ups that boost their abilities which gives the game a surrealistic feel that is rare in the sports genre. Players can even create their own baseball teams and assign special moves to the players that they name themselves. The game can be played in exhibition, season or All-Stars modes.

Though the game was never released worldwide, an unofficial English translation was created by VX Translations</desc>

There are almost 50 fields (levels) but most have multiple exits that allow you to play through the game on different paths without playing every single field in order.

		<name>Ushio to Tora</name>
		<desc>Ushio to Tora ("Ushio and Tora") is a game based on the manga of the same name. It features Ushio Aotsuki, a young man who discovers the powerful Beast Spear that his ancestor used to trap a vicious youkai monster called Tora (Japanese for "tiger"). Recovering the spear causes not only Tora to be free, but draws many other evil youkai out from hiding. Tora works begrudgingly with Ushio to fight back the wave of youkai out of fear of the spear's power (though as the manga progresses, Tora's reasons for helping become more altruistic).

The game is a side-scrolling brawler with short stages that culminate in boss fights with other youkai, similar to the Super Famicom GeGeGe no Kitarou game. The player can choose between Ushio and Tora to control, and each controls slightly differently: Ushio has greater range with the spear and can create shockwaves, while Tora is a powerhouse up close with his claws and can summon bolts of lightning.</desc>

If a sumo reaches the edge of the ring, or loses all their stamina, they lose the match.</desc>

		<name>Wonder Project J : Kikai no Shounen Pino</name>
		<desc>There was once a great scientist and inventor named Gepetto, who lived on an island farm together with his creations, his robotic helper, the pixie Tinker, and his pet animals. His greatest creation was an artificial boy named Pino. No, he was not carved from wood, but looked just like a real boy - only he could turn his head 360 degrees. But Gepetto was arrested for an unknown reason. The boy Pino looks like a real boy, but he was completed just a few moments ago, and he knows absolutely nothing. All he can do is wander aimlessly, poking objects and turning his head. It is up to you, the player, to make Pino a real man!

In this simulation/role-playing game, you must use the robotic pixie Tinker to educate Pino. You can move Tinker around, examining objects and collecting them in an adventure-like fashion. Pino will automatically follow you to the direction you are facing, but will continue walking until you stop him. He will also pick objects and make his own "experiments" with them. Your goal is to train PIno in various disciplines. His stats can be raised in a RPG style: reading books increases his intelligence, throwing a ball increases his dexterity, and so on. By praising or scolding Pino you will gradually make him understand what should be done and what not.

Rather than controlling the character directly with the d-pad and buttons, the players charge attacks and unleash them at the right amount of power. Combat is depicted as a series of dramatic cutaways as each fighter launches their attacks and the other tries to defend or evade them.nnnnYuYu Hakusho, an anime series about a teenage delinquent that is recruited by the underworld to fight demons and spirits that have escaped into the normal world, saw multiple adaptations for the Super Famicom and other consoles. Most are straightforward fighter games, though this and its predecessor YuYu Hakusho use this timing-based variant.</desc>

They can select from an exhibition match, a penalty shoot-out mode or a tournament called the Human Cup.nnnnNewly added to the second Super Formation Soccer is the inclusion of three and four player multiplayer, with the use of a multitap peripheral. There are pre-set options for one vs one, two vs one (the one can be human or CPU) and two vs two, rather than the now standard system of allowing each player to move their controller icon to either team.</desc>

A single swordsman stood in defiance. The four powers that protect the world, the Guardians, gave him their power, and with it the swordsman slew the demon and restored peace in the world. 

Thousand years have passed. And a new battle is already on the way. A cruel emperor leads his troops towards conquest. The kingdom of Panakeia is defending itself with the aid of its knights. Once again, the ominous star shines in the sky, indicating the demon's revival. With the help of Alcahest's power, the evil emperor wants to conquer the world. But the new generation also brings the new hero - the brave swordsman Alen. Aided by the Guardians, Alen must stop the Empire's evil plans and to destroy Alcahest once again.

This is an action game with RPG elements. You wander around slaying enemies in real time combat, gathering treasure on the way, and occasionally participating in boss battles. When you gather enough experience from fighting, you gain extra hit points. You can also upgrade your weapons. On the way you'll meet some characters who will join your party for short time, and you'll be able to use their special attacks and magic.</desc>

		<desc>The year is 1880. Two meteors fell on Earth on a small island near North American Pacific Coast. In the middle of the island there is a small town governed by a sheriff. At first, the town's inhabitants didn't pay attention to the meteors. But then, strange things started happening. Monsters attacked people, and left on the victims' bodies a mysterious crest with one word: demiseed. One day you, a young boy who lives in the town, are contacted by two aliens who came in a miniature space ship. One of the aliens introduces himself as Zero, the Space Sheriff, and explains that an intergalactic criminal named Demi has escaped from justice and is hiding somewhere on the island, being the cause of all the troubles lately. Zero then possesses your body, lends you his powers, and commands you on the quest to destroy Demi and to bring peace to your island and to the alien world alike!

The game is an action/adventure with slight RPG elements (buying and upgrading weapons, etc.) set in Wild West. While featuring traditional dungeon-crawling and many enemies to dispose of in real time combat, the game doesn't equip you with standard medieval swords, but with pistols, shotgun, machine gun, and even a flamethrower. Your weapons have infinite ammo. You can duck to avoid the alien monsters' fire, and perform special attacks with various types of weapons.</desc>

		<name>Fire Pro Joshi : All Star Dream Slam</name>
		<desc>Fire Pro Joshi All-Star Dream Slam (also known as Zen-Nippon Joshi Pro Wrestling Kounin: Fire Pro Joshi All-Star Dream Slam) is an all-female wrestling game from Human Entertainment and uses their 16-bit isometric Fire Pro Wrestling engine. The wrestlers are all taken from the Zen-Nippon Joshi Pro Wrestling ("All Japan Women's Pro Wrestling") circuit, an exclusively female wrestling promotion that lasted for many years in Japan.

As with prior Fire Pro Wrestling games, the mechanics behind the moves, pins and submissions rely more on timing and rhythm than button-mashing. Each bout is depicted with an isometric perspective, and various configurations of single-player and two-player controls are available for one-on-one matches and tag teams. The game features 18 pre-generated wrestlers and six create-a-wrestler slots.</desc>

		<name>Kunio-kun no Dodge Ball Da yo Zenin Shuugou!</name>
		<desc>16-bit sequel to the cult-classic Super Dodge Ball which unfortunately only saw a Japanese release.

The game continues the "Worldwide Dodge Ball tournament" motif of the original in which several teams from around the world compete in side scrolling dodge ball matches to see which one is the best. Gameplay is similar to other sport games in which you control the character that has the ball at the time (although a lead character always marks the formations and generally controls the team), and special moves can be executed to try and eliminate your opponents (such as homing throws and other esoteric moves). 

This sequel also adds more comprehensive tournament mechanics, for instance your performance in each match allows you to buy power-ups and special moves to enhance your players, you can also create a custom team and manage them throughout the tournament by adding or removing members as you see fit (you can even try to lure players from opposing teams). You can also choose among a series of formations and AI profiles in case you play alone, although you can use a multi-tap to play with up to 4 players.

Available game modes include Tournament, Vs and Mechabutsuke mode which is a variation on Vs that involves a free-roaming court and no outfielders.</desc>

		<name>Dark Half</name>
		<desc>Through the Light came the Darkness, and through the Darkness came the Light. They were inseparable in the beginning, and gave birth to each other. Rukyu appeared before all the other creatures, the great demon of darkness, later to be known as the Satan. The divine hero-god Roda went up to his dark realm to defeat him, but was struck down, and presumed dead. But the hero couldn't die so easily: he swore to defeat Rukyu once and for all. Meanwhile, Rukyu doesn't just stay in his realm, waiting for Roda: he goes out to the world as a death-bringing sorcerer, and he is out for Roda...

The game is quite different from most other RPGs, because it lets you play as both the "good" hero and the villain. The game is divided into chapters, and each chapter is played by either Roda or Rukyu. You switch the two heroes chapter-after-chapter, and lead them to their ultimate battle from two opposite sides. The entire game, including the battles, is viewed from an isometric perspective. The battles are random and turn-based, and the battle field is divided into squares you can position and move your characters on. Both Roda and Rukyu can have party members join them, and both attack mostly with magic. Rukyu uses a special energy called "Soul Power", while Roda cast one-time spells from scrolls he receives after battles.</desc>
