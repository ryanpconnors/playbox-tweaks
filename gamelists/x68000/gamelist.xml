		<name>Cyber Core</name>
		<desc>Cyber-core is a vertically scrolling shooter in which the player fights insects. The basic idea is traditional: shooting everything before they can shoot/touch the player: after three hits the chitin armor breaks and a life is lost. Besides flying enemies which are disposed of with the standard gun, the player also has to deal with enemies on the ground which need to be hit with one of the unlimited bomb. 

The player has the choice between four insect forms which are changed by collecting the associated extra symbols. Collecting more of the same symbol upgrades the insect, but this also rises the difficulty level. Other extras include smart bombs, extra lives, armor refreshments or a protection shield. The game features the possibility to turn on rapid fire or to slow down the speed as well as big boss enemies at the end and within the levels.</desc>

And it won't matter whether he fights in his shining armor or in his underwear alone...the bravest Knight in the land isn't going to be stopped by some monsters! Although the game starts with graveyard and marsh territory familiar from the first game, later levels are set in a tower, a mass of skeletons, and a castle.</desc>

		<path>./Darius (19xx)(Hasamichi).m3u</path>
		<name>Darius</name>
		<desc>Darius was Taito's effort to compete in the arcades against the likes of R-Type and Gradius. Technically impressive, it featured three screens depicting the largest playfield seen in a game so far (the same system was employed for Ninja Warriors), with the player sitting atop a big set of loudspeakers. Visually and audibly, it was a league above Irem's and Konami's offerings.

When Taito (and others) ported the game to home machines, they were forced to shrink the playfield to fit in one single screen, and re-dubbed it Darius Plus.

The plot of Darius involves the two heroes Proco Jr. and Tiat Young fighting the menaces posed by galactic fish and other sea animals again their homeworld.

What sets Darius apart from other shoot'em-ups of the time is its way of letting the player choose his path with a certain amount of freedom. At the end of each area (level), you are able to choose between one of two worlds which the area branches into. This renders a higher replay value, since there are many paths to reach the end of the game by.
Apart from this, the gameplay is on the simplistic side, both due to unimaginative attack waves and little interaction with the surroundings, but mainly due to the very basic powerup system, which is nowhere near the complexity of the aforementioned R-Type's and Gradius'.</desc>

		<desc>There's plenty of reflection in this game, in both senses of the word. That's because this strategic puzzler involves using mirrors to direct a beam of light across a succession of 60 screens. Each mirror has 16 different angles it can be set at, each of which will send the beam around the screen in different ways.

Before the exit is activated, all the mines on a screen must be cleared by running the beam over them. There are other devices built into the levels, including teleports and random angle-changers, as well as hazards to avoid (they cause the beam to overheat) and droids which go around moving the mirrors' directions.</desc>

		<name>Dig Dug</name>
		<desc>Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth. Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the monsters will get turned back to their normal selves). Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you can get these for points.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Buster</name>
		<desc>Originating in the arcades, Dragon Buster is an action platform game composed out of several large levels, each one containing various stages: a cave, a tower, a castle, etc. The player's goal in every level is to reach the final stage where the protagonist faces the level boss. There are often several ways to reach the final stages, and not all stages are necessary to visit. Equipped with a sword, the player character moves through platform stages, clearing them of diverse monsters, collecting power-ups and trying to stay in good health until the level boss, since it is impossible to heal between the stages. The hero's life meter (called "vitality" in the game) is the first introduction of such a feature to action games.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Spirit</name>
		<desc>Princess Alicia of the kingdom of Mitgult is kidnapped by the monster Zawell. It's now up to the heroic warrior Amul to transform himself into a blue dragon and go and rescue the princess.

Dragon Spirit is a  vertically scrolling shoot-em-up which consists of nine stages. Players fly around and destroy everything in their path.  Much like in Xevious, action takes place on two planes, both in the sky (where the dragon is flying) and on the ground.  The dragon has two different kind of attacks: fire that shoots up the screen, and fire that drops to hit a place on the ground in front of the dragon.  Enemies exist both in the air and on the ground, and some can fly up from the ground to the sky.

Players can pick up power-ups, or upgrades, that will help them in their fight.  Upgrades can include extra heads on the dragon, health, faster shots, and more. At the end of each stage is a boss that needs to be defeated. Having good upgrades that are not lost from being hit before reaching the bosses will help.

The NES version is unique in that it presents a somewhat altered story and an additional gameplay mode.  Technically, it is a sort of sequel, with "A New Legend" being its subtitle.  In this version, Zawell is already defeated and King Amul and his now wife Queen Alicia, have two children named Iris (a princess) and Lace (a prince). A new evil named Galda has decided to attack the Earth. Galda also has taken Iris captive and now Lace must go rescue her. 

The NES version also adds a new initial stage.  If the player survives it, the game continues in a "Blue Dragon" game much like the original arcade game.  If the player fails to clear this initial stage in one life, an easy mode called "Gold Dragon" begins, skipping about half the game's stages, giving the player extra hit points, and features a different ending.

Also of note, the TurboGrafx-16 version's seventh and eighth stage are different than the other versions. The underwater and dark themed stages were changed to castle interior themed stages.</desc>

		<name>Full Throttle</name>
		<desc>Future technology paved way to the creation of hovercrafts, which began to gradually replace motorized vehicles. Ben is the leader of the Polecats, one of the toughest biker gangs on the road. One day he drives over and damages a hovercraft limousine which belongs to Malcolm Corley, owner of Corley Motors, the last domestic motorcycle manufacturer. Later, Ben is having a bit of good clean fun at the Kick Stand Bar when Corley drops by for a bit of reminiscing. This leads to a meeting with Corley Motors' vice president Adrian Ripburger, who has his own sinister plans concerning the company, the Polecats, and the future of motorized vehicles. Ben refuses to co-operate and must now face the consequences and do everything in his power to bring Ripburger to justice.

Full Throttle is a third-person puzzle-solving adventure game. The graphics are cartoon-style, similarly to LucasArts' previous adventure games Day of the Tentacle and Sam &amp; Max Hit The Road. The game features a revamped interface: instead of choosing a command verb or an action icon and then interacting with an object, the player can now simply point at it, and the available action icons will appear automatically. These include the standard "use", "examine", and "speak" actions, but also a separate foot icon for kicking. 

As in other LucasArts adventure games, the player can select different responses during most conversations. However, compared to their previous works in the genre, Full Throttle is more streamlined, with less exploration, dialogue options or puzzles. Cinematic cartoon-style cutscenes are used to advance the plot. The game also includes a few simple action driving sequences, during which the player is required to navigate a motorcycle and fight hostile bikers by punching and kicking them, as well as using crude weapons such as chains and planks.</desc>

		<name>Galaga '88</name>
		<desc>Galaga '88 takes the basic gameplay of Galaga and adds higher-quality graphics, triple ship abilities, parsec progression, power-ups, asteroids, bosses and other enhancements. Periodically the player encounters Challenging Stages, which are set to music and feature "dancing" enemies.  The objective is to shoot all 40 enemies before they disappear, for a bonus of at least 10,000 points. There are a total of 29 stages. The player can begin with one ship with two in reserve or start right out with a dual ship (but only one in reserve).  

Some enemies now have the ability to combine into a much larger single enemy that takes multiple shots to destroy. Others explode in a brilliant shower of fireworks when destroyed, and occasionally these enemies drop a small formation of much smaller enemies that "wiggle" their way down the screen.  Some enemies arrive in spherical "eggs" and emit a loud, high-pitched noise when hit. These creatures take multiple hits to destroy in flight (just one hit in formation), and their main attack pattern is to move about halfway down the screen, stop, fire multiple shots at once, and then fly straight down off the bottom of the screen.  Another type of enemy takes at least five hits to destroy, and it grows larger with each consecutive hit, making it both a larger target and allowing it to act as a shield to other enemies. 

Later in the game some enemies are equipped with armor that renders them invincible while in formation. When one of these enemies starts its dive, it will flip over and expose its vulnerable side, then flip over again and become invincible while it moves back up the screen, then flip one more time and finish its dive. While vulnerable, this enemy can be destroyed in one hit, scoring bonus points. In addition, many different kinds of obstacles appear throughout the game, including blue crystals, boulders and green blobs.</desc>

		<name>Galaga</name>
		<desc>Galaga is a vertical arcade shooter from Namco.  You control a space fighter at the bottom of the screen, scrolling left and right in order to avoid oncoming bombs and kamikaze attacks from alien invaders--and to fire your own missiles to fight back!

There are an infinite number of stages to progress through.  Every third level is a "challenge stage" in which you have a free chance to shoot as many aliens as possible and rack up bonus points.

Certain aliens have tractor beams they can use to capture one of your ships.  If that wasn't your last "life," you can try to shoot that alien down and recapture your ship, giving you two ships at once and doubling your firepower.

A summary screen appears when the game is over, giving you both your final score and you final "hit ratio"--the number of missiles fired, enemies destroyed, and the percentage of targets hit.</desc>

		<desc>Galaxian is a shoot 'em up in which the player is at the bottom of the screen, with an arrangement of aliens at the top. The player moves left and right to aim at an alien, then shoots a bullet up the screen, and the alien it hits is killed. The aliens are classed as Drones, Emissaries, Hornets and Commanders, with those higher up the screen scoring more points when destroyed. At set intervals an enemy will move down the screen towards you, escorting a bomber, which is a moment of high danger. Clear a wave and another is generated.</desc>

Gemini Wing is a vertically-scrolling shoot 'em up, which is distinguished by its unusual power-up system. Instead of gaining occasional tokens which lead to lasting weaponry improvements, occasional flurries of tokens are released to ensure a quick burst of improved fire. The organic backgrounds are detailed, and have many sections which fire at the player character.</desc>

		<name>Heavy Nova</name>
		<desc>In an era of frequent alien attacks, the Earth has a unified Government, which relies on a line of cyborgs known as the Heavy Dolls for defense. The greatest of these are known as the Heavy Nova, a title earned by passing a rigorous training regime.

You are taking on the simulated proving grounds, which are split into two styles of alternating action. In the first you must progress (initially purely horizontally, though later with vertical flick-scrolling as well) through a hostile environment of enemies, bombs and traps, gaining points for doing it quickly and with lots of energy left. Initially you can fly and kick as needed.

Once this section is complete, you move on to one-on-one combat of the Street Fighter 2 style. The early foes have far less energy than you begin with. As you progress through the game, you are awarded extra attacking moves, in a manner similar to Brutal: Paws of Fury.</desc>

Forward movement is automated, but changing altitude to engage aerial enemies in combat or blast stationary machines is essential. Once in an indoor environment, the player character is navigated in a more common side-scrolling fashion, though altitude continues to play an important role. Power-ups include health-restoring items (repair kits), additional weaponry, etc.</desc>

Now equipped with arms, face, and legs, Pac must guide a fairy back to her home in Fairy Land, but this task will not be easy because Inky, Blinky, Pinky, Clyde, and Sue will pursue Pac-Man as he travels through Pac-Land. When he finally transports the fairy back to her home, Pac is given some magic shoes, which will help him get to his own home, where he will be greeted by his family: Ms. Pac-Man, Baby Pac-Man, Chomp Chomp, and Sourpuss. 

There are sixteen rounds to complete, with four trips each. During each round, he can grab a power pellet, which cause ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for points. Points are also awarded by collecting fruit that appear, like cherries and strawberries. In some rounds, Pac must use a springboard to jump over a lake. He must also make it to the end of each round before time runs out, otherwise a ghost will chase him.</desc>

		<desc>One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.

Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde).  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.

Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze.  During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points.  This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghosts' eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.</desc>

		<path>./R-Type (1989)(Irem).m3u</path>
		<name>R-Type</name>
		<desc>R-Type is a side scrolling shoot 'em up best known for its extremely tough and strategic gameplay.  You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire.

The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called "The Force", which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements).

The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger's artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the memorisation that is required of R-Type's contemporary rival, Gradius.</desc>

		<desc>Scorpius is a horizontally scrolling shoot-em-up in which the player can choose to control one of the three available spaceships on their way through exotic planets populated by hostile alien races. The ships vary in shape and use modified versions of basic weapon types. Each ship starts with a low-damage gun and can upgrade and change the weapon to spreading fire, slow but powerful lightning attack, and others. The ships are also equipped with a claw-like tail, which is activated with a separate button. The tail can attack enemies in a circular motions and retracts back to the ship. Most stages require alternating between firearms and the tail for successful completion.</desc>

		<name>Star Luster</name>
		<desc>In Star Luster, the player controls Dan Heinick, a pilot of the starfighter Gaia. He is tasked with having to fight the evil being Battura and its minions, who are bent on controlling the entire universe.

The game is played from an inside the cockpit view. Players select a location on their interplanetary map and warp to it. Locations that can be flown to include spots that contain enemy clusters and bases. Players have to be aware of the enemy locations, as the enemies can attack and destroy planets and bases if they come close enough to them.

When players reach an enemy cluster they have to seek out the enemy ships to engage in battle with, and then blast them away with either laser fire or photon torpedoes. Once all the enemies in a sector are defeated, the player can move on to another location. Firing shots and moving costs the spaceship energy. If the ship is running low on energy, the player has the option to visit a base to refill their energy. Bases can also repair the ships' radar, computer, and engine if they have become to damaged from enemy attacks. The ship also contains a rechargeable shield. Getting hit will temporarily drain the shield, while avoiding enemy fire for a while will refill it.

The game features three modes of play. Training mode and Command mode are easier versions of the Adventure mode. They mainly try to get the player prepared for the Adventure mode. The Adventure mode features the most groups of enemies that have to be dealt with and requires the most planning to defend the planets successfully. The Adventure mode also features an optional objective which involves collecting keys from seven different planets in order to access a 
hidden final planet.</desc>

Each level includes a bonus section filled with coins plus a shortcut through the level, plenty of bad buys and obstacles to get past, and an end of level flag, in which the higher the player grabs it, the more points are awarded to them.

		<desc>Syvalion  is a shoot 'em up game in which you take control of a spaceship shaped as a dragon and divided in several segments. The spaceships/dragon can move freely across the screen in all directions and has to fight off robots, spaceships and bosses with his fire attack. When using the fire attack the fuel meter at the bottom off the screen depletes but moving around recharges the meter. Along the way are also indestructible obstacles that have to be evaded. The segments serve as hit points and when taking damage a segment changes color. The game features the following modes:

 Basic Series: A mode in witch you receive instruction and tips on how to play the game;
 Real Combat Series: A story mode;
 Time Attack: A mode where you need to gather as many points as possible before the time reaches zero.

The game was later also released as part of a compilation called Taito Legends 2 for the PlayStation 2.

On each level you have a quota of enemies that need to be destroyed. After fulfilling your quota, a final boss of the level will appear; when destroyed, you will move on to the next level. The game begins in the year 1910, and each time a level is completed you advance in time. In 1910 you only have to face relatively unarmed biplanes, but as the levels advance so does the technology. Each new level brings with it tougher, more heavily armed aircraft including jets, helicopters, and even flying saucers! From time to time, you will encounter a parachute; if you run into this, you will earn bonus points.</desc>

		<name>Xevious</name>
		<desc>A hundred thousand years ago, an ancient civilization prospered on our Earth, their product being GAMP (General Artificial Matrix Producer). In order to survive the Ice Age, most of the Earth's inhabitants have decided to leave it, finally settling on a planet called Xevious. A group of humans remained, becoming our own ancestors. Many years have passed, and the Xevians are now planning a massive comeback to their long-lost homeland. The pilot Mu, his android companion Eve, and Mio, a Xevian who opposes the GAMP regime, are back from a space travel just in time to warn the Earth of the upcoming invasion. The prototype fighter craft Solvalou is going to be used as the main weapon against the Xevian attack.

Xevious is a vertically-scrolling shooter which is notable for being the first game of that type to feature an aircraft flying over the Earth (as opposed to the outer space in other games), displaying views of South American nature. It also introduced, for the first time, two types of enemies to fight: aerial and ground-based (the menacing SOL towers invoked by GAMP to aid their planes). The player-controlled ship, Solvalou, is equipped with two weapons, each assigned to a button: the Zapper for air enemies, and the Blaster, which drops bombs on ground targets with the aid of a lock-on. The aerial enemies are divided into sub-categories distinguished by their attack and behavior patterns. Certain enemy types are immune to Solvalou's weapons, and must be avoided. </desc>

		<desc>As an undercover agent of Chase Headquarters, your job is to patrol the streets and track down five criminals. You are given a mission briefing before you start which gives information on the suspect and what car they drive. Then you drive across the city without crashing into other cars, and catch up with the criminal's car. To arrest the suspects, you must keep bumping into their car until it is no longer functional. And you have to do this under a strict time limit. You can't afford to crash into cars or buildings or you waste time getting on the road again. 

However, once you've caught up with your suspect, you are given more time. Your car is also equipped with turbo boosts, which you can use to gain extra speed if you are way behind the criminal. Each arrest is based on a "suspicion".

		<name>Chourensha 68K</name>
		<desc>Cho Ren Sha 68k (Ultra Fire 68K) is a top-down vertically scrolling DÅjinshi shoot 'em up. It was originally released in 1995 and later it was ported to PC. It is a shooter with classic mechanics modeled after the Toaplan games. There is one ship and it can be moved around freely. Shooting needs to be done manually as there is no autofire. Points are earned by killing enemies, completing levels and collecting items. It has seven stages with up to eight loops and a final boss after a few. Red power-up ships that are shot leave behind one of three items: a weapon upgrade, a bomb that clears the entire screen and a one-hit shield that also explodes when it disappears.</desc>

		<path>./Neural Gear.m3u</path>
		<name>Neural Gear</name>
		<desc>Neural Gear is a pseudo-3D scrolling shooter similar to Space Harrier. You play as Emi T. Fonon, a futuristic soldier from the years after World War IV, who wears a bio-powered suit that can fly back in time and destroy time travelling robots. Each level goes back to an earlier date and has more numerous and powerful enemies.

The game is completely controlled with the mouse. Left clicking fires the main weapon - yellow energy balls, while right clicking fires a sub weapon, which is chosen at the start of the level. There are four sub weapons to choose from: SPC that shoots powerful blue energy balls, Rockets, Homing Missiles and the most powerful sub weapon in the game "???" which is actually a bomb that can instantly kill all enemies on screen, including bosses but it also take out around 500-600 health.

An interesting feature of this game is the health system. The timer at the top of the screen also acts as the health bar and it decreases faster when you get hit. Enemies come in large groups, sometimes in formations, and shooting twenty enemies will refill your timer 200 points. Getting to the end of a level also adds a certain amount to the timer depending on the level.

		<name>Pac-Mania</name>
		<desc>Pac-Mania is a variation on the game Pac-Man. You need to guide Pac-Man around a maze and eat all of the dots on the board in order to proceed on to the next round. Numerous, multi-colored ghosts also roam the maze trying to stop you. If you eat one of the power pellets in the maze, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and run from you. Pac-Man can earn bonus points by eating the ghosts when they are in this state. The maze is now shown in isometric perspective and is larger than screen which will scroll to follow the action. To help get out of tight spots, Pac-Man now has the ability to jump. But be careful, because some of the ghosts have learned this trick as well and you could end up in a mid air collision! </desc>
